AB  - Agriculture in general and intensive animal production in particular can degrade the environment, especially as a consequence of the overuse of nutrients. Intensively grazed dairy systems, defined by the presence of foraging animals in the landscape, are often considered a more benign approach to dairy production with perceived smaller impacts due to the reduced requirement for manure disposal. However, grazing dairy cows contribute nutrients and pathogens in excreta, and sediment through landscape deformation. These impacts can dramatically increase in parts of the farm such as feeding, watering and sacrifice areas, laneways and night paddocks where animals are concentrated and spend a disproportionate amount of time. Other practices such as the disposal of dairy shed or dairy factory effluent and cultivation of fodder crops can also pollute the environment. A common approach to reduce nutrient, pathogen and sediment losses from dairy farms is to establish buffer zones in riparian areas that act as an interface between upland land use and waterways. This is generally done by fencing riparian areas to exclude stock and revegetating with understory and overstory species, with the aim of increasing infiltration, trapping sediment and decreasing contaminant losses from upland pastures. However, poorly designed and managed riparian areas may themselves contribute to further environmental degradation. Rarely is an integrated approach, including factors such as animal behavior and dairy farm management practices, as well as an analysis of landscape and riparian hydrology used in developing riparian management recommendations for individual farms. This paper reviews the threats posed by intensively grazed dairy systems, approaches to improve riparian zone management and recommends future research needs.

AB  - Hunting, as an activity implemented over wildlife, and because of its associated management, can have effects on other species. Most frequently used management tools for small game include habitat modifications, provision of supplementary food or water, predator control or release of farm-reared animals. Information reviewed shows that maintaining appropriate habitats for game animals (a heterogeneous landscape with natural vegetation patches within the farmland matrix, vegetation along field edges) and provision of supplementary food and water frequently benefit non-game species. Predator control could be beneficial for certain non-game prey, but this effect is not observed in all studied species. In addition, this tool is associated with the use of illegal methods with very detrimental effects on protected predators. Very intensive management, particularly when based on releases of farm-reared animals, is apparently detrimental for certain species. Disturbance associated with hunting activities also appears to have negative effects on some non-game species. These results show that management combining conservation of adequate habitats, an appropriate use of feeders and water points, hunting based on wild populations (without releases of farm-reared animals), regulating hunting pressure, maintaining hunt-free reserves within the hunting estates, and sometimes the use of a legal and selective predator control, could benefit other species of conservation concern.

AB  - The fate of field-applied herbicides, including losses in surface runoff with water and sediment, is highly dependent on herbicide properties. The two most important properties are soil adsorption and persistence. Adsorption affects the potential for a herbicide to be lost primarily with sediment, runoff water, or possibly leaching water. Solubility, often though not always inversely correlated with adsorption, is of secondary importance, although low solubility can limit transport with water. Persistence affects the time available to be lost in runoff. Studies have shown that for soil-applied herbicides, extraction into runoff water or movement with sediment takes place from a thin soil layer at the surface. In addition, for herbicides studied, there is little interaction between surface crop residue and applied herbicides, and washoff from the residue readily occurs with small amounts of rainfall. Runoff loss equals the volume of carrier (water or sediment) times the concentration in that carrier; therefore, practices that reduce either, or both, can reduce losses. Rate of application has been directly related to concentration and therefore loss. Reducing rate, such as by banding, soil incorporation, and avoidance of application to crop residue reduce losses. The choice of herbicide and herbicide formulation, in conjunction with application technology, as they affect properties, rate, and placement, play a large role in determining runoff loss. Runoff losses of herbicides that are strongly adsorbed and therefore transported mainly with sediment can be reduced by erosion control; runoff volume reduction can reduce losses with water of moderately to weakly adsorbed herbicides. Conservation tillage has potential to reduce both runoff and erosion. Timing of application relative to expected intense storms, both in the short and long term, can reduce the potential for runoff. If possible to determine thresholds, herbicide use could be avoided if weed infestation is below the economic effect level. Buffer or filter strips have the potential to reduce transport of herbicides lost from fields to surface water resources.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has led to a widespread decline in farmland biodiversity measured across many different taxa. The changes in agricultural practices affect many different aspects of the farmland habitat, but agricultural industry, policy and much previous research has tended to be concerned with specific sectors or practices (e.g. pesticide use or cereal husbandry). Here, we review the empirical literature to synthesize the research effort that has been directed to investigate specific practices or goals to make general statements regarding the causes and consequences of farmland biodiversity decline. We argue that the loss of ecological heterogeneity at multiple spatial and temporal scales is a universal consequence of multivariate agricultural intensification and, therefore, that future research should develop cross-cutting policy frameworks and management solutions that recreate that heterogeneity as the key to restoring and sustaining biodiversity in temperate agricultural systems.

AB  - Annual herbaceous windbarriers can have certain advantages over perennial woody shelterbelts in that they are easier, faster and cheaper to establish, and may allow more flexibility in the farming operation. Their primary function is to reduce windspeed, which in turn generally improves growing conditions for the adjacent plants by improving temperature and moisture conditions. Annual windbarriers can be effective in increasing crop yields, controlling wind erosion, preventing sandblast damage to crop plants and trapping snow where it will be of maximum benefit in increasing soil water. Barrier porosity should be 65-75% for snow management and 40-50% for all other applications. Plants used should be as resistant to lodging as possible. Barriers should be comprised of two or more rows of plants, oriented perpendicular to the erosive or snow-laden winds (or in a serpentine manner if there is no predominant wind direction), spaced properly and established early enough to give the necessary protection to the adjacent area. © 1988.

AB  - The use of vegetative filter strips (VFSs) in the mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads from agriculturally derived overland flows is a widespread practice. VFSs have been used in a wide variety of situations to treat runoff from croplands, feed lots, dairy operations, confined animal feeding operations, and roadsides, among other locations. While vegetative matter must regularly be removed from vegetative filter strips in an effort to prevent them from becoming nutrient load sources, very limited attempts have been made (with the exception of biofuel harvesting) to harvest that biomass for a useable purpose. This dissertation examines the novel approach of establishing vegetative filter strips on the ends of surface-irrigated, row-cropped fields with commonly utilized forage species for the direct mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads in overland flow while concurrently producing a marketable forage crop. A review of the pertinent literature is provided followed by a detailed overview of the experimental setup. Five commonly utilized forage crops were used to establish vegetative filter strips of varying lengths on the ends of furrow-irrigated, row-cropped fields in an arid environment. Vegetative filter strips of 3.05 (10 ft), 6.07 m (20 ft), and 9.14 m (30 ft) in width were found to have removal efficiencies exceeding 99% for: total inflow volume, total suspended solids, NO 3 -N, NH4 -H, PO4 -P and total P while yielding marketable forage biomass at a rates roughly comparable to average yields from regional hay farms. Statistical analyses on mean removal efficiencies showed a significant statistical difference among the performance of VFS width and vegetation cover type for mean suspended sediment removal efficiencies, and among vegetation cover type for NH4-N mean removal efficiencies. No significant statistical difference was shown among either vegetation cover types or VFS width for mean removal efficiencies of NO 3 -N, PO4 -P or total P. NH4 -N removal among differing VFS lengths was shown not to be statistically different.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of how energy crop cultivations in Sweden, consisting of short-rotation forest (Salix) and energy grass (reed canary grass), can be located and managed to maximise environmental benefits. The overall conclusion is that substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by the use of fertilisers and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils? which also leads to increased soil fertility. Nutrient leaching could be reduced by using energy crop cultivations as buffer strips along open streams and wind erosion could be reduced by using Salix plantations as shelter belts. Cultivation of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal waste, such as waste water, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge. Furthermore, the content of heavy metals in the soil can be reduced through Salix cultivation. The biodiversity is estimated to be almost unchanged, or slightly increased in open farmland. These environmental benefits, which could be achieved on up to 60% of current Swedish arable land and last for 25 years or more, will increase the value of the energy crops. The economic value of these benefits is calculated in Part II of the analysis, which is presented in a second paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hedgerows, rows of trees or shrubs enclosing or separating fields, are man made. They are part of rural landscapes and should not be studied without considering the farming systems and the rural society as a whole. Their species composition depends on the history of the countryside, as well as current farming practices. Land use and boundary management play a major role in determining the floristic composition of hedgerows, and are strongly related to the grain size of the field's mosaic. Hedgerow networks, due to their rectilinear shape, and with their high degree of connection, enhance or interrupt many fluxes in the landscape. Hedgerows act as a corridor of movement and dispersal for many forest species, such as carabids, small mammals, and plants. On the other hand, hedgerows interrupt or slow down air fluxes and the propagules they carry. In the heterogeneous mosaic of fields and wooded patches, hedgerows often increase the functional connectivity of rural landscapes. The future of hedgerows depends on the changes of the rural society, which includes more and more nonfarmers. Hedgerows will be considered not only as a part of a productive area, but also as an element of a multifunctional landscape.

AB  - Abstract: Buffer strips on agricultural land have been shown to protect surface water quality by reducing erosion and diffuse pollution. They can also play a key role in nature conservation and flood risk mitigation as well as in the design of bioenergy landscapes resilient to changes in climate, environmental pressures from intensive agriculture and policy developments. Use of conservation buffers by farmers outside of designated schemes is limited to date, but the increasing demand for bioenergy and the combination of agricultural production with conservation calls for a much wider implementation. This paper reviews the biophysical knowledge on buffer functioning and associated ecosystem services. It describes how a three-zone buffer design, with arable fields buffered in combination by grassland, short rotation forestry (SRF) or coppice (SRC) and undisturbed vegetation along water courses, can be incorporated into farming landscapes as productive conservation elements and reflects on the potential for successful implementation. Land use plays a much greater role in determining catchment hydrology than soil type: shelterbelts or buffer strips have markedly higher infiltration capacity than arable or pasture land. Root architecture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants differs between species and is important for the extent of hydrological changes after establishment. Riparian buffers retain 30–99% of nitrate N and 20–100% of phosphorus from runoff and shallow groundwater. Buffers are also highly effective for pesticide removal and farmland biodiversity conservation with a high potential for low-input fuel, feed, or fibre production. Landscape amenities, sporting opportunities, and a display of land stewardship are additional benefits.

AB  - Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) such as oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfadimethoxine (SDT) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) may adversely impact human health and environmental quality. Understanding sorption and transport of VAs is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching surface or groundwater resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) affect soil properties that enhance removal of organic pollutants and thus may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (1) measure the sorption and retention of veterinary antibiotics to soils collected from three different soils series each planted to agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass buffer (GBS), and row crops (RC), and determine the soil physical and chemical properties governing antibiotic sorption to these soils; (2) investigate changes in VA sorption and retention to VBS and cropland soils in the presence of manure-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM); (3) and study and model VA transport through soil columns repacked with VBS and cropland soils in presence and absence of manure-derived DOM. Sorption experiment results show that OTC was strongly adsorbed by all soils and was not readily extractable, whereas SDT and SMZ sorption to soils were weak and therefore highly mobile in soils. The sorption isotherms for OTC and SMZ were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. Further investigation of solid-to-solution partition coefficients ( Kd ) revealed that vegetative management had a significant (P < 0.01) influence on SMZ sorption and followed the order AGF > GBS > RC, and for OTC sorption VBS > RC. Significant differences in Kd values for these VAs were also noted among the soil series studied. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Study of the two most contrasting soils revealed that increasing solution pH from 6.0 to 7.5 greatly reduced SMZ sorption to the Armstrong GBS soil, but little pH effect was observed for the Huntington GBS soil. Although the presence of DOM (150 mg L -1 C) had little effect on Freundlich model parameters, DOM resulted in slightly lower SMZ Kd values, presumably, due to competitive interactions between the VA and DOM for sorption sites. Transport study including 14 C-labeled SMZ or SMZ plus DOM (150 mg L-1 OC) and non-reactive tracer bromide was conducted in saturated columns packed with Huntington soil (silt loam) planted to AGF and RC. Bromide breakthrough curves were fitted with an equilibrium model within the CXTFIT software, whereas SMZ breakthrough was fitted with the HYDRUS-1D software using two-site and three-site models with linear or Freundlich sorption components. Results indicate that the three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component (3S2R-Freu-irrev model) best describes SMZ transport through the columns with model efficiencies of 0.998, 0.994, and 0.991 for AGF, AGF + DOM and cropland soils, respectively. Fitted sorption parameters such as Kd , Kf and N are in the same range of those obtained from equilibrium sorption experiments. DOM effects were not observed due to diluted DOM concentration. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.

AB  - One-half of a 35- by 250-m riparian buffer cropped in corn (Zea mays L.) was seeded with fine leaf fescue (Festuca spp.) and allowed to remain idle to determine water quality changes resulting from riparian buffer restoration. A corn control was also used in this paired watershed design located in Connecticut. Water, N, and P fluxes were determined for precipitation, overland now, and ground water. Also, an N mass balance was calculated. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) increased as ground water flowed through the restored buffer. Nitrate N (NO3-N) concentrations declined significantly but most (52%) of the decrease occurred within a 2.5-m wetland adjacent to the stream. An N mass balance for the 2.5-m strip indicated that denitrification only accounted for 1% of the N losses and plant uptake was from 7 to 13% of the N losses annually. Ground water was the dominant source of N to the buffer and also the dominant loss. Restoration of the riparian buffer decreased (p < 0.05) overland flow concentrations of TKN by 70%, NO3-N by 83%, TP by 73%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 92% as compared with the control. Restoration reduced (p < 0.05) NO3-N concentrations in ground water by 35% as compared with the control. Underestimated denitrification and dilution by upwelling ground water in the wetland area adjacent to the stream were believed to be primarily responsible for the decreasing NO3-N concentrations observed.

AB  - This paper summarises findings from the Pathogen Transmission Routes Research Program, describing pathogen pathways from farm animals to water bodies and measures that can reduce or prevent this transfer. Significant faecal contamination arises through the deposition of faeces by grazing animals directly into waterways in New Zealand. Bridging of streams intersected by farm raceways is an appropriate mitigation measure to prevent direct deposition during herd crossings, whilst fencing stream banks will prevent access from pasture into waterways by cattle that are characteristically attracted to water. Riparian buffer strips not only prevent cattle access to waterways, they also entrap microbes from cattle and other animals being washed down-slope towards the stream in surface runoff. Microbial water quality improvements can be realised by fencing stock from ephemeral streams, wetlands, seeps, and riparian paddocks that are prone to saturation. Soil type is a key factor in the transfer of faecal microbes to waterways. The avoidance of, or a reduction in, grazing and irrigation upon poorly drained soils characterised by high bypass flow and/or the generation of surface runoff, are expected to improve microbial water quality. Dairyshed wastewater should be irrigated onto land only when the water storage capacity of the soil will not be exceeded. This "deferred irrigation" can markedly reduce pollutant transfer to waterways, particularly that via subsurface drains and groundwater. Advanced pond systems provide excellent effluent quality and have particular application where soil type and/or climate are unfavourable for irrigation. Research needs are indicated to reduce faecal contamination of waters by livestock.

AB  - This review summarizes how conservation benefits are maximized when in-field and edge-of-field buffers are integrated with each other and with other conservation practices such as residue management and grade control structures. Buffers improve both surface and subsurface water quality. Soils under permanent buffer vegetation generally have higher organic carbon concentrations, higher infiltration capacities, and more active microbial populations than similar soils under annual cropping. Sediment can be trapped with rather narrow buffers, but extensive buffers are better at transforming dissolved pollutants. Buffers improve surface runoff water quality most efficiently when flows through them are slow, shallow, and diffuse. Vegetative barriers - narrow strips of dense, erect grass - can slow and spread concentrated runoff. Subsurface processing is best on shallow soils that provide increased hydrologic contact between the ground water plume and buffer vegetation. Vegetated ditches and constructed wetlands can act as ‘after-field’ conservation buffers, processing pollutants that escape from fields. For these buffers to function efficiently, it is critical that in-field and edge-of-field practices limit peak runoff rate and sediment yield in order to maximize contact time with buffer vegetation and minimize the need for cleanout excavation that destroys vegetation and its processing capacity.

AB  - Anthropogenic modification of the countryside has resulted in much of the landscape consisting of fragments of once continuous habitat. Increasing habitat connectivity at the landscape-scale has a vital role to play in the conservation of species restricted to such remnant patches, especially as species may attempt to track zones of habitat that satisfy their niche requirements as the climate changes. Conservation policies and management strategies frequently advocate corridor creation as one approach to restore connectivity and to facilitate species movements through the landscape. Here we examine the utility of hedgerows as corridors between woodland habitat patches using rigorous systematic review methodology. Systematic searching yielded 26 studies which satisfied the review inclusion criteria. The empirical evidence currently available is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of hedgerow corridors as a conservation tool to promote the population viability of woodland fauna. However, the studies did provide anecdotal evidence of positive local population effects and indicated that some species use hedgerows as movement conduits. More replicated and controlled field investigations or long-term monitoring are required in order to allow practitioners and policy makers to make better informed decisions about hedgerow corridor creation and preservation. The benefits of such corridors in regard to increasing habitat connectivity remain equivocal, and the role of corridors in mitigating the effects of climate change at the landscape-scale is even less well understood. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Windbreaks and shelterbelts are often used in agriculture to modify crop environments, because it is widely believed that plant survival, growth and reproduction are improved above that which would be expected of unsheltered plants. A substantial part of the effect of shelter has been ascribed to a beneficial change in the way in which sheltered plants use water, particularly during periods when water is greatly limited. We have reviewed the concept of plant water-use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of carbon gained to water lost through the stomata and have tried to explain how shelter might influence WUE due to changes in the microclimate around the plants in its lee. Because the microclimate around shelters is so complex, we have relied heavily on conceptual models, in particular the idea that shelter might "decouple" plants from their atmospheric environment. It seems certain that the reduction in turbulent transfer contributes to improved water-use efficiency in shelter under many situations; however, this improvement cannot be assumed to hold for all shelter conditions. © 1988.

AB  - Honey bee populations have experienced serious losses in Europe and North America. These losses highlight the potential risk to our agricultural systems that could result from loss of pollination. These losses include direct economic repercussions to multiple industries (beekeeping, fruit, vegetable, forage seed, oil seed and biofuel crops), and corresponding threats to human nutrition. Reasons for the losses are varied but include a lack of diverse nectar and pollen resources within intensively farmed agricultural landscapes. Focusing primarily on Europe and the USA, we review the potential approaches to provide and maintain diverse floral resources for honey bees, giving particular consideration to herbaceous plants ("forbs"). These approaches include the cultivation and maintenance of "bee pastures", consisting of diverse native or non-native flower-rich plantings maintained in fallow areas, field margins, and conservation buffer strips to sustain bee populations, support honey bee health, and aid beekeeping activities. Within this review we examine specific governmental policy initiatives to support these efforts in the USA and Europe.

AB  - Summary: Towards Flexible Coexistence Regulations for GM crops in the EUThe European Union (EU) is currently facing a challenge that might unnecessarily hamper the adoption of GM crops: regulating the coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops. Member states are currently implementing or developing both ex ante coexistence regulations and ex post liability schemes to ensure that both GM and non-GM crops can be cultivated in the EU. In this article, we explore in detail how national and/or regional policymakers can build in a certain degree of flexibility in ex ante coexistence regulations in order to reduce the regulatory burden on certain agricultural options and avoid jeopardising the economic incentives for coexistence. We use the example of GM maize as a case study, being the only GM crop planted over a significant area in the EU. We conclude that flexibility could be integrated into regulations at different levels: (i) at the regulatory level by relaxing some of the regulatory rigidity in ex ante regulations; (ii) at the farm level by allowing the substitution of isolation distances by pollen barriers; and (iii) at the national/regional level through plural coexistence measures, consistent with heterogeneity of farming in the EU. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract: In their recent article in this journal, discuss the effects of alternative spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) in the context of the EU regulatory framework. We retain from that small pollen barriers should be considered as a possible regulatory option in all identifiable situations in which they are as effective as large isolation distances. This idea is in accordance with the proportionality principle of the 2003 EC Recommendation. But further analysis of how consumer choice and consumer welfare are affected should be conducted before supporting the idea that SEACERs should be flexible, that is that GMO farmers should always have the option of paying their non-GMO neighbours to implement the SEACERs in their own fields. We reject the authors’ argument that pollen barriers are necessarily more easily negotiable among neighbours (more “flexible”) than are isolation distances. We contest the relation of proportionality to the size of market signals for IP products. We contest the idea of shifting coexistence regulation from ex ante to ex post. We believe that any economic analysis of coexistence measures should include their welfare effects on consumers as well as on producers.

AB  - Member states in the European Union (EU) implemented both ex ante coexistence regulations and ex post liability schemes to ensure that genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops can be cultivated side by side without excluding any agricultural option. Although proportionate coexistence is best achieved if regulated in a flexible manner, most implemented coexistence regulations merely rely on rigid measures. Flexible coexistence regulations, however, would reduce the regulatory burden on certain agricultural options and avoid jeopardizing economic incentives for coexistence. Flexibility can be integrated at: (i) the regulatory level by relaxing the rigidity of coexistence measures in ex ante regulations, yet without offsetting incentives to implement coexistence measures; (ii) the farm level by recommending the use of pollen barriers instead of large and fixed isolation distances; and (iii) the national/regional level by allowing diversified coexistence measures, which are adapted to the heterogeneity of farming in the EU. Owing to difficulties of implementation, the adoption of flexible and proportionate coexistence regulations will inevitably entail challenges. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The ongoing discussion on the co-existence between genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops becomes more important in the European Union (EU). With the recent inscription of 17 GM maize varieties in the common EU catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species, the acreage of transgenic maize for market purposes is expected to increase in some European countries. In the EU, specific tolerance thresholds have been established for the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GM material in non-GM produce, and member states are elaborating legal frames to cope with co-existence. As maize is a cross-pollinated crop relying on wind for the dispersal of its pollen, technical management measures will be imposed to reduce cross-fertilization between transgenic and non-transgenic maize. Various biological, physical and analytical parameters have been identified to play a role in the study of cross-fertilization in maize. This variability may hamper the comparison between research results and may complicate the definition of appropriate isolation distances and/or pollen barriers in order to limit out-crossing. The present review addresses these parameters and proposes containment measures in order to not exceed the legal labeling thresholds in maize.

AB  - In 2013, an opportunity arose in England to develop an agri-environment package for wild pollinators, as part of the new Countryside Stewardship scheme launched in 2015. It can be understood as a 'policy window', a rare and time-limited opportunity to change policy, supported by a narrative about pollinator decline and widely supported mitigating actions. An agri-environment package is a bundle of management options that together supply sufficient resources to support a target group of species. This paper documents information that was available at the time to develop such a package for wild pollinators. Four questions needed answering: (1) Which pollinator species should be targeted? (2) Which resources limit these species in farmland? (3) Which management options provide these resources? (4) What area of each option is needed to support populations of the target species? Focussing on wild bees, we provide tentative answers that were used to inform development of the package. There is strong evidence that floral resources can limit wild bee populations, and several sources of evidence identify a set of agri-environment options that provide flowers and other resources for pollinators. The final question could only be answered for floral resources, with a wide range of uncertainty. We show that the areas of some floral resource options in the basic Wild Pollinator and Farmland Wildlife Package (2% flower-rich habitat and 1 km flowering hedgerow), are sufficient to supply a set of six common pollinator species with enough pollen to feed their larvae at lowest estimates, using minimum values for estimated parameters where a range was available. We identify key sources of uncertainty, and stress the importance of keeping the Package flexible, so it can be revised as new evidence emerges about how to achieve the policy aim of supporting pollinators on farmland. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) on 33 Virginia [USA] farms were visited and observed over a 13-month period to evaluate their long-term effectiveness for water quality improvement. Operational problems observed during the site visits were documented and design or maintenance procedures to alleviate the problems were evaluated. Of the VFS observed, 36% were judged to be totally ineffective, were no longer in existence, or were simply extensions of pastures-although all were or had been part of the state cost-share program. Most of the sites visited had topographic limitations which severely limited VFS performance. Accumulation of surface runoff in natural drainageways within fields before it reached the VFS was the most common and critical problem. Runoff from the drainageways crossed the VFS in a few narrow areas, totally inundating the filters and rendering them ineffective for sediment and nutrient reduction. This situation is difficult to control and VFS are probably not appropriate for fields with extensive internal drainageways unless the VFS extend up into the fields and parallel the drainageways forming wide grassed waterways. Vegetative filter strips were judged to be beneficial even when they could not filter sediment and nutrients from runoff because they provided localized erosion protection in critical areas along streambanks. They did not act as filters, however, and should therefore be referred to as vegetative buffer strips or critical area plantings.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) as an effective best management practice for the control of some nonpoint source pollutants were studied. Field experiments, designed to investigate the transport of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphate from areas of confined livestock activity, as influenced by flow characteristics and filter strip length, were conducted. Results indicated that VFS are effective for the removal of sediment and other suspended solids contained in surface runoff from feedlots if runoff is shallow and uniform; effectiveness of VFS for sediment removal decreases with time as sediment accumulates within the filters; total nitrogen and phosphorus are not removed as effectively as sediment; and soluble nitrogen and phosphorus are not removed effectively.

AB  - Recommending the use of "grass buffer strips" to control diffuse P transfer has become well accepted among extension advisors, agricultural consultants, planners, and other practitioners that influence the structure of the agricultural landscape. These grassed areas are put in place to capture the P contained in runoff from source fields. They are designed to function as a filter and a sediment trap although it is often unclear what the long-term disposition of the accumulated P may be. The objective of this work was to determine if the available scientific literature justifies the continued recommendation of this approach in the prevention of phosphorus movement from agricultural soils to surface waters. We employed a theoretical analysis of the mechanisms of the buffering effect and the specific behaviour of phosphorus in typical grass buffer strips to establish the critical set of literature applicable to this question. An adequate body of literature exists describing many aspects of P dynamics and the short-term functioning of grass buffer strips over their seasonal cycles. Despite variable results in a diversity of landscape contexts, overall, the use of grass buffer strips appears to provide useful short-term functions in the reduction of P transport to surface waters. Long-term benefits remain questionable given the relatively short-term use of this approach in P reduction and the lack of long-term experimental results, but this current lack of data is not sufficient to deter the continued incorporation of grass buffer strips in the landscape of French agricultural. Additionally, a more comprehensive conceptual model integrating the short-term functioning of grass buffer strips with seasonal cycles and the long-term consequences of cumulative storage emerged from our synthesis.

AB  - The success of buffer installation initiatives and programs to reduce nonpoint source pollution of streams on agricultural lands will depend the ability of local planners to locate and design buffers for specific circumstances with substantial and predictable results. Current predictive capabilities are inadequate, and major sources of uncertainty remain. An assessment of these uncertainties cautions that there is greater risk of overestimating buffer impact than underestimating it. Priorities for future research are proposed that will lead more quickly to major advances in predictive capabilities. Highest priority is given for work on the surface runoff filtration function, which is almost universally important to the amount of pollution reduction expected from buffer installation and for which there remain major sources of uncertainty for predicting level of impact. Foremost uncertainties surround the extent and consequences of runoff flow concentration and pollutant accumulation. Other buffer functions, including filtration of groundwater nitrate and stabilization of channel erosion sources of sediments, may be important in some regions. However, uncertainty surrounds our ability to identify and quantify the extent of site conditions where buffer installation can substantially reduce stream pollution in these ways. Deficiencies in predictive models reflect gaps in experimental information as well as technology to account for spatial heterogeneity of pollutant sources, pathways, and buffer capabilities across watersheds. Since completion of a comprehensive watershed-scale buffer model is probably far off, immediate needs call for simpler techniques to gage the probable impacts of buffer installation at local scales.

AB  - Conservation buffers, such as filter strips and riparian forest buffers, are widely prescribed to improve and protect water quality in agricultural landscapes. These buffers intercept field runoff and retain some of its pollutant load before it reaches a waterway. A buffer typically is designed to have uniform width along a field margin and to intercept runoff that flows uniformly to it. However, spatial analysis of field conditions and runoff patterns indicate that more runoff is likely to flow to some locations along a field margin than to others which can substantially limit a buffer's effectiveness. We propose that precision conservation, the use of precision spatial information, technologies, and procedures to implement conservation practices, can be used to improve the design of buffers and ensure their effectiveness. Precision conservation can integrate detailed landscape data with mathematical models in a geographic information system. We can then analyze spatial patterns of runoff and design variable-width buffers that precisely match the needs of every location along a waterway. Greater cost of precision conservation is offset partly by greater water-quality benefit from each acre of buffer. Many of the required data sources and modeling components already exist, substantial improvements are possible that can produce even greater conservation efficiency.

AB  - The interface found where rivers meet terrestrial systems is an ecotone that has a profound influence on the movement of water and waterborne contaminants. Maintaining or restoring ecotone functions and characteristics such as natural near stream vegetation and channel morphology are important means to safeguard water quality in agricultural landscapes. A riparian buffer zone of 20 to 30 m width can remove up to 100% of incoming nitrate. Denitrification is the major pathway of removal and rates depend on nitrate loadings, carbon availability, and hydrology. Denitrification occurs throughout the year as long as subsurface hydrology is intact, whereas plant uptake of nitrogen is limited to seasonal removal. Nitrate removal is favored in forested areas with subsurface flow and is less in grassed areas with surface flow. The balance between surface and subsurface flows and the redox conditions that result are critical to nitrate removal in riparian ecotones. Surface retention of nutrients and sediment is a function of slope length and gradient, vegetation density, and flow rates. Plant communities play a major role in nitrogen cycling by acting as a source of carbon for denitrifying bacteria, direct uptake of nutrients, and creating oxidized rhizospheres where nitrification can occur. Restoration of riparian zones requires knowledge of the area's hydrology and ecology, as well as clear goals for the project. Restoration of riparian zones for water quality improvement may provide higher economic benefits than allocating the same land to crops. While it is possible to restore the functions of natural floodplain systems, existing restoration techniques are in their infancy and success cannot be guaranteed, especially given the extent of hydrological modification that has occurred in most developed countries.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy and food, climate change and land availability are causing concerns over land-use conflicts within the "food-energy-environment trilemma". The HEDGE-BIOMASS project addresses the promotion of a new perennial linear landscape element: bioenergy buffers. Bioenergy buffer strips (BBS) are narrow arable field margins and buffer strips along waterways converted to warm-season grasses and short-rotation woody crops for bioenergy applications. Within the HEDGE-BIOMASS project, an extensive review of scientific literature has been performed to identify the state of the art knowledge on perennial biomass crops with particular reference to their capacity to supply ecological services and to define the most suitable biomass supply chain management design. Implementing new bioenergy buffers could significantly enhance the pollination service and natural enemy control in arable crops by neighbouring presence of beneficial organisms on bioenergy buffer. A positive interaction between crop management and species richness was found in bioenergy crops for a long list of taxa. With regards to miscanthus and switchgrass, the deep-rooting system proved to be the main factor for improving water/nutrient use efficiency. Herbaceous BBS can promote positive alterations of C cycling pathways in terms of increased belowground carbon (C) allocation and belowground fine root biomass. Short-rotation woody crops in BBS, instead, increase the litter C and nitrogen (N) input to soil and start to act as net C sink few years after establishment. Several positive experiences have been reported in literature on removal efficiency of non-point source agricultural pollutants coming from adjacent agricultural fields. A 5-10 m wide herbaceous BBS can efficiently mitigate sediment, N and total phosphorus (P) runoff. However, if BBS are placed on flatland regions with slow runoff flow the risk of P delivery from buffers can be increased due to dissolved P remobilization from standing aboveground litter mediated by microbial processes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no data regarding denitrification processes in shallow groundwaters under BBS. Moreover, soil N-2/N2O emission dynamics and annual N2O budget in BBS remain uncertain. Nevertheless, it has been reported that BBS can significantly reduce nitrate leaching compared with surrounding row-cropping systems from the second growing season. Regarding biomass yield achieved on BBS it emerged that no data are available for switchgrass and miscanthus while extensive literature is available for woody crops. We can assume that biomass yields of herbaceous buffers are similar to those reported for large scale cultivations because efficient mechanisms of nutrients up-take, trapping, filtration and infiltration occur usually in BBS. Warm-season grasses presented on average the highest values of greenhouse gas savings, particularly when biomass is used for electricity production by gasification. The width of the bioenergy buffer strip is a fundamental element to design effective systems. Unfortunately, from the logistic point of view, biomass harvesting and collection is limited by the linear arrangement of biomass crops along arable field margins. As a consequence of this restricted operating space, the intra-and extra-farm fragmentation of logisticoperations seems to be the main critical step of BBS management compared to the traditional large-scale bioenergy cultivation scenario. Within the framework of HEDGE-BIOMASS project a comprehensive assessment of ecological services provided by bioenergy buffers is being carried out. Furthermore, a multicriteria spatial analysis combining GIS, Life Cycle Assessment and SWAT model, will be performed to at landscape level propose new bioenergy production scenarios along field margins. This research will develop an energy production strategy that offer an opportunity to rethink how and where bioenergy feedstocks can be sustainably produced and to optimize the trade-offs between the delivery of multiple ecological services and farmer ncomes within limited land resources.

AB  - Hedgerows originated and coexist with agriculture. Their internal structure and species diversity vary widely with origin (planted, spontaneous, or remnant), farming practices in adjacent fields, and the refined art of hedgerow management. Most hedgerow species are forest-edge species, and apparently none is limited to hedgerows. Wide hedgerows composed of trees and shrubs appear to function as corridors for movement of many plants and animals across a landscape. The reduction of crop loss, by dampening pest population fluctuations with hedgerow predators, remains a hypothesis for study. Field microclimate downwind of a hedgerow is modified about 16 times the hedgerow height (h) for evaporation, and approximately 28 h for wind speed. A turbulent wind pattern with harsher microclimate is present at 6-8 h if a second hedgerow is nearby downwind. Zones of higher crop productivity at 3- to 6-h downwind, and 2- to 6-h upwind of a second hedgerow may be expected. Overall, we expect little short-term difference in farm-field production with or without hedgerows. Evidence suggests that hedgerow networks, and especially their mesh size (of fields), exert a major control on many major landscape fluxes. Such fluxes include animal populations, wind speed, evapotranspiration and soil desiccation, soil erosion and nutrient runoff, species movement along network lines, and movement of field species across the network. In a relatively short period, the hedgerow ecosystem, with no unique species, has attained a metastable equilibrium, which is regulated by enormous human inputs. More than 20 economic roles of hedgerows are pinpointed. The roles, providing resources and protection of resources, are poorly known quantitatively. We conclude that hedgerows perform diverse functions for society and the farmer that are both economically and ecologically significant. © 1984 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

AB  - A recently published study concluded that 6 m wide Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) field margins had positive benefits for Orthoptera in southern England, particularly in landscapes with small (5 ha) and intermediate (9 ha) field sizes. However, research in eastern England, where farmland management can be extremely intensive (e.g. high nitrogen fertiliser input) and field sizes are large, provides evidence that 6 m margins do not necessarily lead to higher Orthoptera densities than intensively managed farmland habitats such as arable fields or improved, fertilised pastures. The low abundance of grasshoppers in field margins in Essex may be partially explained by the annual cutting of the margins in summer (August) leading to direct mortality of adult grasshoppers and dispersal of individuals from the short, cut vegetation (< 10 cm in height) to surrounding tall grassland due to their need for shelter from predation and inclement weather. Shelter from excessively high microclimatic temperatures is also provided by taller vegetation (10-20 cm in height). Botanical composition of the swards may also be important, a predominance of fine-leaved grass species such as Festuca rubra leads to a 'warm' (but not too hot) microclimate favourable for grasshopper basking and reproduction, whereas fertilised swards composed entirely of Lolium perenne are characterised by tall and dense swards (> 20 cm in height) with a 'cold' microclimate unsuitable for sustained grasshopper activities.

AB  - Agroforestry practices and the policies influencing development and adoption within the United States are reviewed. Agroforestry is defined as intensive land-management systems that optimize the benefits from biological interactions created when trees and/or shrubs are deliberately combined with crops and/or livestock'. The five agroforestry systems identified as having importance in the US are tree-agronomic crop systems (alley cropping and intercropping), riparian vegetative buffer strip systems, tree-animal systems (silvopasturing), forest/speciality crop systems (forest farming) and windbreak systems (shelterbelts). A lack of federal policy relating specifically to agroforestry exists. If agroforestry is to achieve its full potential in the United States, adequate financial, institutional and technical support for its development must be provided.

AB  - Planting a shelterbelt is the only option open to some New Zealand livestock farmers for reducing the adverse effects of wind. For most purposes, the best shelterbelt is one which has between 40 and 60% porosity that is distributed evenly throughout its length and height and protects the maximum area of pasture from the wind. Under cold conditions shelter has been shown to improve pasture yield, and growth rate, ovulation rate, and wool growth rate in cattle and sheep, and to reduce lamb mortality and abortions that are induced by hypothermia. Providing shelter from the sun during hot conditions has been shown to improve milk yield, milkfat yield, freedom from mastitis, and conception rates in dairy cattle, and growth rate in fattening cattle. -fron Author

AB  - 1. Sown wildflower strips are increasingly being established in European countries within agri-environmental schemes to enhance biodiversity, especially in intensively used agricultural areas.2. The regulations vary between countries regarding the seed mixture, intensity of management and period of time over which subsidies are given. Insects in particular are intended to benefit from these schemes.3. This review treats studies of insect diversity and abundance in sown wildflower strips. Schemes on wildflower strips in several countries in Central and Northern Europe are compared.4. In a significant majority of studies, sown wildflower strips support higher insect abundances and diversity than cropped habitats. In general, numbers and diversity also tend to be higher than in other margin types such as sown grass margins and natural regeneration, but pollen- and nectar-rich flower mixtures may outperform them.5. Common species are the main beneficiaries of the establishment of wildflower strips, although some studies point out the presence of rare or declining insect species.6. Insect groups respond differently to particular characteristics of the strips. Flower abundance, seed mixture, vegetation structure, management, age and landscape have been identified as factors influencing insect abundance and diversity.7. Future work should address under-represented comparisons, such as with pollen- and nectar-rich seed mixes, and neglected groups, in particular parasitoids. Nevertheless, sown wildflower strips can already be seen as a beneficial measure to enhance insect diversity. This is especially the case, where schemes for sown strips vary within a region to favour different species groups.

AB  - The control of diffuse pollution is one of the major issues affecting the agricultural landscape. Policies of land use management are now being implemented as a means of improving water quality. The potential success of such policies is difficult to determine owing to the complex nature of the processes controlling the transport of diffuse pollutants such as nitrate, phosphorus and sediment. The use of buffer zones alongside water bodies in the agricultural landscape may offer a greater opportunity both for protecting the water and for increasing the habitat and amenity value of the landscape. The potential value of buffer zones in terms of water quality is dependent on landscape type and suitable design. The design of these features needs to consider the hydrology of both the buffer zone and of the landscape as a whole. In landscapes where the hydrology has been altered, additional measures may be required to establish suitable hydrological conditions. The implementation of a strategy of diffuse pollution control therefore needs to be approached on a landscape basis taking into account the nature of pollutant pathways and areas of high pollution risk.

AB  - The problem of nitrogen pollution in European surface- and groundwaters has become a focus of recent European and Scandinavian directives, with legislation calling for a 50% reduction of N losses by the years 1995 and 2000, respectively. This paper provides a conceptual framework upon which management strategies to reduce losses of diffuse nitrogen pollution to surface waters may be based. The control of nitrogen pollution may take place through an increase in the complexity of the landscape, not throughout the catchment area, but rather in specific zones, the river corridor in particular. Within river corridors, riparian areas have been recognized globally for their value as nutrient removal "buffer systems". Studies have identified vegetation uptake and microbial denitrification as the primary mechanisms responsible for N removal in these systems. For these processes to function optimally on an annual basis, both vegetation and water regime must be managed. The establishmentand management of riparian bufferzones in suitable places within river corridors, will provide a stable and sustainable water-protection function. This will complement future nitrogen input control strategies, needed for both the long-term protection of groundwater and surface waters in Europe as a whole, and for the proposed 50% reduction in nitrogen loading to the Baltic and North Sea coastal waters by the turn of the century.

AB  - In this review, we discuss the value of hedgerows as bird habitat in lowland-farming landscapes to provide a background against which decisions concerning hedgerow management might be evaluated. The two most important factors positively associated with species richness and abundance of breeding birds in hedgerows are hedge size (height/width/volume) and the presence/abundance of trees. The provision of cover and the botanical and structural complexity of the vegetation are also important. However, large hedges do not suit all species; birds tend to prefer hedgerow types which most closely resemble their usual non-hedgerow breeding habitat. The value of hedgerows to birds can be increased by combining them with other features such as headlands (for game birds), verges, wildflower strips, game and wild-bird cover and well-vegetated banks and ditches. The presence of well-grown, dead or decaying trees is beneficial to many species, providing nest holes, foraging sites and perches. Increasing the structural complexity of a hedgerow and its associated habitat may also reduce the incidence of predation. Hedgerows also provide physical shelter and roost sites and are an important source of winter food supplies, especially berries and other fruits. Some bird species, usually those whose primary habitat is woodland, live mainly within the hedgerow itself, whereas others are more dependent on the surrounding landscape to a greater or lesser extent. However, even the presence of woodland bird species is influenced by the availability and characteristics of alternative habitats in the surroundings and therefore hedgerows and their bird populations do not function as isolated patches. As linear landscape elements, hedgerows also provide safe cover for both local and larger-scale movements and may facilitate access to resources or habitat which might otherwise be too risky or too remote for birds to use or colonise. A number of recommendations for improving hedgerow habitat for birds are reiterated from an extensive literature and include combining hedgerows with other semi-natural habitat, providing a variety of structural types, maintaining good cover in the hedge-base, e.g. by excluding stock and herbicide, and avoiding excessive cutting. However, good hedgerow management has costs and is unlikely to be applied widely in the absence of national policy and funding. © 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Predicting the overall effect of woody borders on insect assemblages in agricultural landscapes is difficult because the effects that they have been hypothesized to have are numerous, and often conflicting. Management decisions are further complicated because the aims of insect conservation and agricultural production may often conflict. Results of four studies carried out on insects in alfalfa fields using different methods are discussed. The results of these studies suggest that woody borders can increase insect richness without a cost to agricultural production.

AB  - As demand for energy increases in the United States, alternative energy sources are being sought both domestically and abroad. Biofuels have been promoted as a major source of alternative energy, but sustainable supply of biomass still remains a major challenge. Agroforestry offers a potential way to integrate perennial woody bioenergy crops with traditional agricultural crops to satisfy energy demands without sacrificing food production in the North Central Region of the United States. We suggest shelterbelts, alley cropping and working riparian buffer strips as ideal candidates for biomass production in agroforestry settings in this region. In addition to satisfying domestic energy demands, these systems could also potentially increase water quality, sequester carbon, improve aesthetics, and provide critical wildlife habitat. However, obstacles to implementing agroforestry systems for biomass production, such as a competitive price structure and stable markets, must be overcome before large-scale adoption by landowners. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined the responses of pest and beneficial arthropods to plant diversification in ephemeral cropping habitats. Cruciferous crops, mainly cabbage and broccoli, are probably the most studied plants with respect to evaluating the impact of plant mixtures on insect population dynamics. This review examines the mechanisms influencing arthropod responses to floral diversification, specifically focusing on cruciferous crops. In many instances, mechanisms accounting for herbivores and natural enemy responses to plant mixtures are not thoroughly tested. Biological parameters of herbivores impacted by crop diversification were mainly related to the behavior of the insects studied. Mechanisms accounting for herbivore responses to plant mixtures include reduced colonization, reduced adult tenure time in the marketable crop, and oviposition interference. Tactics used for choosing companion plants, and the future perspective for mixed-crucifer crops usage are discussed. Manipulative studies involving cruciferous crops provide some evidence that habitat manipulation techniques (e.g., intercropping, undersown nonhost plants, vegetation borders) impact crop growth. However, the indirect role habitat manipulation plays in the population dynamics of insect pests and natural enemies still remains unclear in many systems. Quantitative data are needed to determine the level of change in plant quality brought about by companion planting that alters arthropod behavior. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eutrophication of surface waters accelerated by nutrient runoff from agriculture is a growing concern in developed countries. Controlling the loss of phosphorus is complicated, among other things, due to its intertemporal nature. Phosphorus fertilisation affects crop yields and phosphorus losses mainly via the potentially plant available of soil phosphorus reserves whose development is very slow. Hence, both privately and socially optimal choices of phosphorus are results of a dynamic decision making process. On the other hand, phosphorus loss is comprised of various phosphorus forms, differing in their contribution to eutrophication and in their sensitivity towards various phosphorus control measures. These forms can be roughly divided into particulate phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus. The former can be controlled mainly by controlling the soil erosion, the latter by controlling the potentially plant available soil phosphorus reserves. In this study, we solve analytically the privately and socially optimal steady state fertilisation levels and vegetative filter strip allocations, and design and analyse alternative instruments to sustain these allocations. We conduct an empirical application for an agricultural area of 37 parcels of one hectare, varying in their slopes and shapes. We find that the first-best taxes can be equivalently base on fertilisation or on soil phosphorus, but basing them directly on soil phosphorus might reduce the information burden of the regulator. We also find that the vegetative filter strip allocations are strongly differentiated, and that the second-best vegetative filter strip subsidies can be relatively easily be adjusted to sustain almost the first-best allocations.

AB  - Field shelterbelts increase yields of field and forage crops throughout the world. The increases are due to reduced wind erosion, improved microclimate, snow retention and reduced crop damage by high winds. Crops differ in their responsiveness to shelter. Of the field and forage crops tested, winter wheat, barley, rye, millet, alfalfa and hay (mixed grasses and legumes) appear to be highly responsive to protection, while spring wheat, oats and corn respond to a lesser degree. Shelterbelt height and longevity, field width and shelterbelt orientation are major considerations in determining the effect of shelterbelts on crop yields. Precipitation has an effect on the percentage yield increase reported. Generally, percentage yield increases due to shelterbelts have been higher in drier regions or in drier years. By proper shelterbelt design and maintenance and the use of responsiveness crops, shelterbelt benefits to crop yields can be optimized. © 1988.

AB  - Erosion is one of the main threats to soils and is associated with numerous environmental and economic impacts. At the landscape scale, soil redistribution patterns induced by water and tillage erosion are complex, and landscape structures play an important role in their spatial distribution. In this study, soil redistribution patterns, generated by both water and tillage erosion, were estimated in the vicinity of hedges in an agricultural landscape. Two complementary methods were employed to estimate soil redistribution from 1960 to 2010: Cs-137 conversion models and a spatially distributed soil erosion model (LandSoil model). Both methods determined that hedges affected soil redistribution patterns, which led to soil deposition or limited soil erosion uphill from hedges, even though soil erosion rates were consistently higher than soil deposition rates. Depending on the method, mean soil redistribution rates ranged from -15.9 to -4.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) for all sampling points, from -4.8 to 22 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in positions uphill from hedges and from -4.8 to -11.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in positions located downhill from hedges. The impact of tillage on soil redistribution in the vicinity of hedges was found to be higher than that of water processes because 87% of net soil redistribution was linked to tillage. This confirmed the importance of including landscape structure and working at the landscape scale rather than at the plot scale to better estimate soil redistribution in agricultural areas.

AB  - Annual crop fields typically are simple habitats dominated by a few plant species where pesticides play a major role in managing weed and insect infestations. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential to reduce reliance on pesticides by manipulating plant species and communities to benefit natural enemies of insects and weeds. Such efforts aim to enhance natural enemy impact by providing appropriate food, shelter, and hosts, and efforts typically are accomplished by manipulation of plant species, populations, or communities. Habitat management is generally viewed as an important factor in maintaining stable insect and natural enemy populations in agricultural systems and may have a similar function in increasing weed seed predation. Crop and noncrop habitats provide resources to natural enemies either directly through floral nectar and Pollen, indirectly by increased host or prey availability, or through emergent properties of the habitat such as by moderating the microclimate. These critical resources for natural enemies can be provided in agricultural ecosystems at several scales: within fields, at field margins, or as a component of the larger landscape. Because individual natural enemy species may require quite specific resources at different times and spatial scales, not all attempts to manipulate habitat diversity are equally effective. We review the role of plant resources, including weeds, in supporting natural enemy communities and provide case studies of how varying plant diversity at different spatial scales can influence the effectiveness of biological control in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Many agroecosystems are unfavorable environments for natural enemies due to high levels of disturbance. Habitat management, a form of conservation biological control, is an ecologically based approach aimed at favoring natural enemies and enhancing biological control in agricultural systems. The goal of habitat management is to create a suitable ecological infrastructure within the agricultural landscape to provide resources such as food for adult natural enemies, alternative prey or hosts, and shelter from adverse conditions. These resources must be integrated into the landscape in a way that is spatially and temporally favorable to natural enemies and practical for producers to implement. The rapidly expanding literature on habitat management is reviewed with attention to practices for favoring predators and parasitoids, implementation of habitat management, and the contributions of modeling and ecological theory to this developing area of conservation biological control. The potential to integrate the goals of habitat management for natural enemies and nature conservation is discussed.

AB  - The Forschungsverbund Agrarökosysteme München (FAM) project identified a species spectrum of foliage-dwelling spiders characteristic for agro-ecosystems in Europe. These species could be recorded in all studied habitats (arable fields, grasslands, set-asides, field margins), though in differing densities. Spider species composition and richness is affected on different spatial scales: on a microhabitat, habitat and landscape level. The prominent factors supporting a richer spider community are structural and floral diversity of habitats, field margin width, reduction of mechanic disturbances, and margin density within the landscape. Higher abundance and species richness of spiders in arable land will improve pest control in fields, as shown by the predation studies of the FAM project. In intensely managed crops, field conditions are often too adverse for spiders, resulting in only low immigration rates and population densities. Organic farming practices provide a more suitable within-field environment for spiders and other predators, and consequently spider numbers and diversity in organic fields are much higher compared to conventionally managed fields. The combination of external field management (set-asides, field margins, hedgerows) and internal field management (intercropping, cover cropping, mulching) is therefore a mandatory strategy to fully exploit the beneficial effects of spiders. Many management practices have been explored and developed to increase arthropod predator density and diversity in agro-ecosystems to utilize the beneficial predation impact of natural enemies such as spiders, a research goal also pursued in the FAM project. Suggested successful approaches range from the scale of microhabitat manipulations to the habitat and the landscape. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The structural complexity of habitats has been espoused as an important factor influencing natural-enemy abundance and food-web dynamics in invertebrate-based communities, but a rigorous synthesis of published studies has not heretofore been conducted. We performed a meta-analytical synthesis of the density response of natural enemies (invertebrate predators and parasitoids) to experimental increases and decreases in the structural complexity of their habitats using data from 43 published studies, reporting 62 independent taxa. Studies varied in structural complexity at two spatial scales (habitat and within-plant architecture) and comprised a diverse array of natural-enemy taxa (natural-enemy assemblage at large, the entire spider assemblage, hunting spiders, web-building spiders, mites, hemipterans, coccinellid beetles, carabid beetles, ants, and parasitoids). For all taxa combined, increasing habitat structure resulted in a large and significant increase in natural enemy abundance. Similarly, decreasing habitat structure significantly diminished natural enemy abundance. Separate meta-analyses at two spatial scales (habitat and within-plant architecture) found that increasing habitat complexity resulted in significant increases in abundance. In particular, manipulating levels of detritus at the habitat spatial scale had the strongest effect on natural enemy abundance. In general, most guilds of natural enemies were significantly affected when the structural complexity of the habitat was altered. Seven of nine natural enemy guilds were more abundant under conditions of increased habitat complexity, with hunting spiders and web-building spiders showing the strongest response followed by hemipterans, mites, and parasitoids. Spiders in particular were negatively affected when habitat structure was simplified. The mechanisms underlying the accumulation of natural enemies in complex-structured habitats are poorly known. However, refuge from intraguild predation, more effective prey capture, and access to alternative resources (alternative prey, pollen, or nectar), are possible candidates. Our analysis was unable to confirm that predators aggregate in complex-structured habitats because prey (mostly herbivores) are more abundant there. The results of this meta-analysis support the view that basal resources mediate top-down impacts on herbivores, and provide encouragement that manipulations of habitat complexity can be made in agroecosystems that will enhance the effectiveness of the natural enemy complex for more effective pest suppression.

AB  - Nutrient retention mechanisms in riparian buffer strips are reviewed with emphasis on surface runoff and subsurface flows, the main pathways of exchanges between the stream and its surroundings. Unique physical and biogeochemical properties prevailing in these riparian ecotones dictate the flux of water, nutrients and other exogenous substances between the upland areas and the stream. Removal of nutrients from surface inflows is induced by deposition of sediment bound nutrients and exchange of dissolved nutrients with the soil/litter surface. Removal of nitrogen in subsurface flows can partly be explained by vegetation uptake, but the main mechanism for removal is usually denitrification. In channelized streams, the subsurface inflows have, in most cases, been altered to discharges via drainage tiles, with the exchange flows (water leaving and re-entering the open-channel via the stream bed and banks) being greatly decreased. Consequently, to improve nitrogen removal in these systems, these flows have to be intercepted or re-established either through restoration of the old stream valley or through managed structures in the buffer strips.

AB  - Sediment is a major agricultural pollutant threatening water quality. Vegetated buffers, including vegetative filter strips, riparian buffers, and grassed waterways, are best management practices (BMPs) installed in many areas to filter sediments front tailwaters, and deter sediment transport to water bodies. Along with reducing sediment transport, the filters also help trap sediment bound nutrients and pesticides. The objectives of this study were: (i) to review vegetated buffer efficacy on sediment trapping, and (ii) to develop statistical models to investigate the major factors influencing sediment trapping. A range of sediment trapping efficacies was found in a review of over 80 representative BMP experiments. A synthesis of the literature regarding the effects of vegetated buffers on sediment trapping is needed. The meta-analysis results based on the limited data showed that buffer width and slope are two major factors influencing BMPs efficacy of vegetated buffers on sediment trapping. Regardless of the area ratio of buffer to agricultural field, a 10 m buffer and a 9% slope optimized the sediment trapping capability of vegetated buffers.

AB  - Conservation buffers can have a tremendously positive impact on the ecological health of rural landscapes by reducing erosion, improving water quality, increasing biodiversity, and expanding wildlife habitats. Yet, in spite of our knowledge of their value, conservation buffers have not been fully embraced by landowners, or even by policy makers in the United States (US). In this critical review, we examine why conservation buffers remain underutilized in US agroecosystems. We examine the literature on the environmental benefits of buffers, the economic issues related to buffer adoption, and the importance of the aesthetic quality and design of buffers. We propose that many questions related to buffer design and management remain unanswered, and suggest a variety of areas in which future research is necessary to improve buffer functionality and adoption. The implications of this synthesis for designers, planners, scientists, policy makers, and citizens are discussed. Recommendations include: modifying policies to better reflect the preferences of landowners and society, studying buffer systems at the watershed scale using multidisciplinary approaches, and designing buffers that consider aesthetic preferences and regional variation.

Population declines have occurred for a number of mammalian species, sometimes drastically so, and changes in farming practice are believed to be significant contributory factors. 2. The major policy instruments for delivering environmental benefits on farmland are agri-environment schemes. These encourage farmers to adopt more environmentally sensitive farming practices to promote farmland biodiversity. Additionally, compulsory set-aside, which reduces agricultural surplus, could also have positive impacts on wildlife. In this paper we consider some of the putative benefits of agri-environment schemes and set-aside for mammals. 3. We review how establishment and management options within agri-environment schemes and set-aside might affect habitat resources for mammals. For example, conservation headlands increase plant and invertebrate resources within the crop edge for mammals such as wood mice. Grassy field margins can support communities of smaller mammals, and hedgerows may act as important commuting and hunting routes. Their potential will depend on factors such as seed mixtures used, timing and severity of cutting, and length of time they have been in place. 4. At a farm level, habitat heterogeneity may be increased through organic agriculture, which is supported by some agri-environment schemes. Studies suggest significant benefits to mammals, including wood mice and bats. However, it is increasingly recognized that effective conservation of farmland mammals must seek solutions at the landscape scale, addressing such issues as habitat connectivity between farms. One approach may be the better targeting of scheme agreements. 5. We suggest that agri-environment schemes and set-aside can contribute to the conservation of mammals on farmland. Recent policy changes are likely to have further positive impacts on farmland wildlife but appropriate mammal monitoring programmes must be developed rigorously to assess their effects.

AB  - The effects of soil and water conservation techniques (SWCTs) on annual runoff (Ra), runoff coefficients (RCa) and annual soil loss (SLa) at the plot scale have been extensively tested on field runoff plots in Europe and the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of these effects and the factors controlling the effectiveness of SWCTs is lacking. Especially the effectiveness of SWCT in reducing Ra is poorly understood. Therefore, an extensive literature review is presented that compiles the results of 101 earlier studies. In each of these studies, Ra and SLa was measured on field runoff plots where various SWCTs were tested. In total, 353 runoff plots (corresponding to 2093 plot-years of data) for 103 plot-measuring stations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean were considered. SWCTs include (1) crop and vegetation management (i.e. cover crops, mulching, grass buffer strips, strip cropping and exclosure), (2) soil management (i.e. no-tillage, reduced tillage, contour tillage, deep tillage, drainage and soil amendment) and (3) mechanical methods (i.e. terraces, contour bunds and geotextiles). Comparison of the frequency distributions of SLa rates on cropland without and with the application of SWCTs shows that the exceedance probability of tolerable SLa rates is ca. 20% lower when SWCT are applied. However, no notable effect of SWCTs on the frequency distribution of RCa is observed. For 224 runoff plots (corresponding to 1567 plot-year data), SWCT effectiveness in reducing Ra and/or SLa could be directly calculated by comparing measured Ra and/or SLa with values measured on a reference plot with conventional management. Crop and vegetation management techniques (i.e. buffer strips, mulching and cover crops) and mechanical techniques (i.e. geotextiles, contour bunds and terraces) are generally more effective than soil management techniques (i.e. no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage). Despite being generally less effective, no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage have received substantially more attention in the literature than the other SWCTs. Soil and water conservation techniques are generally less effective in reducing Ra than in reducing SLa, which is an important consideration in areas where water is a key resource and in regions susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, all SWCTs show a more consistent and effective reduction of both Ra and SLa with increasing Ra and SLa magnitude, which is attributed to the reduced influence of measurement uncertainties. Although some significantly negative correlations between SWCT effectiveness and plot slope length, slope gradient or annual precipitation were found, the importance of these factors in explaining the observed variability in effectiveness seems limited. Time-series analyses of Ra during multiple years of SWCT application strongly indicate that no-tillage and conservation tillage become less effective in reducing Ra over time. Such an effect is not observed for SLa.

AB  - In northwestern Europe, most agricultural landscapes are a mosaic of farmers' fields, semi-natural habitats, human infrastructures (e.g. roads) and occasional natural habitats. Within such landscapes, linear semi-natural habitats often d.-fine the edges of agricultural fields. In temperate, intensive agriculture, such field margin habitats, which historically had true agricultural functions, now are important refugia for biodiversity. In contrast to North America, northern Europe has few true wilderness areas and nature conservation increasingly has to be integrated into the managed farmed landscape. Thus margins have agricultural, environmental and conservation roles, though the relative importance of these is changing. As man-made habitats, field margins also have a cultural role as part of landscape heritage and some recreational roles. Nevertheless, field margins art, not specific or characteristic habitat types; they can contain a variety of plant communities in a variety of structures. These may range from aquatic elements, to ruderal and woodland communities, with combinations of them over small spatial scales. Studies demonstrate a variety of interactions between fields and their margins. Some margin flora may spread into crops, becoming field weeds. Margins also have a range of associated fauna, some of which may be pest species, while many are beneficial, either as crop pollinators or as pest predators. Agricultural operations, such as fertilizer and pesticide application, can have adverse effects on the margins via drift and disturbance. The biodiversity of:the margin may tie of particular importance for the maintenance of species at higher trophic levels,, notably farmland birds, at the landscape scale. Margins may also contribute to the sustainability of production, by enhancing beneficial species within crops and reducing pesticide use, though further research on the predictability of these effects Is needed. Research over recent years has examined a number of management methods of enhancing conservation, environmental and agronomic benefits by manipulating field margins. Some of these involve manipulating crop management, while others involve habitat creation at the field edge. A variety of methods to enhance diversity at field edges have been introduced, including sown grass and flower buffer strips. While minor conflicts exist, notably for the conservation of rare arable weed species and the spread of some pests and weeds, the impacts of well-managed field margins on weed flora and arthropods indicate mostly beneficial effects. Thus field margin strips offer a practical means of providing on-farm biodiversity and enhancing more environmental and sustainable production. In the European Union, financial incentives are included in a range of agri-environment support schemes to encourage active management of field edges by farmers.

AB  - In response to growing concern about impacts of upland agricultural land management on flood risk, an intensely instrumented experimental catchment has been established at Pontbren, a sheep-farmed headwater catchment of the River Severn, UK. Primary aims are to develop understanding of the processes governing flood generation and the associated impacts of land management practices, and to bridge the gap between process understanding and ability to predict effects on downstream flooding. To achieve this, the experiment is designed to operate at plot (∼100 m2), hillslope (∼0.1 km2) and small catchment scale (∼10 km2). Hillslope-scale data, from an under-drained, agriculturally 'improved' pasture, show that drain flow is a dominant runoff process. However, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, overland flow may exceed drain flow rates and can be an important contributor to peak flow runoff at the hillslope-scale. Flow, soil tension data and tracer tests confirm the importance of macropores and presence of perched water tables under 'normal' wet conditions. Comparisons of pasture runoff with that from within a 10 year-old tree shelterbelt show significantly reduced overland flow due to the presence of trees and/or absence of sheep. Comparisons of soil hydraulic properties show significant increases in hydraulic conductivity and saturated moisture content of soil under trees compared to adjacent improved pasture.

AB  - Riparian buffers, the vegetated region adjacent to streams and wetlands, are thought to be effective at intercepting and reducing nitrogen loads entering water bodies. Riparian buffer width is thought to be positively related to nitrogen removal effectiveness by influencing nitrogen retention or removal. We surveyed the scientific literature containing data on riparian buffers and nitrogen concentration in streams and groundwater to identify trends between nitrogen removal effectiveness and buffer width, hydrological flow path, and vegetative cover. Nitrogen removal effectiveness varied widely. Wide buffers (> 50 m) more consistently removed significant portions of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers (0-25 m). Buffers of various vegetation types were equally effective at removing nitrogen but buffers composed of herbaceous and forest/herbaceous vegetation were more effective when wider. Subsurface removal of nitrogen was efficient, but did not appear to be related to buffer width, while surface removal of nitrogen was partly related to buffer width. The mass of nitrate nitrogen removed per unit length of buffer did not differ by buffer width, flow path, or buffer vegetation type. Our meta-analysis suggests that buffer width is an important consideration in managing nitrogen in watersheds. However, the inconsistent effects of buffer width and vegetation on nitrogen removal suggest that soil type, subsurface hydrology (e.g., soil saturation, groundwater flow paths), and subsurface biogeochemistry (organic carbon supply, nitrate inputs) also are important factors governing nitrogen removal in buffers.

AB  - Hedgerows are an important element of the landscape both as a habitat and as a visual component contributing to the character of the countryside. The aim of this paper is to identify key areas of contemporary research into hedgerows in the UK, to assess progress being made in each area, and to highlight areas that need more attention. Key themes were extracted from Barr et al. (1995) and recent papers were assigned to eleven distinct groupings. Two areas were found to have had the most published papers: 'autecological studies' and 'landscape ecology'. Recommendations for future areas of research include the need for a national classification of hedgerow vegetation, long-term large-scale studies on the effects of management and different restoration techniques, and research into population dynamics at the landscape-scale including that into the role of hedgerows as supplementary woodland habitat and as movement corridors.

AB  - Land undulations cause wind shear which change the turbulence of surface winds; high rms turbulence intensities can reach shelter systems. Turbulence estimates are found from the average size of terrain. In horticultural areas turbulence intensities over land may be nearer 40% than 10%. Wind turbulence is graphically depicted on the Van der Hoven spectrum. The high frequency end of this spectrum, which causes wind damage, is distorted by diurnal air temperature changes and more significantly by mechanical wind shear caused by land undulations. This end of the spectrum shifts to the right and upwards for more complex terrain. When wind passes through shelter systems the mean windspeed vertical profile is distorted from the exponential shape. Maximum shear at the first shelterbelt induces maximum turbulence: continual shear generated at successive shelterbelts produces further turbulence and steady vortices. These air motions can induce large plant sway motions as they are closer to plant resonant frequencies. Horticultural shelter systems must reduce mean and turbulent winds by optimized shelterbelt geometry or increased crop resonant frequency.

AB  - Excess nitrogen (N) in freshwater systems, estuaries, and coastal areas has well-documented deleterious effects on ecosystems. Ecological engineering practices (EEPs) may be effective at decreasing nonpoint source N leaching to surface and groundwater. However, few studies have synthesized current knowledge about the functioning principles, performance, and cost of common EEPs used to mitigate N pollution at the watershed scale. Our review describes seven EEPs known to decrease N to help watershed managers select the most effective techniques from among the following approaches: advanced-treatment septic systems, low-impact development (LID) structures, permeable reactive barriers, treatment wetlands, riparian buffers, artificial lakes and reservoirs, and stream restoration. Our results show a broad range of N-removal effectiveness but suggest that all techniques could be optimized for N removal by promoting and sustaining conditions conducive to biological transformations (e.g., denitrification). Generally, N-removal efficiency is particularly affected by hydraulic residence time, organic carbon availability, and establishment of anaerobic conditions. There remains a critical need for systematic empirical studies documenting N-removal efficiency among EEPs and potential environmental and economic tradeoffs associated with the widespread use of these techniques. Under current trajectories of N inputs, land use, and climate change, ecological engineering alone may be insufficient to manage N in many watersheds, suggesting that N-pollution source prevention remains a critical need. Improved understanding of N-removal effectiveness and modeling efforts will be critical in building decision support tools to help guide the selection and application of best EEPs for N management.

AB  - Willow coppice of various Salix spp. has been shown to be a good alternative to fossil fuels both environmentally and economically. Willow stands have also been shown to be adaptable as vegetation filters in order to purify waters and soils. The purification efficiency of willow vegetation filters has been demonstrated in several countries, e.g. Sweden, Poland, Denmark, and Estonia. However, there are still many questions to be answered: for example, what are the mechanisms behind the uptake and allocation of heavy metals and recalcitrant organic constituents, which maximum doses are possible in a particular situation without risks for leakage, and how are hygienic aspects influenced when using vegetation filters. The aim of this paper is to point out some relevant facts concerning willow coppice in general and willow vegetation filters in particular. More specifically, the paper presents and discusses the direct and indirect factors that are improved in such a way that there is a clear benefit of short-rotation forestry. For example, willow cultivations enhance biodiversity compared with conventional agricultural crops and monospecific conifer plantations. They have a pronounced capacity to take up nutrients and heavy metals (including cadmium). The economy is favourable regardless whether the coppice is used as biofuel or as a vegetation filter. The conclusion is that the growing and use of willow coppice is beneficial for the environment and may come to play an important role in a society based on recycling principles.

AB  - Wind and wet coats create dangerous conditions for lambs, even at moderate temperatures. Lambs compromised by factors such as birth injury and small size are particularly at risk. Wet, cold, windy weather added 38-76% to mortality rates in Australian Merino and Corriedale lambs, and in New Zealand lamb breeds added 10-20% (more in snow conditions). Wind shelter removed 3-13% from single lamb mortality rates and 14-37% from twin lamb mortality rates in Australian Merino and Corriedale sheep, but was not effective in reducing losses of twins in cold or wet weather. In New Zealand, wind shelter (such as Pinus radiata tree shelter belts) has generally removed less than 10% from mortality rates. Effective shelter would protect lambs from wind, rain, radiative and conductive heat loss, as well as allowing lambs exposure to the sun. Shelter should be familiar and well dispersed to encourage ewes to isolate from other sheep at lambing. Scattered dense shelter within paddocks such as tussocks or forage grasses or shrubs is very likely to increase lamb survival and possibly growth. Lamb covers also provide effective shelter but are labour-intensive to use. The benefits and management of effective shelter require research so that farmers can be provided with the incentive and means to reduce their considerable losses of neonatal lambs. © The Royal Society of New Zealand 2006.

AB  - In this paper, the current knowledge on mitigation strategies to reduce pesticide inputs into surface water and groundwater, and their effectiveness when applied in practice is reviewed. Apart from their effectiveness in reducing pesticide inputs into ground-and surface water, the mitigation measures identified in the literature are evaluated with respect to their practicability. Those measures considered both effective and feasible are recommended for implementing at the farm and catchment scale. Finally, recommendations for modelling are provided using the identified reduction efficiencies. Roughly 180 publications directly dealing with or being somehow related to mitigation of pesticide inputs into water bodies were examined. The effectiveness of grassed buffer strips located at the lower edges of fields has been demonstrated. However, this effectiveness is very variable, and the variability cannot be explained by strip width alone. Riparian buffer strips are most probably much less effective than edge-of-field buffer strips in reducing pesticide runoff and erosion inputs into surface waters. Constructed wetlands are promising tools for mitigating pesticide inputs via runoff/erosion and drift into surface waters, but their effectiveness still has to be demonstrated for weakly and moderately sorbing compounds. Subsurface drains are an effective mitigation measure for pesticide runoff losses from slowly permeable soils with frequent waterlogging. For the pathways drainage and leaching, the only feasible mitigation measures are application rate reduction, product substitution and shift of the application date. There are many possible effective measures of spray drift reduction. While sufficient knowledge exists for suggesting default values for the efficiency of single drift mitigation measures, little information exists on the effect of the drift reduction efficiency of combinations of measures. More research on possible interactions between different drift mitigation measures and the resulting overall drift reduction efficiency is therefore indicated. Point-source inputs can be mitigated against by increasing awareness of the farmers with regard to pesticide handling and application, and encouraging them to implement loss-reducing measures of “best management practice”. In catchments dominated by diffuse inputs at least in some years, mitigation of point-source inputs alone may not be sufficient to reduce pesticide loads/concentrations in water bodies to an acceptable level.

AB  - We present a conceptual framework that relates agricultural best management practice (BMP) effectiveness with dominant hydrological flow paths to improve nonpoint source (NPS) pollution management. We use the framework to analyze plot, field and watershed scale published studies on BMP effectiveness to develop transferable recommendations for BMP selection and placement at the watershed scale. The framework is based on the location of the restrictive layer in the soil profile and distinguishes three hydrologic land types. Hydrologic land type A has the restrictive layer at the surface and BMPs that increase infiltration are effective. In land type B1, the surface soil has an infiltration rate greater than the prevailing precipitation intensity, but there is a shallow restrictive layer causing lateral flow and saturation excess overland flow. Few structural practices are effective for these land types, but pollutant source management plans can significantly reduce pollutant loading. Hydrologic land type B2 has deep, well-draining soils without restrictive layers that transport pollutants to groundwater via percolation. Practices that increased pollutant residence time in the mixing layer or increased plant water uptake were found as the most effective BMPs in B2 land types. Matching BMPs to the appropriate land type allows for better targeting of hydrologically sensitive areas within a watershed, and potentially more significant reductions of NPS pollutant loading.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the simplification of land uses associated with a strong dependence on agrochemical inputs is decreasing environmental quality, threatening biodiversity, and increasing the likelihood of pest outbreaks. The development of farming systems with greater reliance on ecosystem services, such as biological control of insect pests, should increase the sustainability of agroecosystems. However, the factors responsible for the maintenance or enhancement of natural pest control remain unclear. The goal of this review is, therefore, to expose which elements, from the field to the landscape scale, influence natural enemy populations and pest regulation. We present here the principal effects of seminatural habitats, farming systems, and crop management on the abundance of insect pests and their biological control, with a view to evaluating their relative importance and identifying key elements that regulate natural pest control interactions. Because of the range of spatial and temporal scales experienced by these organisms, we advocate, in studies investigating trophic relations and biological pest control, a clear description of cropping systems and an explicit consideration of seminatural habitats and more generally of the surrounding landscape. Through this review, we also indicate gaps in knowledge and demonstrate the interest of linking agronomy and landscape ecology to understand trophic interactions, maximize natural pest control, and limit pesticide applications. Quantifying the relative importance of both local and landscape scales is a fundamental step in the design and assessment of ecologically sound integrated pest management strategies for farmers.

AB  - Long-term studies of the influence of biogeochemical barriers (shelterbelts and stretches of meadows) on water cycling and control of ground water pollution in an agricultural landscape have shown that more solar energy is used for evapotranspiration in shelterbelts than in cultivated fields or meadows. Therefore, annual water runoff from cultivated fields is about 170% higher than from coniferous forest, 60% higher than deciduous forest and 16% higher than meadows. The differences in evapotranspiration rates between shelterbelts and meadows increases when additional energy input for evapotranspiration is provided by transport of heat from cultivated fields to these habitats by advection. The average water percolation time through the unsaturated zone of soils varies by 100%. A shelterbelt, having a mixed species composition, more effectively screens the passage of chemical compounds dissolved in ground water than shelterbelts composed of one tree species. Peat soils have a very high cation exchange capacity which increases the efficiency of riparian meadows for the control of ground water pollution. Natural landscape features which assist in controlling matter cycles are of great importance for modifying chemical outputs from agricultural watersheds.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) obliges Member States to improve the quality of surface water and groundwater. The measures implemented to date have reduced the contribution of point sources of pollution, and hence diffuse pollution from agriculture has become more important. In many catchments the water quality remains poor. COST Action 869 was an EU initiative to improve surface water quality that ran from 2006 to 2011, in which 30 countries participated. Its main aim was a scientific evaluation of the suitability and cost-effectiveness of options for reducing nutrient loss from rural areas to surface waters at catchment scale, including the feasibility of the options under different climatic and geographical conditions. This paper gives an overview of various categories of mitigation options in relation to phosphorus (P). The individual measures are described in terms of their mode of action, applicability, effectiveness, time frame, environmental side-effects (N cycling) and cost. In total, 83 measures were evaluated in COST Action 869. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shelterbelts are an important component of agriculture in humid severe-winter climatic regions, particularly in areas that are susceptible to erosion and characterized by temperature extremes. Establishment of effective shelterbelts in these regions depends on a number of practices, each being of equal importance. Genetic, physiological and morphological seedling characteristics must be matched to site conditions and function of the planting. Quality of seedlings is important and depends on nursery cultural technique as well as careful seedling processing and handling from the nursery field to the planning site. Site preparation intensity is related to soil, climatic and vegetation characteristics. Recommendations vary considerably and specifications are developed according to local conditions. Weed control is an essential aspect of the shelterbelt establishment. At least 70% weed control, until canopy closure, is necessary for optimum growth and survival of trees. Weed control is most often attained using herbicides, however, mechanical methods using tillage equipment are still common practice. Protection of seedlings from livestock and rodents is necessary. © 1988.

AB  - Agriculture, particularly livestock agriculture, is receiving increasing public scrutiny due to non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution and eutrophication. Much of today's situation may be attributed to system level trends in specialization and intensification that result in excess P entering livestock farms. Balancing P at the farm gate represents a necessary step for long-term soil and water quality protection. Remedial P management combines source and transport control that confront critical areas of P export in surface and subsurface runoff from agricultural landscapes. Source management seeks to immobilize P in the environment through such strategies as reducing soluble P in manure, targeting P application to soils with high retention capacities, and managing soil P. Transport controls employ an understanding of loss or transfer mechanisms to avoid P application on areas with a high transport potential. Also, the potential for P transport can be reduced by implementation of conservation practices such as reduced tillage, terracing, and stream buffers. However, implementation of agricultural management strategies that minimize P export must consider the cost effectiveness of alternative measures, as low practice adoption may limit or impede water quality benefits.

AB  - Riparian buffers are vegetated areas along water bodies that serve an array of functions, ranging from water quality protection, soil erosion control, to species preservation. The establishment and maintenance of riparian buffers have been an important environmental management practice in the United States since the 1970's. Emerging along with this practice is a body of knowledge about riparian butlers. In this article, over 500 articles published in the past three decades are reviewed, substantiating this still evolving field of inquiry, which we shall designate as riparian buffer studies. Among the major findings of the literature review are (1) the literature starts to emerge with greater frequency in the 1980's, grows in depth and scope throughout the 1990's, and continues to the present date; (2) publications surveyed fall into three broad thematic categories that relate to the functions, performance, and policies of riparian buffers, respectively; (3) a large percentage of the publications (over 80%) address issues across thematic categories; (4) this convergence of thematic categories may suggest not only the interwoven nature of the various aspects of riparian buffers, but also the need for a holistic approach to riparian buffer studies; (5) geospatial information technology plays an integral role in the evolution of riparian buffer studies; (6) emerging themes for riparian buffer studies include optimization of benefits, wildlife research, ecosystem restoration, headwater stream functions, economics, restoration, performance, policy, active management, and disturbance ecology, just to name a few.

AB  - Conventional agriculture is based on a high level of chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers, leading to serious environmental impacts, health risks and loss of biodiversity in agrosystems. The reduction of pesticide use is a priority for intensively sprayed agricultural systems such as orchards. The preservation and promotion of biodiversity within orchards and their boundaries is therefore an issue to explore. Indeed, orchard systems contain high plant diversity and perennial multi-strata designs that provide wealthy resources and habitats to living communities such as beneficial organisms. Orchards thus offer favourable areas to maintain food-webs within the agrosystem, provided that favourable situations are not altered by cultural practices such as applying an excess of pesticides. Here, we analysed literature on the effects of the manipulation of plant diversity and habitats on the control of pests by arthropod and bird communities in apple, pear and peach orchards. Many investigations focus on the role of plant management to enhance biodiversity in orchards but only 22 research reports presenting 30 case studies were dedicated to the study of the ecosystem service provided by plant diversity for orchard pest control. The underlying mechanisms were seldom demonstrated, and the tested grass covers and tree assemblages aimed at favouring either the beneficial complex or only some beneficial species to control one or a few pests. The effect of plant management on pest control was mostly positive (16 cases) or null (9), but also negative in some cases (5). This finding reveals the difficulties of identifying selected plants or plant assemblages for the control of key pests. We conclude that further research is needed to identify the processes involved on different scales for biological control. Orchard systems should be re-designed to optimise ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. © 2010 INRA, EDP Sciences.

AB  - Pollution swapping occurs when a mitigation option introduced to reduce one pollutant results in an increase in a different pollutant. Although the concept of pollution swapping is widely understood, it has received little attention in research and policy design. This study investigated diffuse pollution mitigation options applied in combinable crop systems. They are cover crops, residue management, no-tillage, riparian buffer zones, contour grass strips, and constructed wetlands. A wide range of water and atmospheric pollutants were considered, including nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and sulfur. It is clear from this investigation that there is no single mitigation option that will reduce all pollutants.

AB  - A review of the literature showed that spider abundance was increased by diversification in 63% of studies. A comparison of diversification modes showed that spider abundance in the crop was increased in 33% of studies by 'aggregated diversification' (e.g. intercropping and non-crop strips) and in 80% of studies by `interspersed diversification' (e.g., undersowing, partial weediness, mulching and reduced tillage). It is suggested that spiders tend to remain in diversified patches and that extending the diversification throughout the whole crop (as in interspersed diversification) offers the best prospects for improving pest control. There is little evidence that spiders walk in significant numbers into fields from uncultivated field edges, but diversification at the landscape level serves to foster large multi-species regional populations of spiders which are valuable as a source of aerial immigrants into newly planted crops. There are very few manipulative field studies where the impact of spiders on pests has been measured in diversified crops compared with undiversified controls. It is encouraging, however, that in those few studies an increased spider density resulted in improved pest control. Future work needs are identified.

AB  - Recent reports clearly indicate that odor emitted from concentrated livestock production facilities in the Midwest of the US is a significant social problem that negatively impacts rural and state economies, human health, and the quality of rural life. A potential incremental approach to dealing with livestock odor is the use of shelterbelts arranged in strategic designs near and within livestock facilities. This review outlines the various ways that shelterbelts can be effective technology which bio-physically mitigates odor thereby reducing social conflict from odor nuisance. The biophysical potential of shelterbelts to mitigate livestock odor arises from the tree/shrub impacts on the central characteristics and physical behavior of livestock odor. As the majority of odors generated in animal facilities that are detectable at appreciable distances travel as particulates, there is compelling evidence that shelterbelts can ameliorate livestock odor by impeding the movement of these particulates. Because the odor source is near the ground and the tendency of livestock odor is to travel along the ground, shelterbelts of modest heights (i.e. 20-30 ft) may be ideal for odor interception, disruption, and dilution. Shelterbelts can be adapted to fit almost any production situation. Depending on shelterbelt health, these trees can provide long term, year round odor interception, with increasing effectiveness over time. Additionally, more is becoming known about how landscape aesthetics affect how people might perceive livestock odor, suggesting that landscape elements such as shelterbelts can lead to aesthetic improvements and perhaps more positive opinions of livestock odor and the farm systems that create them. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The use of shelterbelts (trees and shrubs) arranged in strategic designs near and within swine facilities potentially can play a significant incremental role in bio-physically mitigating odor in a socio-economically responsible way thereby reducing social conflict from odor nuisance. Shelterbelts of modest heights (i.e. 20-30 ft) may be ideal for plume interception, disruption, and dilution. Based on available evidence, there are five primary ways that shelterbelts can mitigate livestock odors: (1) Physical interception and capture of odor laden dust by trees/shrubs; (2) Dilution of gas concentrations of odor into the lower atmosphere; (3) Ground deposition of odor laden dust due to reduced wind speeds; (4) Providing a biological sink for the chemical constituents of odor after interception; and (5) Enhancing the aesthetics of pork production sites and rural landscapes. Calculated costs for shelterbelt establishment and maintenance over a twenty-year period for four model pork-finishing farms when considering a "seedling price scenario" ($0.50 tree/shrub) are below producer willingness to pay (WTP) for odor mitigation detailed by the USDA. Some "high priced scenarios" ([approximate]$9.59 tree/shrub) exceeded the WTP for producers of certain sizes. Yet, when cost-share programs (e.g. EQIP and CRP) are factored in, the total amortized costs are lowered below all WTP thresholds. Some of the results show positive cost margins (as much as $0.33-$0.59 per pig produced of extra costs to spare) to suggest room for shelterbelts to be part of a "suite of odor management technology". A series of focus groups examined the notion that environmental quality may be marketed by way of producing and labeling as such, "environmentally friendly" pork. The analysis also examines pork producer and consumer interest in the use of shelterbelts as an environmental quality enhancing technology. Pork producers and consumers alike expressed skepticism about the marketability of "odor reduction", suggesting such attributes may better be bundled with other credence type attributes (i.e. animal welfare, locally grown). If consumer's pay for environmental protection by way of a premium for pork products produced with more pollution control then the "traceability" to the producer must be transparent. Producers must benefit directly from such premiums.

AB  - Information on carbon (C) sequestration potential of agroforestry practices (AP) is needed to develop economically beneficial and ecologically and environmentally sustainable agriculture management plans. The synthesis will provide a review of C sequestration opportunities for AP in temperate North America and the estimated C sequestration potential in the US. We estimated carbon sequestration potential for silvopasture, alley cropping, and windbreaks in the US as 464, 52.4, and 8.6 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. Riparian buffers could sequester an additional 4.7 Tg C yr(-1) while protecting water quality. Thus, we estimate the potential for C sequestration under various AP in the US to be 530 Tg yr(-1). The C sequestered by AP could help offset current US emission rate of 1,600 Tg C yr(-1) from burning fossil fuel (coal, oil, and gas) by 33 %. Several assumptions about the area under different AP in the US were used to estimate C sequestration potential: 76 million ha under silvopasture (25 million ha or 10 % of pasture land and 51 million ha of grazed forests), 15.4 million ha (10 % of total cropland) under alley cropping, and 1.69 million ha under riparian buffers. Despite data limitation and uncertainty of land area, these estimates indicate the important role agroforestry could play as a promising CO2 mitigation strategy in the US and temperate North America. The analysis also emphasizes the need for long-term regional C sequestration research for all AP, standardized protocols for C quantification and monitoring, inventory of AP, models to understand long-term C sequestration, and site-specific agroforestry design criteria to optimize C sequestration.

AB  - Increase in the use of conservation practices by agriculture in the United States will enhance soil organic carbon and potentially increase carbon sequestration. This, in turn, will decrease the net emission of carbon dioxide. A number of studies exist that calibrate the contribution of various individual, site-specific conservation practices on changes in soil organic carbon. There is a general absence, however, of a comprehensive effort to measure objectively the contribution of these practices including conservation tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program and conservation buffer strips to an change in soil organic carbon. This paper fills that void. After recounting the evolution of the use of the various conservation practices, it is estimated that organic carbon in the soil in 1998 in the United States attributable to these practices was approximately 12200000 metric tons. By 2008, there will be an increase of approximately 25%. Given that there is a significant potential for conservation practices to lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, there are a number of policy options that can be pursued. These include education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement and regulation and taxes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-point-source pollution of surface and groundwater is a prominent environmental issue in rural catchments, with major consequences on water supply and aquatic ecosystem quality. Among surface-water protection measures, environmental or landscape management policies support the implementation and the management of buffer zones. Although a great number of studies have focused on buffer zones, quantification of the buffer effect is still a recurring question. The purpose of this article is a critical review of the assessment of buffer-zone functioning. Our objective is to provide land planners and managers with a set of variables to assess the limits and possibilities for quantifying buffer impact at the catchment scale. We first consider the scale of the local landscape feature. The most commonly used empirical method for assessing buffers is to calculate water/nutrient budgets from inflow-outflow monitoring at the level of landscape structures. We show that several other parameters apart from mean depletion of flux can be used to describe buffer functions. Such parameters include variability, with major implication for water management. We develop a theoretical framework to clarity the assessment of the buffer effect and propose a systematic analysis taking account of temporal variability. Second, we review the current assessment of buffer effects at the catchment scale according to the theoretical framework established at the local scale. Finally, we stress the limits of direct empirical assessment at the catchment scale and, in particular, we emphasize the hierarchy in hydrological processes involved at the catchment scale: The landscape feature function is constrained by other factors (climate and geology) that are of importance at a broader spatial and temporal scale.

AB  - Abstract: Most arable field margins are sown grass strips which are limited in the avian food resources they offer but potentially supply grass seeds and, depending on the complexity of the sward structure, a range of arthropods. Adding perennial forbs to a grass mixture provides more diverse plant and invertebrate food resources for birds. The availability of seeds and invertebrates on uncropped margins is strongly influenced by management, particularly cutting, cultivation and herbicide use. Cropped margins with reduced chemical inputs and wild bird cover crops can provide relatively high food resources compared with a conventionally managed crop. However, resources are only present until harvest, their plant communities are relatively poor and arthropod abundance is usually lower than in uncropped margins. The best winter food supplies for birds will be provided by options that create seed-rich habitats in winter. The best summer food supplies will be provided by options that create a structurally and floristically diverse sward. The least valuable margin in terms of food resources is a grass-only strip. On an area-for-area basis, field margins will potentially produce food resources for birds more cost-effectively than whole farm practices such as organic farming, though the value of margins will depend on their management and the diversity of margin types at a farm scale. Because no single margin type can provide the optimum year-round food supply, different types of margins should be incorporated at the farm level, but appropriate management (and further innovation in margin design) is needed to deliver their benefits. Field margins should be managed in conjunction with adjacent boundary features, especially hedgerows, to create complex structures that maximise nesting opportunities for birds and create habitats for a range of invertebrates.

AB  - Nutrient retention mechanisms in riparian buffer strips are reviewed with emphasis on surface runoff and subsurface flows, the main pathways of exchanges between the stream and its surroundings. Unique physical and biogeochemical properties prevailing in these riparian ecotones dictate the flux of water, nutrients and other exogenous substances between the upland areas and the stream. Removal of nutrients from surface inflows is induced by deposition of sediment bound nutrients and exchange of dissolved nutrients with the soil/litter surface. Removal of nitrogen in subsurface flows can partly be explained by vegetation uptake, but the main mechanism for removal is usually denitrification. In channelized streams, the subsurface inflows have, in most cases, been altered to discharges via drainage tiles, with the exchange flows (water leaving and re-entering the open-channel via the stream bed and banks) being greatly decreased. Consequently, to improve nitrogen removal in these systems, these flows have to be intercepted or reestablished either through restoration of the old stream valley or through managed structures in the buffer strip
