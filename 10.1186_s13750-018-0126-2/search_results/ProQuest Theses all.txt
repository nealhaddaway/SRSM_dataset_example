AB  - A field experiment was conducted to study root production, soil organic matter, and moisture and sorghum yield in an alley-cropping system with Acacia saligna and Gliricidia sepium in the Hararghe highlands of Ethiopia. Tree hedgerows were planted on either side of a 4-m wide crop alley. Intra-row spacing between trees was 25, 50, and 100 cm. In October, 1994 and March, 1995 soil samples were taken at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm at 50 and 200 cm distance from the hedgerows using direct coring and mesh bags. Roots were separated from the soil by wet-sieving and root weight and root length density were determined. Measurements of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen to a depth of 0-60 cm were made. Field tensiometers were installed at 10, 30 and 60 cm depths. Soil water content was periodically monitored at similar depths. Sorghum grain yield, above-ground dry matter and height were determined. Acacia fine-root ($\le$2 mm) mass was significantly $\rm (p\le 0.05)$ higher than for Gliricidia in the top 30 cm of soil. The presence of fine roots decreased by 55% and 40% for Acacia and Gliricidia, respectively, as the distance increased from 50 to 200 cm from hedgerows. Increase in tree root mass was accompanied by proportionally decreased crop root mass. Results of the March samples showed that the dry period is when trees allocate a higher proportion of carbon to the root system to stay competitive under the dry conditions. Leaf and twig dry matter of Acacia was significantly $\rm (p\le 0.05)$ higher than for Gliricidia. Soil organic matter was lower by 20% and 10% in control and Gliricidia plots compared to Acacia plots. Soil moisture content and water potential measurements indicated that soil moisture was lower in Acacia plots than in the control and Gliricidia plots. Sorghum biomass, grain yield and height were significantly $\rm (p\le 0.05)$ higher with Gliricidia and control than with Acacia. The sorghum yield reduction with Acacia could be largely due to competition for soil moisture.

AB  - Periodic disturbance in CP33 habitat buffers is required to maintain early-successional plant communities for grassland birds. However, effects of disturbance on habitat suitability and nesting success of grassland birds are unknown. Furthermore, the grassland bird community and reproductive performance in CP33 habitat buffers may be influenced by the landscape context (e.g., edge habitat, surrounding land cover). My objectives for this study were to determine how periodic disturbance and the agricultural landscape mosaic influence the breeding grassland bird community in buffers, and how these same factors influence grassland bird nesting success and density in buffers. Data collected during line-transect surveys conducted in CP33 habitat buffers in northeast Mississippi during the 2007-2009 breeding seasons demonstrate periodic disturbance through prescribed burning and light strip-disking does not influence breeding bird diversity or density in buffers. Buffers with woodland at the non-crop edge, however, had the least grassland bird diversity. Dickcissels, one of the most abundant grassland bird species detected in buffers, had a lesser, though non-significant, density in woodland-bordered than in grassland-bordered buffers. I estimated nest success of Dickcissels and Red-winged Blackbirds using maximum likelihood approaches modeling daily survival rates of nests in Program MARK. Analysis results indicated periodic disturbance did not inform models of nest success for either species to an extent requiring inclusion in the best approximating model. Both species, however, had greater nest densities in control and burned buffers than in disked buffers, as well as adjacent to grassland and crop edges. Dickcissel nest success was associated negatively to proximity of developed areas and amount of land cover in crop production, and associated positively with nest height. Red-winged Blackbird nest success decreased with increasing distance from a crop edge and decreasing height of surrounding vegetation, but increased with greater amounts of ground cover. Results from this study will assist land managers with selecting land for enrollment in CP33 that will maximize producers' conservation goals while minimally impacting crop production, as well as assist with development and refinement of USDA-NRCS Practice Standards, documentation of ecological benefits of federally subsidized conservation practices, and enhancement of wildlife benefits in agriculture-dominated landscapes. Key Words: buffers, birds, disturbance, landscape, edge, grassland

AB  - Shelterbelts and windbreaks have been long used to improve crop production by controlling wind damage, preserving soil-moisture, and preventing soil erosion. Many aspects of shelterbelts have been to some extent explored, but there are some contradicting reports in the literature concerning certain issues. In this study certain aspects of shelterbelt aerodynamics are investigated. Experimental data are used to study the effects of free stream velocity on the wind-reducing ability of shelterbelts and to test an aerodynamic numerical model. The tested model is then used to explore the controversial issue of windspeed reduction, the extent of protection in the lee and to study the relationship between shelter efficiency and density. The data analysis reveals that the incidence angle and the windspeed in the open are negatively correlated to the reduced windspeed in the lee. A significant deflection for oblique winds is found to be consistent with the large pressure gradient observed across shelterbelts. Results of simulations using the tuned model are in good agreement with observed wind profiles. Numerical simulations show that the protected leeward distance is larger for medium density shelters than for the very dense ones. The shear stress at the ground is consistent with the simulated wind profiles and in good agreement with previous observations. Overall model performance is satisfactory.

AB  - Dramatically higher fuel prices and massive petroleum imports from politically unstable countries have contributed to a major national initiative to generate renewable fuels in the United States. Often, such policies are enacted and implemented with huge taxpayer expenditures without due diligence to the consequences. The evaluation of the water quality impacts of converting pastureland to intensive biomass production for fuel in a southern Texas watershed suggest significant increases erosion and nutrient loadings to water bodies. The Best Management Practices (BMPs), cover crop and filter strips when implemented individually failed to produce status-quo reduction levels. Combined BMPs implementation produced improved mitigation, at substantially higher costs, highlighting the issue of sustainability related to the economics of renewable fuels. The estimation of the net energy of biomass ethanol accounting for the production input data indicate a greater than one energy return for biomass crops. However, the policy results indicate that only 70 percent in net contribution to the energy supply is achieved due to relatively lower energy returns compared to conventional fossil fuels. In addition, because the ethanol produced has to have the energy used deleted from the total, the cost of producing a gallon of biomass ethanol is substantially higher than that of gasoline. The impacts of an exogenously-specified biofuel mandate fulfilled by the production of a dedicated biomass crop and its consequent effects on commodity prices and overall welfare are estimated. Net farm income increased due to an increase in crop prices; however, both consumer surplus and total surplus decreased. The analysis is extended to estimate the sensitivity of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres returning to crop production and the potential of higher biomass yields. The results indicate that net farm income decreased and consumer surplus increased due to a decrease in crop prices, resulting in an increase in overall welfare. This current research evaluates the unintended consequences of the U.S. energy policy and provides interesting insights of the potential economic and environmental impacts. These results suggest policy makers should be cautious before enacting energy policy and consider multiple alternative energy sources in an economic and financial context to achieve a sustainable energy goal.

AB  - Controlling agricultural nonpoint source pollution from livestock grazing is a necessary step to improving the water quality of the nation's streams. The goal of enhanced stream water quality will most likely result from the implementation of an integrated system of best management practices (BMPs). To evaluate the effect of BMPs on cattle position preference and subsequently stream water quality and streambank erosion, research pastures were developed along two perennial streams located on the University of Kentucky Animal Research Center (ARC) in Woodford County, Kentucky. The project site consisted of two replications of three treatments: (1) BMPs (alternate water source, alternate shade source, and forage improvements such as strategic fertilizer and herbicide applications) and a fenced riparian area to exclude cattle from the stream except at a 3.7 m wide stream crossing, (2) BMPs with free stream access, and (3) limited BMPs (e.g. natural shade) with free stream access (control). The effects of BMP systems (with and without a fenced riparian buffer) on altering cattle position preference were examined via GPS collars. Results indicated that the BMP systems did not affect cattle position preference during the daytime or the nighttime. However, significant time effects were noted for some pasture features, namely cooling features, dry bedding areas, and potentially areas of higher forage quantity and/or quality. Water quality trends were monitored using grab samples collected from the upstream and downstream edges of each pasture plot (i.e. treatment). Analyses of the data indicated that minimal water quality benefits were incurred by implementing a BMP system (with or without a partially excluded riparian zone). However, these results might differ if cattle were completely excluded from the stream (i.e. no stream crossing) or if the BMP system was implemented at a site with larger pastures, different geology (nonkarst), soils (low in phosphorus), or stream morphology (nonbedrock bottom channel). Streambank erosion rates were monitored at fifty permanent cross sections that were established throughout the project site. Erosion levels increased as stream flow, cattle activity and treatment level (1 = greatest number of BMPs to 3 = control) increased. Results from this project highlight the importance of examining grazing management from a holistic viewpoint rather than from a component oriented format.

AB  - This research was designed to determine the impacts of a variety of forestry management alternatives on stream ecosystems in three sets of replicated watersheds of the Ouachita Province in the Interior Highlands of Arkansas, USA. Macroinvertebrate species assemblages in a variety of substrates (gravel, bryophytes, bare stones, leaf packs, and large woody debris (LWD)) were the principal biota used as indicators of environmental quality, but bryophytes were also used in this way. Retention of particulate organic matter was evaluated for bryophyte patches, bare stones, and added trees. Several related but independent experimental designs were used to address a series of questions concerning effects of silvicultural methods. One design compared benthic macroinvertebrates among five different silvicultural methods applied to very small ($<$5 ha) watersheds: (1) clearcutting, (2) seed tree, (3) pine shelterwood, (4) group selection, and (5) pine single tree selection. In each treatment 10 m buffer strips were left on each side of the streams and adjacent uncut watersheds were used as controls. In another design, four watersheds (660 ha each) with different histories of management were compared: (1) no cutting in nearly a century, (2) uneven age management, (3) mixed uneven age and pine plantation, and (4) loblolly pine plantation. Oak and pine logs also were placed in these streams at the 660 ha cross-sections to compare them regarding macroinvertebrate colonization. Finally, LWD was added to 100 m reaches of four similar streams to evaluate effects of this on retention of coarse particulate organic matter and on macroinvertebrates. Invertebrates were more abundant and diverse in streams draining watersheds with the highest intensities of forest management (clearcuts, pine plantations). Bryophyte patches and large woody debris (LWD) provided enhanced retention of fine and coarse particulate organic matter, respectively, and preferred habitats for invertebrates. Bryophyte patches were less abundant in streams of disturbed watersheds. Since bryophyte patches are important as providers of food and refuge for invertebrates, bryophytes may deserve protection by watershed managers. Macroinvertebrates were sensitive indicators of intensity of forest management in these small watersheds. Apparently they benefit from resources lost from the terrestrial component of the watersheds.

AB  - Contour hedgerow systems are being considered to control soil erosion in the steepland areas of the tropics. The relationships between the hedgerow crops, soil processes, and crop production are poorly understood. This research, performed from 1988 to 1992 on two Oxisols with 26% slope, evaluated the effects of contour hedgerow systems on soil properties, Br$\sp-$ transport, and crop production. Main plot treatments included double rows of Gliricidia sepium (G); Gliricidia and Paspalum notatum (GP); Gliricidia and Penisetum purpureum (napier grass) (GN); and napier grass (Nap), planted at approximately 5.5-m intervals; and the control (C) had no hedgerows. Subplot treatments were 0 and 60 kg N ha$\sp{-1}$ per crop in a rice-corn crop rotation. Each crop received 20 kg ha$\sp{-1}$ of both P and K. The Gliricidia prunings and food crop residues were used as mulch on the respective plots and the clippings of napier were removed from the plots. Bromide as KBr was broadcast on treatments GP and C at a rate of 200 kg ha$\sp{-1}$ and the Br$\sp-$ concentration in the soil, soil solution, and runoff water were monitored periodically. There was about 20% reduction in food crop yield the first two years after hedgerow establishment. In the following years rice and corn yields were higher on treatments G and GP relative to C when no N was applied, but lower on treatment Nap regardless of N application. Soil organic C, pH, exchangeable Ca, and Bray-2 P, and available water porosity increased and exchangeable Al decreased with decrease in soil elevation in the alleys. This gradient caused higher food crop yields in the lower half of the alley. Yield was suppressed in the first few rows adjacent to each hedgerow because of competition for water and nutrients. Soil loss for treatment GP was reduced to about 72% of the 42 t ha$\sp{-1}$ yr$\sp{-1}$ loss for treatment C. Bromide leaching tended to be greater in the GP than in C plots. Contour hedgerows with G appear promising as a practice to improve soil productivity and reduce soil erosion.

AB  - Forested buffers along riparian zones (riparian buffers) are a common feature in agricultural and forested landscapes throughout North America. While the primary function of riparian buffers is to protect water quality and fish habitat, they may also provide valuable breeding habitat for other organisms. This study was designed to investigate the conservation value of riparian buffers and riparian forest to breeding birds along streams and small rivers in the Acadian forest of mainland Nova Scotia. This study attempted to answer three main questions: Do forest bird guilds and individual species abundances differ between riparian and upland areas? Do riparian buffers maintain similar bird assemblages and species abundances as riparian references? Are bird assemblages and species abundances related to riparian buffer width? Birds were surveyed in 2005 and 2006 using 200-300 m transects for three treatments: riparian buffers, riparian references, and upland references. In 2005, birds were surveyed once in riparian buffers (n = 12), riparian references (n = 8) and upland references (n = 9). In 2006, birds were surveyed 3 times in riparian buffers (n = 15), riparian references (n = 15), and upland references (n = 15). In addition, forest structure and site features were measured within the first 30 m of streams for riparian sites and within the first 30 m of survey transects for upland sites. Additional visits were made in 2006 to collect additional breeding evidence. Abundances of individual bird species and ecological guilds, with a special emphasis on species of conservation concern, were compared among treatments using densities of potential breeding pairs calculated from detections of birds located within 30 m of study transects. As well, forest structure was compared among treatments. Most forest structure variables were similar among treatments. However, riparian references had a greater basal area of coniferous trees than upland sites, and greater canopy cover than riparian buffers. Bird assemblages showed differences between treatments with riparian buffers having more open-edge species than references. Bird assemblages were fairly similar between riparian and upland references. Buffer width, and not forest structure, best explained abundances of total potential pairs, species of conservation concern as a group, and Golden-crowned Kinglets, although these relationships were relatively weak. Species of conservation concern as a group had consistently higher abundances in buffers ≥ 40 m wide and as such buffers of this width are recommended to conserve breeding birds in mainland Nova Scotia.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to determine the technical and financial feasibility of agroforestry systems in Punjab, Pakistan. One study was on cultivated land and examined the effects of single row, 6 to 7$1\over2$ year old, shelterbelts on wheat and sorghum yield. Three different row spacings (10 m, 12 m and 15 m) of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Bombex ceiba were studied. The other study was on saline fallow land and examined the feasibility of using block plantations to reclaim the soil. Acacia nilotica and Eucalyptus camaldulensis were grown as monocultures and as a mixed plantation for six years and the yield, economics and soil amelioration were documented. In the shelterbelt study, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was the variable most strongly correlated with production of wheat (r = 0.67) and sorghum (r = 0.89). Wheat yield was least within 1 m of the trees and increased as distance from the trees increased up to 5 m. Beyond 5 m there was no significant difference in yield. Wheat production was greater adjacent to B. ceiba than E. camaldulensis. There was no significant difference in wheat yield between year six and seven, but the seventh year yield was consistently lower than the sixth. The benefit cost ratio (B:C) and net present value (NPV) were greater in all agroforestry treatments than the agronomic monoculture and they were greater in narrow tree row spacing than wider row spacing. In the block plantation study, E. camaldulensis had a greater bole length and girth in the mixed plantations, possibly because of the greater availability of nitrogen associated with the presence of the leguminous A. nilotica. All three treatments had a very attractive B:C, NPV and internal rate of return; the mixed plantation had a greater return than the monocultures. Organic matter, N, P, and K increased and Na, SAR, pH, EC, and bulk density decreased in the soils under the trees compared to fallow plots.

AB  - The importance of protecting water quality and aquatic resources are increasing because of harmful human impacts within and around waterways. Establishing or restoring functional riparian areas protect water quality and are a good mechanism to conserve aquatic systems, plants, and wildlife. Laser-based remote sensing technology offers a high resolution approach to both characterize and document changes in riparian buffer zones (RBZs). The objectives of this study were to build a model to calculate riparian buffer width on both sides of a stream using a LiDAR-derived slope variable, to classify riparian buffers and determine their quality, and to evaluate the appropriateness of using LiDAR in riparian buffer assessment. For this purpose, RBZs were delineated for Hunnicutt and King Creek, which are located in Oconee and Pickens counties, in South Carolina. Results show that LiDAR was effective in delineating required riparian buffer widths based on the topography slope of upstream areas, and to calculate the ratio of tree cover in those riparian buffer zones to qualify them. Furthermore, the riparian buffer assessment model that was created in this research has potential for use in different sites and different studies.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) and sediment losses in runoff from agricultural land are a serious environmental issue because of the impact on surface water quality and eutrophication. The main factors affecting the transport of P to surface waters are erosion and runoff. Non-application setbacks, perennial vegetative filters, reservoirs, terraces, reduced tillage, and other management practices are intended to reduce P and sediment loss from the watersheds. Four major hypotheses were tested in this study: (1) P and sediment loss are reduced when manure is not applied within setbacks around conduits to surface water; (2) Grass filters will result in reduced sediment and P loading with increased effectiveness as the area ratio of filter to drainage basin increases; 3) 15-20% of the watershed area is the source of more than 50% of P and sediment loading; and 4) Contaminant loading of Duck Creek can be reduced by 30-50% by increasing the use of conservation BMPs on 50% of the watershed land area. Research was conducted under rainfed agricultural systems in eastern Nebraska to address the following objectives: (1) to determine the effectiveness of non-application setbacks for manure from conduits to surface waters in reducing P and sediment in runoff; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of grass filters in reducing runoff volume and loss of P and sediment; (3) to assess the impact of management practices on sediment and nutrient losses from the watershed using a watershed model; and (4) to evaluate different management scenarios required to achieve further targeted reductions in sediment and P loss to surface waters using a watershed model. The seven treatments of the setback study included no manure applied and nonapplication setbacks of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 m around the riser with the setback distances limited on the terrace side by the top of terraces. Runoff sampling methods were compared and the effects of drainage basin characteristics determined. The effect of grass filters on sediment and P concentration was determined from four runoff events in 2006-2008 when nearly all plots had runoff. The grass filters also were evaluated for effect on runoff volume and contaminants load using total annual runoff and composite samples collected from 12 runoff events. In the watershed modeling study, the SWAT model was used to evaluate the effects of tillage, grass filter strips, and terraces on nutrient and sediment loss. Critical areas for these contaminants were identified in the watershed and implementation of management scenarios was simulated on targeted vulnerable areas to identify means of reducing nutrient and sediment loss to targeted levels. Three BMPs scenarios were simulated using SWAT model on the small sub-basin to present the impact of different scenarios on sediment reduction and illustrate the importance of BMPs placing and distribution at hydrologic response units.

AB  - Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides in the agricultural industry today and, as a result, can commonly be found in many bodies of water in the Midwest. Atrazine and its metabolites have been shown to have many adverse effects on plants and animals within an ecosystem. Previous research has shown that phytoremediation of atrazine by switchgrass has potential to be a viable remediation strategy. The long-term goal of this research arc is to establish switchgrass buffer strips along the lower edge of fields and along terraces to help remove atrazine from surface water runoff. To further the knowledge of atrazine phytoremediation by switchgrass and to work towards the long-term goal, the current research project had two objectives: (1) determine degradation of atrazine using radiolabeled 14C-atrazine to allow for more in-depth analysis than previous studies and (2) determine the possible exudation of atrazine metabolites from the switchgrass after uptake and degradation. The research presented here shows that atrazine was taken up and degraded into the metabolites deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, didealkylatrazine, and cyanuric acid. Contrary to published research, I did not find the metabolite hydroxyatrazine present in switchgrass tissues, suggesting that degradation of hydroxyatrazine does not occur in the switchgrass plant. Additionally, I showed that switchgrass did not exude metabolites of atrazine into soil following uptake and degradation.

AB  - The ecology of arable springtails (Collembola) was investigated in relation to pesticide exposure and recovery. Lepidocyrtus spp., Isotomurus spp., Bourletiella hortensis, Isotoma viridis, and I. Notabilis overwintered as surface-active adults within fields where they could potentially be exposed to pesticide deposition at a time when little or no crop cover was present. Sminthurus viridis and Sminthurinus elegans overwintered as eggs in the field soil, where exposure to sprayed winter pesticide applications would be expected to be lower than for surface-active species. The eggs of S. viridis, S. elegans and B. hortensis from field soils were resistant to periods of drought, although resistance varied among species. This study provided the first evidence for drought tolerance in eggs of S. viridis, S. elegans and B. hortensis in northern European arable habitats; viable eggs survived a four-month period of simulated drought in the laboratory. Drought resistance of some species is likely to alter the community composition in fields and hence affect the availability of vulnerable species for monitoring pesticide non-target effects.S. elegans, S. viridis and I. viridis dispersed into arable fields from an adjacent hedgerow, providing the first evidence that hedgerows may be important sources for collembolan recolonisation of arable fields. B. hortensis, Isotomurus spp. and Lepidocyrtus spp. were found to recover from population sources within the field itself. Certain species including B. hortensis, Isotomurus spp. and E. multifasciata were consistently found in the vicinity of hedgerows and may be unlikely to be true arable field species, and hence of limited use in studies monitoring pesticide effects.Collembolan abundance and community composition were compared in fields managed under organic, conventional and integrated regimes to assess the effects of farming systems. Differences in community composition were identified among regimes, although no individual species or species assemblage was indicative of any of the farming management systems.

Differences in community composition were identified among regimes, although no individual species or species assemblage was indicative of any of the farming management systems. Abundance of individual species varied among fields and regions, suggesting that the scale at which comparisons are made may affect the likelihood of detecting pesticide effects. The results of this study are discussed with respect to the use of Collembola for ecological monitoring of non-target pesticide effects.

AB  - Land use practices can adversely affect water quality and freshwater mussel populations. Water quality can become degraded by siltation from development, pesticides and nutrients from agricultural fields, heavy metals and other toxins from urban runoff. The relationship between land use/land cover and freshwater mussel populations was investigated in the upper Neuse River basin in North Carolina. Mussel surveys were conducted from April to August of 2001 in the Eno, Flat, Smith, New Light, and Little River watersheds. Surveys (n = 44) were conducted along 300-m transects upstream and downstream of bridges to examine the effect of bridge crossing structures on mussel assemblages. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) hydrological modeling tools were used to delineate upstream catchments of each sample site and to determine drainage areas. GIS was used to quantify land use/land cover within multiple spatial areas: upstream catchment, upstream riparian buffers (100 m and 250 m widths), and local riparian buffers (100 m and 250 m widths) immediate to the sample sites. Other environmental variables included stream slope, road density, water chemistry, and habitat quality assessment scores. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - <![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Farmland birds in Europe have declined as agriculture has intensified, with granivorous specialists disproportionately affected. Despite grassland based farming being widespread, farmland bird research to date has focussed on mixed and arable farms. Yellowhammers are a red-listed species in the UK. This study investigated year round habitat requirements, diet, and movements of yellowhammers at four grassland dominated farms in Ayrshire, Scotland. Data were obtained via field surveys and trials, radio-tracking and faecal analysis. Fine scale breeding season foraging habitat requirements were studied by comparing invertebrate and vegetation communities at foraging sites with paired controls across all four farms. A small scale winter supplementary feeding trial was conducted on one farm. Breeding yellowhammers were distributed throughout the study sites; average density was low at 0.11 pairs per hectare (range 0.06 to 0.15), half the densities reported in arable and mixed regions. Yellowhammers preferentially foraged within 10m of field margins. Grassland summer foraging sites contained significantly higher invertebrate diversity and more large invertebrates than control sites. Faecal analysis revealed that adults ate significantly more cereal than nestlings, with both including more invertebrate material than observed in previous studies. Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae were key orders, with Lepidoptera larvae additionally important for nestlings. A low proportion of cereal was found in nestling diet, suggesting that the invertebrate dominated diet provided was of high quality. <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In contrast to summer diet, and despite grassland being the dominant habitat, cereal dominated winter diet; grass seeds and invertebrates accounted for &lt;1% of diet in winter. Winter yellowhammer density at each farm was positively correlated with stubble availability. Radio-tracking found yellowhammers significantly selected stubble in early winter and game managed habitat in late winter. Supplementary feeding attracted an estimated 247 to 267 yellowhammers at a site where the previous year¿s winter surveys recorded only 5 birds despite holding a good breeding population. Survival rates of 1st years at the supplementary fed site appeared higher than elsewhere in the landscape, and a small increase in breeding density was observed post feeding. As winter progressed, the use of the grain provided increased, suggesting that the late winter period was the most crucial time for the birds regarding food supply. <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Providing supplementary food represents a cheap and easy solution that could be utilised by agri-environment schemes to tackle late winter farmland bird food shortages. Alternatively, increasing winter stubble in grassland dominated regions should provide additional biodiversity benefits associated with increased landscape heterogeneity as well as increased winter food availability. This study highlights differences in breeding density, habitat selection, movements and diet of yellowhammers on grassland farms compared to arable and mixed farm populations. Restricted winter stubble habitat limits winter food availability, and hence the likely overall size of the population able to subsist in this habitat. ]]>

AB  - Giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt) Muhl.], a native bamboo, is an integral component of bottomland forests in the southeastern United States. Cane occurs as monodominant stands, also known as canebrakes, which historically covered vast areas of land. As a result of land conversion, overgrazing and altered fire regimes, an alarming 98% reduction of canebrakes has occurred. Due to the ecological significance of giant cane as wildlife habitat, a riparian buffer, its role in soil stabilization and potential as woody biomass, restoration interest has increased. Research with planted cane indicated fertilization and burning had interacting effects on cane growth, however in remnant natural stands, the influence of burning and fertilization on canebrake growth and spread is unknown. This study examined the survival and growth response of cane to burning and fertilization in remnant stands to provide guidance for rehabilitation, restoration and management. Four treatment plots were replicated eight times across seven sites in canebrakes growing in riparian zones adjacent to agricultural fields in the Cache River Watershed, Illinois. The four treatments were randomized factorial design of: 1) burning, 2) fertilization, 3) burning/fertilization, or 4) control. Within treatment plots, two interior and three exterior 1-m 2 subplots were randomly established to measure culm density (stems/ha), height (cm), diameter (mm), and spread (increase in live culm density by the outward movement from interior subplots into exterior subplots) prior to treatment and after one and two growing seasons. Fertilized and fertilized/burned plots were treated in summers of 2011 and 2012 with a half corn rate of nitrogen (56 kg ha -1 ), phosphorus (22 kg ha-1 ), and potassium (37 kg ha-1 ). Prescribed burning took place in March 2012. Data were analyzed using a three way analysis of variance (fire, fertilization and subplot) (α = 0.05). At year 0 (2011), culm density, height and diameter were not significantly different among treatments. By year 2, live culm density in interior plots slightly increased, however density in exterior plots tended to more than double, indicating canebrake expansion over time. Fertilization tended to increase height and had little effect on cane diameter. Research suggests that cane typically increases in both height and diameter simultaneously, suggesting that fertilization only partially provides the resources needed to stimulate growth. Further analysis on fertilization application rates and timing may be necessary to ascertain the efficiency of its role in culm growth and development. Giant cane responded to prescribed burning through a decrease in height and culm diameter. However, fire increased culm density through stimulation of the growth of new culms. In addition, though fire consumed a portion of existing culms, the canebrake emerged vigorously, demonstrating prescribed fire's utility as a tool for land managers to reduce competition and increase canebrake health and expansion.

AB  - Nitrogen (N), particularly nitrate (NO3- ), is a critical pollutant in many northeastern US watersheds that is especially detrimental to coastal marine ecosystems. Agricultural land, which receives fertilizers and/or animal manures, is a principal source of N loading to the environment. The most effective NO 3- attenuation mechanism is probably microbial denitrification, i.e., the transformation of NO3- into N gases (e.g., NO, N2 O, N2 ). Currently, our estimates of the magnitudes of denitrification rates at landscape scales are "tentative" at best, usually based on large-scale watershed budgets in which denitrification was estimated by difference. One reason that denitrification is hard to quantify is that a large amount of denitrification occurs in disproportionately small parts of the landscape (i.e., hotspots) and over relatively short periods (i.e., hot moments). Denitrification occurs primarily under anaerobic conditions by heterotrophic microbes and is expected to be vigorous in wet soils high in organic carbon. There is good evidence that these conditions correlate strongly with the likelihood of soil saturating, i.e., hydrological sensitivity, thus, by juxtaposing hydrology and biogeochemistry we can elucidate the distribution of denitrification hotspots across the landscape. We used nitrogen isotopes to quantify and characterize spatial patterns of denitrification in riparian zones and other saturated soils (i.e., the shallow saturated zone) of an agricultural landscape. In situ denitrification rates in shallow groundwater were determined monthly using the 15 N-NO3- push-pull method. Annual rates of denitrification showed a strong positive relationship with topographic index, a well-known wetness index and indicator of hydrologic similarity. The resulting relationship was used to distribute denitrification rates across the landscape and estimate denitrification N fluxes from the shallow saturated zone. Denitrification in the shallow saturated zone resulted in a N flux that was nearly half of the total denitrification from the landscape--in about a third of the area--as determined from an unusually well-constrained whole-farm N balance constructed from farm records and field measures. Denitrification N flux rates from saturated riparian soils were among the highest in the landscape, however the contribution of riparian areas to total landscape denitrification was less than 10 percent.

AB  - Populations of Poa trivialis L., a perennial grass species, were collected from hedgerows and riversides, from long- term grasslands and from annual arable crops. These populations were grown under various conditions, including spaced-plant conditions, dense stands, and in competition with wheat. In spite of large phenotypic differences between populations observed in the original habitats, there was no conclusive evidence of genetically determined ecotypic differences between populations. There was also little evidence of appreciable genetic variation within populations, except when plants were exposed to inadequate cold preconditioning, which prevented flowering in some genotypes.Individual genotypes of P. trivialis exhibited high levels of phenotypic plasticity, for most of the attributes measured when exposed to contrasting growing conditions, e.g. open or enclosed conditions, different densities, or different defoliation frequencies. This phenotypic plasticity is probably sufficient to account for the wide phenotypic differences shown by populations in their original habitats.The variable performance of populations in response to different severities of competition, e.g. spaced-plant, dense-stands, and intense inter-specific competition, indicate the dangers of extrapolating the results of spaced-plant trials to the competitive conditions that normally exist in both natural and agricultural plant communities.Attempts were made to investigate the breeding system of P. trivialis, and the mode of inheritance of flowering behaviour. The results were generally inconclusive, and very dependent upon the test conditions.The results are considered in the context of ecological genetic studies and of forage plant breeding programmes.

AB  - Agricultural nitrate can have a negative environmental impact on surface waters, such as rivers that drain into the Chesapeake Bay. Riparian buffer strips are considered to provide natural remediation for groundwater nitrate, but this function is based on relatively simple models of riparian zone hydrology and stratigraphy. The purpose of this study was to assess the combined influences of hydrology and geochemistry on groundwater nitrate in a riparian zone. The study site, at the USDA-Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, is in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain of Maryland. The site contains a small 1 st -order stream that is instrumented with five stations for monitoring stream flow and chemistry, and 170 nested piezometers (mostly in transects) for evaluating groundwater hydrology and geochemistry. The portion of the stream that shows the highest rate of flow increase per area contains discrete zones of enhanced groundwater discharge to the surface. These zones display high vertical hydraulic heads, which relate to the amount of groundwater discharged. One particular area of intense groundwater upwelling supplies approximately 3.5% of the total stream outflow, yet comprises only 0.006% of the riparian zone (or 0.001% of total catchment area). The upwelling zones also supply most of the nitrate to the surface. Dissolved oxygen concentrations are high in the underlying aquifer, and in the overlying soil where hydraulic heads are high. Areas where upwelling groundwater is absent display anaerobic conditions throughout the soil. Oxic conditions, rapid groundwater movement, and limited contact area inhibit nitrate removal in upwelling zones. Chloride, sulfate, and dinitrogen data confirm that the direction of groundwater flow in upwelling areas is vertical. Valley morphology, combined with subsurface stratigraphy and macroporosity, are largely responsible for deviation from more commonly assumed horizontal flow in the subsurface. The geomorphological and stratigraphic setting, where valley fill consists of fine-grained wetland soils over a more hydraulically-conductive aquifer, is typical for the mid-Atlantic coastal plain. Groundwater-fed headwater wetlands are also common in this region, so the results of this research may be applicable to a larger extent, and should be viewed in the context of the wider problem of surface water nitrate loading.

AB  - Infiltration water and sediment mass retained are the two key processes for pesticide mass retention by buffer strips from agricultural runoff, based on the review of 106 published articles. Estimates, based on average published data for runoff volume and sediment mass retention, show that the average pesticide retention is 46, 51, and 70 % for the three sorption classes (Koc<100, 100<Koc<1000, and Koc>1000, respectively). Source area to buffer area ratios ranging between 10:1 to 50:1 are more practical and effective under field applications of buffer strips. Buffer strips have an upper area where larger particles settle and a lower area where runoff containing fine particles passes through. Rainfall-runoff experiments were conducted on 1.0 m wide x 5.6 m long switchgrass buffer strips to measure pesticide mass transport through buffer strips receiving runoff containing different sized sediment under steady-state rainfall intensity of 6.35 cm/h. Twenty four strips were used to provide three replications each of the sediment type treatments of fine sand, fine aggregates, clay-sized particles, and no sediment; and two treatments of flow convergence represented by source area to buffer area ratios of 10:1 and 30:1. Atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and linuron were used in the experiments at the label recommended rates using field formulations. When receiving runoff mixed with fine sand, buffer strips retained 73% and 53% atrazine, 87% and 80% chlorpyrifos, and 81% and 54% linuron for the two area ratios of 10:1 and 30:1 respectively. The corresponding numbers, when receiving runoff mixed with fine aggregates, were 72% and 54% atrazine, 87% and 71% chlorpyrifos, and 76% and 58% linuron respectively for the two area ratios. Switchgrass buffer strips retained, on average, 70.1% and 49.2% atrazine, 83.0% and 57.6% chlorpyrifos, and 71.2% and 50.4% linuron, respectively for the two area ratios of 10:1 and 30:1 when receiving simulated runoff containing clay-sized particles. Linuron data presented in these experiments is an estimate and readers are cautioned when interpreting linuron data. Results were significantly different for atrazine when the two area ratios were compared for all three sediment types. Results for chlorpyrifos and linuron were not significantly different between the two area ratios indicating the strips performed equally well under both flow conditions in case of sediment type fine sand and fine aggregates. In case of clay-sized particles, results for atrazine and linuron were significantly different for the two area ratios indicating flow convergence can impact atrazine and linuron retention by buffer strips. In case of fine sand, outflow from the buffer strips showed some re-entrainment of sediment from previously deposited sediment, buffer strip soil, or erosion at the exit point, which needs to be further investigated. Infiltration and sediment retention were the key processes for pesticide retention in case of fine aggregates, whereas infiltration alone was the key process in case of fine sand and clay-sized particles. VFSMOD-W, embedded with the empirical linear-additive pesticide mass retention model was used to predict atrazine, chlorpyrifos and linuron retention by the switchgrass buffer strips studied in the experiments. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of the switchgrass soil was the key parameter in calibrating the model to the experimental conditions, indicating type of buffer strip vegetation and timing of calibration data collection are important factors. Predicted pesticide mass retention results indicate that the performance of buffer strips receiving runoff from farm fields containing large proportions of fine sand or clay-sized particles needs to be further investigated.

AB  - Runoff originating from irrigated pastures in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, in California, contains different pollutants (such as nutrients, sediment and pathogens) that can have serious environmental impacts in water systems downstream. In addition, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in runoff can influence drinking water quality by forming trihalomethanes (THM), which are hazardous to human health. The effectiveness of THM reduction in irrigated pasture systems with the use of filter strips and the fate of DOM in these systems have received little attention. In this thesis, I tested the use of filter strips in pastures to help improve the quality of runoff water. The approach tested the retention of pollutants from pasture runoff by grassed filter strips (2 m wide) in retaining loads of pollutants originating from pastures (3 m wide). Grassed strips were an effective pollutant load reduction strategy for phosphorus and Escherichia coli, yet, in the case of nitrate and DOM, reduction efficiency was dependent upon the volume of runoff. There was no improvement in NH4+ reductions with the use of filter strips. Overall, filter strips successfully decreased nutrient and pathogen load and irrigation management indicated to be an important factor in filter strip efficiency. Filter strips play an important role in reducing the pollutants in runoff and helping improve runoff water quality in irrigated pastures.

AB  - The rate of rapid land use change in the Midwest has resulted in impairments to watershed due to loss of riparian vegetation and increased impervious surfaces especially along headwater streams. An important question for conservation professionals is how to influence private streamside land managers to promote and restore stream health. This study borrows an approach from the field of risk communication to assess gaps in understanding of ecosystem knowledge among streamside landowners in an urbanizing Ohio watershed as well as their land management decisions and key influences. In a risk communication study it is important to address what participants know and do not know about the risk, decisions they face, and the main influences on those decisions (Morgan, Bostrom, Lave, & Atman, 2002). Participants seemed to understand the risk to streams from runoff and urbanization including pollutant loading in streams from sediment, nutrients, and pathogens. Participants were also aware of risks including erosion, flooding, and changes to stream hydrology. Participants were less certain about long-term risks from degraded streams. The primary risks mentioned included losses in wildlife and recreation opportunities. Threats to stream structures and functions (e.g., loss of flood attenuation and nitrogen processing) were less well understood. Perceptions of risks to recreation, wildlife, and health as well as benefits including aesthetics are important for the internalization of a threat. Barriers to recognizing a threat included a benign neglect of streams and the high costs of streamside land management. Decisions faced by landowners included ditch maintenance, how to reduce the impact of lawn care practices, maintaining stream flow, and property access. Stream restoration decisions focused on bank stabilization and were complicated by a lack of understanding of responsible parties and laws and regulations. A few landowners restored streams by creating riparian buffers and were influenced by environmental values and outreach and education from the Franklin Soil and Water Conservation District. Desired outcomes of decisions included a functional property, equity, and sustainable business and industry. Sustaining actions to restore and protect stream health often involved both continued education and community support. The greatest gaps in experts' understanding of influences on streamside landowner decisions appeared to be their understanding of the time and costs involved in maintaining streamside property and the salience for participants regarding losses in recreation and aesthetics due to impaired stream health. For participants the biggest gaps in their mental models, when compared to experts, appeared to be in their understanding of ecosystems and the importance of stream structures and functions as well as what organizations were responsible for stream health and how to contact them.

AB  - Grassland birds must have accessible, nutritional prey for nestlings which Conservation Reserve Program practices like CP33--Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds may provide. In 2008-2009, I monitored dickcissel nests in and around CP33 buffers at a farm in north-central Mississippi using video cameras to capture provisioning activities. I simultaneously observed foraging flights and measured distances traveled from nests. Orthopterans were the most commonly chosen prey, and dickcissels brought larger prey items when chicks were older. But, other changes in provisioning were not significantly related to nest age as I hypothesized. Also contrary to my initial hypotheses, provisioning at nests within buffers did not differ from non-buffer nests. CRP grasslands were equivalent to other available habitats. Provisioning rate and biomass decreased when an observer was present, and male feeding increased provisioning rate. Incorporating native warm-season grasses through conservation programs can increase nesting and foraging resources for dickcissels.

AB  - Raptor abundance and diversity were compared between 4 treatments (grassland, shrub/pole, fragmented forest, and intact forest) over 3 seasons (migration, summer, and winter) on 3 mountaintop/valley fill mines in southern West Virginia. Habitat characteristics of Red-shouldered Hawks ( Buteo lineatus ) were examined at landscape and microhabitat scales. Forty-eight points were surveyed monthly (Feb. 2000-Jan. 2001) using broadcast calls. I quantified microhabitat characteristics within an 11.3 m radius plot and landscape characteristics within 1000 and 564 m buffer zones at each point. Abundance was highest in grasslands; richness did not differ among treatments. Overall, I detected a shift from a forest to a grassland raptor community. Red-shouldered Hawks were the most common woodland raptor species, occurring almost exclusively in the 2 forest treatments, particularly in the intact forest. Amount of wetland in the landscape was the key characteristic determining presence of Red-shouldered Hawks. Woody debris was positively related to their abundance.

AB  - Slash-and-bum milpa practiced by Mayan farmers in Northern Yucatan Peninsula has become unsustainable. Fallow period lengths have decreased to an average of 7 years. Slashing young forest continually affects biodiversity, soil quality and overall ecosystem function. An agroforestry system was designed which incorporated traditional agricultural methods while mimicking dry tropical forest ecology. The design was tested with WaNuLCAS software by carrying out comparative simulations of tree-crop combinations (simple agroforestry scenarios) and testing the overall viability of a complex agroforestry system. Hedgerows of Gliricidia sepium and/or Brosimium alicastrum added to the traditional milpa were found to increase productivity of maize in the initial years of growth, while crop rotations (with Mucuna pruriens [mucuna] and Manihot esculenta [cassava]) paired with hedgerows of both gliricidia and ramón were found to boost productivity and yield stability. Final recommendations for agroforestry design were made which were found to be robust to 15% less rainfall and +2 degrees Celsius. Keywords Maya, agroecology, agroforestry, alternatives to slash-and-burn, ecological modelling, WaNuLCAS, ecosystem services, dry tropical forest; yield stability; functional diversity.

AB  - In this thesis, microbial and biogeochemical analysis of a non-calcareous groundwater gley riparian zone soil (Loddon series, Shinfield Farm, Reading, U.K.) was conducted, in which the soil was subjected to waterlogging in both microcosms and mesocosms. It was hypothesised that the microbial biomass in a riparian soil would respond rapidly to the onset of anoxia caused by waterlogging, and that C dynamics would be dominated by members of the methanogenic Archaea. Total soil nucleic acids were extracted from field moist riparian soil and soil that had been waterlogged for 5 days in microcosms. The results showed that two non-thermophilic Crenarchaeotal phylotypes dominated the clone libraries generated from the riparian soil, with no members of the methanogenic Archaea recovered. It was proposed that 5 days was insufficient time to generate a sufficiently negative redox potential for methanogenesis to occur. In a longer term waterlogging experiment the Loddon riparian soil was subject to 35 days incubation in soil mesocosms. The results suggested no major change in the microbial communities over time induced by waterlogging. An assessment of the populations of anaerobic and micro-aerophilic bacteria in the soil using BIOLOG-AN plates and anaerobic respiration rates suggested a diverse and active population of anaerobes that respond rapidly to the onset of anoxia. N2O and CO2 respirations were evident, however trace amounts of methane were only measured in those gas-microcosms that had been amended with acetate. This confirms that although members of the methanogenic Archaea are present in these soils, they do not play an important role in cycling in this riparian soil over the 42 days that these soils were anaerobically incubated.

AB  - Understanding the conditions under which hillside farmers in Haiti adopt soil conservation practices helps programs to develop technologies that increase farmer revenue and stabilize or improve soil and water resources. Three studies were done in Haiti that examined biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of contour hedgerows, an agroforestry practice with the potential of stabilizing soil, conserving water for crops, increasing soil fertility, and producing wood and fodder. An on-station study of soil water competition between Leucaena leucocephala (Lan.) de Wit hedgerows and adjacent maize ( Zea mays L.) over three cropping cycles found that substantial maize yield reduction was caused by the hedgerow trees because of soil water competition. Polyethylene barriers between the hedges and the first row of maize improved maize yield in two subsequent seasons by 18% and 77% over plots without barriers. The percent increase in maize yield was highest during a season of very poor rainfall; but it was lowest in a season of adequate rainfall. Barrier installation reduced Leucaena biomass production by about 1,500 kg/ha over seven months, but this effect was temporary. An examination of the distribution of Leucaena roots after the final maize harvest showed that the hedgerow roots in the plots with barriers had grown under the hedgerows and developed more fine roots at 200 cm from the hedges than plots without barriers. An on-farm study comparing maize development in two kinds of hedgerows, rock wall terraces, and an untreated control was unable to detect differences in the rate of maize growth with respect to position within the alleys or with respect to position on the overall slope. However, the maize in the hedgerows developed more slowly than in the rock wall terraces or the control plot, indicating competitive interactions between maize and hedgerow plants. There were no differences in maize grain yield among treatments. An on-farm questionnaire-based survey of 1,540 Haitian farmers showed that they considered plot characteristics, including mode of tenure, soil fertility, distance from the residence, and slope in their decisions to install different agroforestry practices. Tenure security and soil fertility appeared to be the most important plot characteristics in the decision to install, although it was not possible to separate them. Hedgerows were more likely to be installed in plots having less secure tenure and less fertile soil; the opposite was true for other agroforestry practices. Farmers' qualitative assessments of soil fertility were positively correlated with management quality of hedgerows.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) is one of the best management practices that uses natural processes to remove a portion of the sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff before the water enters a water-body. The project analyzes the flow accumulation of runoff with the help of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The objectives for this project include (1) To determine the effectiveness of VFS by visual field observation and validation by flow mapping procedures in ArcGIS 9, (2) To compare the area ratios and percentage of flow along each stream segment at various resolutions for different sizes of the survey data sets, (3) Compare the flow routing for USGS 7.5 Quadrangle values and the collected data. This study is of great significance in regard to key water quality and surface runoff issues, which are gaining broad awareness while developing consciousness about effective management practices and good land stewardship values.

AB  - Conservation buffers provide wildlife habitat, erosion control, and water quality enhancement. However, producer perceptions of buffer communities as sources of weeds, pest insects, and lost production may inhibit adoption. To address these concerns, I examined effects of field borders on opportunity costs, yield, and weed density on 3 farms in the Black Prairie region of Mississippi from 2000-2002. Native herbaceous field borders are a buffer practice subsidized under a new Continuous Conservation Reserve Program practice, CP33-Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds. To characterize opportunity costs of CP33, I estimated average yields for corn and soybeans in relation to proximity to field margin and adjacent plant community (APC) types crop, herb, and wood relative to interior yields from 104 corn and 56 soybean fields during 2000-2003. Partial budgets were used to develop break-even analyses on profitability with and without CP33. Corn analyses showed an economic advantage at first combine swath (9.14 m wide) for all APC types, at swath 2 for herb and wood and for the whole field. Soybean analyses showed that for any APC and swath combination, enrolling in CP33 was not economically advantageous. To evaluate effects of borders on yield I estimated yield in combine swaths 2-11 (14.64-80.52 m) on 2 farms. Average yields did not change beyond 80.52 m from field edge. Border effects occurred at swaths 2-4 (14.64-29.28 m). Overall, border yields were less than no border yields; however, if borders were established as CP33, profit lost through yield reductions would be offset by incentive payments. Floristic and structural characteristics of field borders and APC were determined through measurements taken from 756 quadrats from 2000-2002 on 3 farms in Clay and Lowndes counties. APC species richness was twice that of the border. APC had 187 taxa and border communities had 102 taxa. Density data were analyzed for 10 weed species. Significant row effects occurred within treatments (border and no border) for Brachiaria platyphylla, Cynodon dactylon, Digitaria ciliaris, Ipomoea hederacea, Ipomoea lacunosa, Senna obtusifolia, Sida spinosa, Solanum carolinense, Sorghum halepense . Overall, weed density was greatest at row 1 and no significant effects occurred past row 2.

AB  - This research quantified the effectiveness of agricultural riparian buffers to protect stream health in Maryland's Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions. Easily-obtainable data were used to develop scientific guidance for buffer management strategies. Three data sets were used: the 1998 University of Maryland Agricultural Buffer Survey, the 1996 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center Water Quality Survey, and the 1995-1997 Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Collectively, these data were used to represent baseflow water quality and landscape conditions in agricultural catchments. A set of landscape characteristics describing the agricultural riparian landscape was developed, from which a classification system for agricultural riparian landscapes was developed. The Agricultural Riparian Classification System can identify a subset of sites for targeted research. Additionally, the distribution of agricultural riparian buffers was characterized. Although over 70% of sites were buffered, because the statewide average buffer width was approximately 49 meters, almost 50% of buffers could not be detected by remotely sensed data with a resolution of 30 meters. Models were developed to predict measures of stream health at a site. Buffers acted differently on instream nitrate concentration, fish IBI (FIBI), benthic IBI (BIBI), and instream physical habitat (PHI). All models indicated that nitrate source terms overshadowed any on-site buffer effects and that Confined Animal Feeding Operations and pastures acted as point sources, overwhelming non-point-source effects. Therefore, livestock best managements practices are critical for the reduction of nitrate to streams. FIBI, BIBI and PHI in the Piedmont region were unaffected by buffer presence, but BIBI and PHI in the Coastal Plain were affected by buffer presence, type and width. Regression tree modeling was able to delineate a range of minimum effective buffer width between 22-38 meters. All measures of stream health in Piedmont systems were controlled by hydrology and geomorphology. Therefore, insofar as buffers can mediate hydrologic effects on flow conditions in a stream, they may indirectly affect FIBI, and BIBI and PHI in Piedmont systems. Because FIBI was not directly affected by buffer presence, use of FIBI to measure success of buffer installation or restoration would give false results.

AB  - Twelve sites on ephemeral to perennial streams within eight agricultural watersheds in central Iowa were studied over a 20 month period (1980-1982) to provide a description of basic ecological structure and function of stream ecosystems in intensively managed agricultural watersheds. In addition, assessments based on the following key ecological indices were made to test the River Continuum Concept relating to headwater streams: water quality, detrital decomposition rates, primary production, and invertebrate trophic organization. The drainages were differentially modified by intensive row crop development, grazing, removal of riparian vegetation, channelization, tile drainage, and sewage plant effluent. The most agriculturally modified headwater streams did not display ecological characteristics typical of headwater reaches studied in other parts of the country nor did they demonstrate all functional changes hypothesized by the RC-concept. Unlike "typical" headwater streams, these open canopy agricultural streams displayed impaired water quality (e.g. high nutrient and suspended solid concentrations), very warm summertime stream temperatures, extremely high primary production and respiration rates, slow detrital decomposition rates, and generalist collector-scraper invertebrate assemblages. In addition, the highly modified agricultural streams displayed very large summertime temperature and oxygen fluxes over diurnal periods, summertime production-respiration ratios < 1, and invertebrate communities with relatively low diversities but high densities and biomass. Less modified, tree-lined streams functioned much like headwater sites studied elsewhere. Certain watershed, nearstream, and instream management practices such as grassed waterways, riparian buffer area protection against cropping and grazing, suspension of maintenance channelization, and conservation tillage could be employed as low cost alternatives to lessen some of the water quality impairments and ecological impacts associated with intensive agricultural land use practices currently employed in central Iowa. However, large scale long term watershed manipulation experiments will be necessary to demonstrate or predict quantitatively the effects of such mitigation measures applied to agricultural watersheds.

AB  - The research concentrated on two fronts: (1) defining relationships between land use complex and nitrate and sediment concentrations; and (2) developing a method for assessing the extent of potential and water quality improvements available through land management options and their associated costs. In this work, selected basins of the Fish River (Alabama) were delineated, land use/land cover types were classified, and "contributing zones" were delineated using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) analytical tools. Water samples collected from these basins were analyzed for their nutrient contents. Based on measured nitrate and sediment concentrations in basin streams, a linkage model was developed. This linkage model relates land use/land cover with the pollution levels in the stream. The linkage model was evaluated at three different scales: (1) the basin scale; (2) the contributing zone scale; and (3) the stream buffer/riparian zone scale. The contributing zone linkage model suggests that forests act as a sink or transformation zone. Residential/urban/built-up areas were identified as the strongest contributors of nitrate in the contributing zones model and active agriculture was identified as the second largest contributor. Regression results for the "land use/land cover diversity" model (stream buffer/riparian zone scale) suggest that areas that are close (adjacent) to the stream and any disturbances in these areas will have major impacts on stream water quality. The economic model suggests the value of retiring lands from agricultural land uses to forested buffers varies from $0 to \$3067 per hectare, depending on the types of crops currently grown. Along with conversion costs, this land value forms the basis for estimates of the costs of land management options for improving (or maintaining) water quality throughout the study area. The model also shows the importance of stream-side management zones, which are key to maintenance of stream water quality.

AB  - Private land management at the individual level strongly affects the sustainability of wildlife populations in the County of Parkland, Alberta. Landscape Ecology principles were used to develop a strategy for land management and planning, and, in doing so, facilitate maintenance of natural habitat for wildlife. Specific objectives included the identification of Landscape Ecology principles applicable to the County of Parkland; identification of existing habitat types and distribution patterns: assessment of habitat availability and suitability for indicator wildlife species; and, identification of goals and strategies for habitat management within Landscape Units in the County of Parkland. Objectives were met using air photos from 1949 and 1987 to determine amount of land clearing in sample sections throughout the County. A Reconnaissance Vegetative Inventory within a GIS was also used to determine the available habitat and distribution pattern of coniferous forest, treed riparian areas, wetlands, shrub and deciduous areas, tall deciduous, and general upland vegetation. The County is an agriculturally dominated landscape. Although the County has the capability of supporting vegetative habitat and associated wildlife species ranging from grasslands through coniferous forest, the vegetation available is fragmented and scattered throughout the County. Four main types of areas of conservation interest involve riparian areas, wetlands, remnant forested patches and fencerows. More deciduous dominated forest exists in the County than coniferous forest and generally these remnant forest patches are associated with wetlands or riparian areas. The establishment of additional upland cover associated with the two wetland areas in Glory Hills and Banksiana moraine, and of riparian buffer zones along stream, creek and river corridors would make more habitat available for a greater diversity of species. Retention and enhancement of the remnant coniferous patches of habitat located in the western half of the County is desirable, as is the maintenance of remnant patches of shrub and tall deciduous habitat located north of Lake Wabamun, and along the Pembina and North Saskatchewan Rivers. Since most of the land in the County is under private ownership, landowner cooperation is necessary for habitat retention and enhancement. Individual habitat retention agreements should also be pursued by Fish and Wildlife Services along stream and creek corridor, and adjacent to wetland areas. A conservation program should be established in the County, along with a land stewardship program.

AB  - Long-term studies have indicated major declines in herpetofauna communities in the United States. One activity that has drawn particular attention is forest management. While some studies have suggested that timber harvesting is a major factor contributing to this decline, others indicate that negative impacts are temporary, as buffer zones or corridors may maintain species richness within herpetofaunal communities. The objective of our study was to determine the value of corridors to herpetofauna in managed forest landscapes in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. A 100-m wide unharvested corridor was left across each of three 20-ha harvest sites. A 1-ha enclosure was placed in each of the three corridors and within an unharvested 20-ha control area. Two standard drift fence arrays were located in the harvested areas on each site as well as in the unharvest control. Pre-harvest (January 1997 through December 1997) monitoring from the four intensively managed Pinus taeda plantations found 49 species and 4,147 individuals. Chi-square analysis revealed no significant difference in the number of species captured between sites. Analysis of variance detected no difference for the number of Anura, Testudines, Lacertilia, and Serpentes captured between treatments. The number of Caudata bordered on significance between sites (F = 15.79, P = 0.057), with the control site harboring more individuals. No significant differences were detected in habitat variables between sites. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the number of Caudata was positively correlated with coarse woody debris (r = 0.98, P = 0.01). Post-harvest monitoring (May 1998 through December 1999) identified 59 species and 15,747 individuals using these sites. Analysis of variance detected no difference for the number of Anura, Cau data, Lacertilia, Testudines, and Serpentes moving into or along corridors. No significant differences were detected in pre- and post-treatment species diversity and evenness indices for corridor habitats. No significant differences were detected in recruitment for Anura and Testudines. There was an increase in recruitment of Caudata on the treatment sites (F = 13.49, P = 0.05). Estimates of survival indicate no significant differences between the control and treatment sites. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Millions of dollars are spent annually in the United States on the installation of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are intended to protect water quality and conserve soil. Extensive research has been done to understand what motivates farmers to install BMPs but no work has been done to understand what motivates farmers to maintain BMPs after installation. This dissertation examines BMP adoption and maintenance through a three-stage process. First, a statistical meta-analysis of both published and unpublished BMP adoption literature was conducted. The following variables were identified as having the largest impact on adoption: access to and quality of information, financial capacity, and being connected to agency or local networks of farmers or watershed groups. This study showed that various approaches to data collection affect the results and comparability of adoption studies. In particular, environmental awareness and farmer attitudes have been inconsistently used and measured across the literature. This meta-analysis concludes with recommendations about the future direction of adoption studies, along with guidelines for how data should be presented to enhance the adoption of conservation practices and guide research. The variables that were identified in the meta-analysis served as a starting point for the development of a questionnaire to assess the social dimensions of BMP maintenance. This questionnaire was used to survey landowners who installed BMPs between 1990 and 2005 through the Nonpoint Source/Total Maximum Daily Load (NPS/TMDL) branch of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). Simultaneously, a BMP assessment was developed which used ArcGIS and aerial images to remotely inspect the condition of these BMPs. Based on intercoder reliability scores, this method proved to be a consistent approach to BMP evaluation. The remote assessment evaluated all 595 vegetative BMPs installed through the IDEM's 319 programs since its inception in 1990 to 2005. The results showed that most of these BMPs are in acceptable condition or better. Only grassed waterways and riparian buffers had median scores below acceptable. Eroding streambanks, rather than improper maintenance, appeared to cause many riparian buffers to fail. The results demonstrated that remote assessment of BMPs is a quick yet reliable approach that will allow for regular inspection of BMP condition. In the final analysis, results from landowner surveys and the remote BMP assessment were combined for statistical analysis. The findings highlight the importance of local organizations for disseminating information and educating landowners about the importance of BMP maintenance. When these organizations assist with upkeep and maintenance, however, the results are mixed. Local groups are proficient at assisting with the maintenance of active-field BMPs, but require further training before they will be able to help landowners with the upkeep of fallow-field BMPs. Many of the constructs that had a positive influence on fallow-field BMPs had a negative impact on active-field BMPs, and vice versa.

AB  - Tomato spotted wilt virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Tospovirus, TSWV) is the causative agent of the disease, tomato spotted wilt (TSW), which affects many crops including tomato, pepper, peanut, and tobacco. The tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, is considered the most important early season vector in North Carolina, and the western flower thrips, F. occidentalis, is considered an important vector when found in abundance. F. fusca and F. occidentalis disperse from winter annual weeds to summer annual weeds and crops in spring. Regional temperature and rain can explain the majority of variation in numbers of thrips captured on sticky traps; however, the numbers of thrips captured from nearby farms that experience similar weather are often variable in magnitude, and model validation attempts for individual farms yielded inadequate predictions. The importance of field and field margin characteristics were studied to better understand thrips and TSWV dynamics on a farm scale. Specifically, the effect of pepper plant age on TSWV prevalence, the effect of weed management on timing and magnitude of F. fusca dispersal, the relationship between F. fusca captures and TSW prevalence with distance to weedy margins, and the plausibility of secondary spread of TSW within tomato and pepper fields were studied. Based on regression models of percentage of pepper plants infected with increasing age, the predicted percentage of infected plants was reduced by 50% within nine days post transplant compared to plants infected at transplant, indicating that the timing of TSWV spread to pepper relative to plant age is critical. Management type and timing of winter weeds affect F. fusca dispersal magnitude and duration. Herbicide application increased F. fusca dispersal compared to untreated plots, but disking did not increase dispersal. Furthermore, more F. fusca dispersed from weeds that were managed at a late date compared to an untreated check, and elevated dispersals lasted longer from late managed weeds than from early managed weeds. Using a grid of sticky traps over bare soil, it was determined that F. fusca can disperse for hundreds of meters from weedy margins, the closest source of F. fusca. It was hypothesized that a greater abundance of F. fusca and TSW prevalence would be observed with increasing proximity to natural weed hosts; however, increasing numbers of captured F. fusca and increasing TSW prevalence with increasing distance from weeds were observed. Clustering of F. fusca captured and TSW prevalence was observed in all fields and generally reflected relationships observed using regression analysis. Sticky trap, foliage, and blossom data from tomato and pepper fields indicate that F. fusca are transient and do not establish resident populations within the fields, but F. occidentalis does colonize at least some fields of both crops. Transmission assays using thrips vectors collected from within the field indicate that some F. occidentalis acquire TSWV from infected plants within the field and are competent vectors, potentially contributing to secondary spread. Regression models for tomato provided evidence that secondary spread of TSWV occurs. Overall, results indicate that management of neighboring weed hosts of thrips vectors is unlikely to prevent TSW primary spread due to the ability of F. fusca to move long distances across a field, but care can be taken not to increase thrips and TSWV exposure, especially if management would increase thrips dispersal when plants susceptible to TSWV have been recently transplanted. Additional work to understand whether controlling resident populations of F. occidentalis in tomato and pepper fields reduces late season TSW and increases marketable yield is warranted.

AB  - Sessile organisms like plants must contend with variable environments. Phenotypic plasticity may allow plants to survive and reproduce successfully in variable environments. This research focused on the extent to which phenotypic plasticity is an adaptation to variable environments and the extent to which plasticity exerts a fitness cost, therefore constraining evolution. I also addressed whether the evolution of adaptive plasticity may be constrained by lack of appropriate genetic variation. I conducted these studies using Geranium carolinianum , an herbaceous annual that inhabits sites with striking differences in spatial variation for light. To address whether phenotypic plasticity has an adaptive benefit or exerts a cost, I conducted field experiments where I grew plants in tree shade, neighbor shade environments, as well as high light. Plasticity for petiole and internode length in response to tree shade enhanced fitness across light environments. At a wood-margin site, a benefit of plasticity was found for the response of petiole length to neighbor shade. However, at an old-field site, selection favored similar petiole lengths in two neighbor environments, therefore reduced plasticity confers a benefit. Plasticity did not bear a cost, either within or across light environments. The fitness of families plastic for petiole length and families fixed for petiole length was similar. Variation in the adaptive benefit of plasticity across sites contributes to the observed population differentiation for plasticity between wood-margins and old-fields. However, the evolution of plasticity within populations depends on genetic variation for plasticity. To measure family x light interactions and cross-environment genetic correlations within four G. carolinianum populations, I conducted a greenhouse experiment using two light environments. Positive cross-environment correlations for petiole and internode length in three populations may facilitate the evolution of plasticity because they are in the same direction as selection within environments. The evolution of plasticity is constrained in one of the wood-margin populations due to a negative cross-environment genetic correlation. This constraint will thus contribute to population differentiation for plasticity. Studies like these that compare a number of populations for plasticity and that use a range of different light environments considerably advance our understanding of the evolution phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Shelterbelts were established in the Canadian Prairies as a means to protect soil from wind erosion. Knowledge gaps remain about shelterbelts' ecosystem services to the agro-landscape, hence hiding farmers' trade-offs in a changing agriculture. This research first investigated shelterbelts' effect on soil biological activity and fertility. Soil samples were collected in September 2012 from sheltered and non-sheltered fields in the Rural Municipality of Stanley, Manitoba. Results showed that shelterbelts promote higher soil biological activity, potentially correlated to the enhanced organic matter and micro-climate adjacent to shelterbelts. A survey was then conducted to explore shelterbelts' cultural services to the local community. Results indicated that while shelterbelts were perceived to significantly benefit community well-being, they were mainly recognised for agricultural functions. We conclude that shelterbelts are a significant element of both supporting and cultural ecosystem services, contributing to the prairie agro-system resilience. Further research and quantification of shelterbelts' socio-ecological services is recommended.

AB  - The ecology and vegetation of Sierran meadows has remained largley unknown until recently. This project is designed to develop an ecological understanding of southern Sierran subalpine meadow ecosystems utilizing a plant community analysis. To achieve this, many studies were undertaken, four of which are reported here. (1) Sierran subalpine meadows in the upper Kern River Drainage are classified based on their physiographic characteristics. Two main divisions are recognized: meadows with predominantly vegetated margins (Type I), and meadows with predominantly sandy margins (Type II). Meadows of both types occur in a variety of topographic positions. Geographic distribution, sandy margins, hydrology, and geologic stability of the various meadow types are discussed. (2) The vegetation of seven subalpine meadows in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, was classified into 19 plant associations. The Braun-Blanquet releve method was used to collect percent cover data for each vascular species present in a stand. A species-stand matrix was formulated using a modified Ceska-Roemer program for association analysis. The plant associations and the environments in which they occur are described. (3) Releves from subalpine meadows in the Sierra Nevada are analyzed using polar ordination. Braun-Blanquet associations from the tabular association analysis of the same releves are plotted on the ordination diagrams forming easily recognizable units. The distribution of the associations along compositional gradients is found to be similar in both the ordination diagrams and association table. This suggests that polar ordination and tabular association analysis are complementary methods in the study of vegetation. (4) It is often assumed that meadow ecosystems are fragile and temporary phenomena. An alternative hypothesis is that meadows are as stable over time as the surrounding vegetation. A review of evidence from palynological, stratigraphic, and successional studies on Sierran meadows supports the latter hypothesis. The evidence for this simplistic hypothesis suggests three new working hypotheses on the causes of change in meadow ecosystems.

AB  - The main objective of this thesis was to examine the relationship between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and dietary nitrate intake from both drinking water and food sources in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada at the ecological level, and at the individual level in a case-control study. Historical data on ground water nitrate concentrations and land use patterns were utilized to examine temporal and spatial assumptions made in these two T1D studies. Ground water nitrate concentrations were assessed temporally, and the association between ground water nitrate and local land use was assessed spatially, comparing areal aggregation methods. The relationship between average nitrate concentration in ground water and T1D incidence at the watershed level was assessed, taking into account the population-at-risk and average household income. A case-control study compared drinking water chemistry, food frequency and average dietary component (e.g. nutrients) consumption between patients diagnosed with T1D during a four year period, and their age and sex matched controls, with an emphasis on nitrate concentrations and its derivatives. Some environmental and genetic-based factors were evaluated and controlled for where appropriate. Average monthly values in nitrate-nitrogen concentration for 54 wells across PEI over a three year period ranged from 3.80 mg L-1 in April to 4.08 mg L-1 in January, and annual values ranged from 2.12 mg L-1 in 1987 to 2.73 mg L-1 in 1983 for 167 wells over a 16-year period, with monthly measurements significantly differing over time. Local land use had a major influence on average nitrate concentrations: agricultural areas, particularly where row-crops grew, had higher nitrate concentrations than both residential and 'pristine' areas, and this was somewhat dependent on season. Specifically, potato, grain, and hay land coverage were significantly and positively related to average ground water nitrate concentrations (compared to 'pristine' areas), regardless of method of data aggregation. Blueberry land coverage was negatively associated with ground water nitrate concentrations using two of the three aggregation methods. Watersheds were the preferred method of nitrate aggregation at the area level when compared to freeform polygons and 500 m buffer zones around each well, due to the method of creation (hydrological boundaries), being large enough to accurately determine average nitrate concentration, and being able to explain the most amount of nitrate concentration variation. The results from these historical data indicate that the assumptions made in the T1D incidence and risk studies were valid: there were minimal temporal differences but substantial spatial differences in ground water nitrate concentrations. The incidence of T1D at the watershed level was not associated with ground water nitrate concentrations either before or after adjusting for average household income (a proxy for socioeconomic status), but a weak trend of higher nitrate concentrations being positively associated with T1D risk was present, especially after controlling for average household income. A case-control study comprising of 57 T1D cases and 105 controls, matched by age at diagnosis and sex, concluded that the risk of T1D was increased when regular soft drinks or eggs were consumed at 'least once per week', compared to 'less than once per week'. The intake of dietary nitrate was marginally significant and positively associated with T1D ( p = 0.13). An increased intake of total carbohydrates and caffeine were also associated with an increased risk of T1D, whereas the increased intake of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, and zinc were associated with a decreased risk. A family history of T1D and having five or more infections during the first two years of life significantly increased the risk of T1D, whereas residential remoteness was associated with a reduced risk of T1D. Father's education was also related to the risk of T1D, but the direction of the relationship was n t clear. In summary, ground water nitrate concentrations in PEI were influenced by local land use more than temporal factors. Nitrate from food had a marginally significant dose-response relationship with T1D risk at the individual level, and T1D incidence was positively but not significantly associated with nitrate concentrations in ground water at the area level. Other environmental and dietary factors had a greater influence on T1D risk at the individual level.

AB  - In this study I propose a statistical model, the Riparian Nutrient Attenuation Model (RNAM), designed to quickly and accurately access the nutrient attenuation capability of riparian buffer zones. This information may help land managers evaluate riparian systems in terms of their capacity to retain nutrients. Developed using data available in the literature, RNAM uses three physical properties of the riparian, including vegetation type, slope, and width, to estimate the retention of total N, NO3- and P. Three RNAM sub-models, RNAM-nitrogen, RNAM-nitrate and RNAM-phosphorus, were developed to handle each of the three nutrients. In developing RNAM, the relationships between the predictor variables and nutrient retention were examined. A preliminary test of RNAM indicated that each of the sub-models is capable of producing reasonably accurate estimations of percent nutrient reduction. RNAM-nitrogen, however, produced inconsistent estimates of nitrogen reduction at higher levels. More data is needed to calibrate and validate RNAM.

AB  - Riparian areas are transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The riparian areas investigated in this thesis are transitions between row-cropped uplands and lower order streams. Riparian areas can serve many functions such as filtering pollutants from overland flow, stabilizing stream bank, storing surface water and sediment, and maintaining biodiversity by providing wildlife habitat. In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands from agricultural to conservation uses. Soil conservation and water quality are two important riparian functions that were investigated in the first study which measured stream bank erosion. This study was conducted in NE Missouri on stream reaches with different riparian land use/vegetation. The second study focused on the enhancement of wildlife habitat in riparian areas. It compared avian communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The results of the bird survey support the establishment of designed riparian buffers including trees, shrubs, and/or grass to increase habitat for many bird species in highly modified landscapes such as the agriculturally dominated Midwest. However, the results of the stream bank erosion study did not show that natural perennial vegetation (trees and shrubs) was reducing stream bank erosion in northeast Missouri. Riparian areas are complex and much more research is needed to understand how to utilize and improve their natural functions.

AB  - The phenology of emergence, flight, and oviposition of the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham, was studied in eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. Life tables were prepared for two generations of C. hospes in a sunflower field. In addition, the morphology of fifth instar C. hospes was described. The phenology of C. hospes emergence and flight activity varied among years, and peaks in both emergence and flight activity usually occurred 1-3 days after rains. C. hospes appeared approximately one week earlier in pheromone traps than in windowpane traps. Densities of C. hospes adults in the interior of fields remained low throughout the oviposition period, but densities of adults in weedy vegetation along field borders were highest when oviposition activity peaked. Life tables were prepared for the 1986-87 and the 1987-88 generations of C. hospes. Total mortality from egg to fourth instar in capitula was 8.9% during 1986-87 and 22.1% during 1987-88. Mortality in capitula was due primarily to egg predation by Orius tristicolor (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and desiccation of first instars on involucral bracts. Mortality of eggs and larvae in capitula was positively correlated with egg density during 1987-88. Total mortality of overwintering fifth instars was 82.0% during 1986-87 and 67.0% during 1987-88. Approximately 40% of the hibernacula of overwintering larvae were killed by predators, primarily ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). The parasitoid Glypta (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) killed 7.0% of overwintering larvae during 1986-87 and 13.5% during 1987-88. Winter mortality was 11.4% during 1986-87 and 2.0% during 1987-88. Pupal mortality was 92.5% during 1986-87 and 84.7% during 1987-88 and was due largely to predation and Glypta. parasitism. The life tables illustrate the importance of egg predation by O. tristicolor, parasitism of larvae and pupae by Glypta, and predation of overwintering larvae and pupae by ground beetles in reducing populations of C. hospes.

AB  - Within some insect populations the abundance of individuals persists at extraordinarily high densities, while other populations are consistently sparse. To understand what drives these differences ecologists have often focused on extrinsic factors such as predation and environment. My research explores how intrinsic factors, such as oviposition preference and offspring performance, are related to population abundance of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Plutellidae). First, I examined whether preference for particular food plants is modified by the presence of alternative plant species. I measured oviposition preferences of P. xylostella using choice and no-choice assays. Moths given a choice exhibited more distinct preferences than those exposed to only a single plant. Using different preference assays can affect interpretation of preference patterns and diet breadth. Second, I tested whether population growth and plant use traits were correlated with field density of ten P. xylostella populations. Most performance traits did not correlate with population abundance, but ovipositional diet breadth was slightly broader among populations that persist at high densities. Third, ovipositing P. xylostella often prefer poor quality plants. Using a simple demographic model, I demonstrated that mortality during adult movement may favor the evolution of weak preferences. Finally, I tested whether plant use traits can affect insect abundance in the field. I repeatedly sampled cabbage plots with and without candytuft (Iberis umbellata) borders. I found many predators on candytuft, but few on cabbages. Further, there were fewer butterfly (Pieris rapae) eggs on cabbages near borders, apparently because candytuft disrupted butterfly oviposition behavior. Overall, plant use traits did affect population abundance on a local scale. Generally, plant use traits were weakly correlated with population density. Although much research has examined the role of extrinsic factors in population abundance, I found that extrinsic factors, such as the presence of additional food plants, mortality associated with movement, and the presence of vegetative borders, can also influence plant use traits. My findings indicate that to make evolutionary sense of plant use traits, ecologists must consider these traits in the context of extrinsic factors.

AB  - In this thesis I examined three important ecological questions to understand the role of forest management disturbance on unmapped small stream riparian plant communities: (i) how do small stream riparian plant communities respond to forest harvesting and site preparations? (ii) How do species diversity - functional diversity relationships vary in disturbed riparian and disturbed upland habitats? and (iii) Do riparian buffer reserves act as plant refuges in the clearcut boreal forests? In chapter 1, I answer the first question by reviewing and synthesizing published (searching ISI Web of Knowledge(TM) database) and grey literature. I found that small stream riparian plant communities are very poorly studied. Forest harvesting and scarification significantly reduce riparian plant species richness and diversity causing a shift from herbaceous to shrub dominance. I suggest that disturbance along small streams may facilitate the spread of invasive species into the streams that are protected by buffer reserve. I argue that the distribution patterns of plant functional traits might be useful as a predictor in developing an early warning system against habitat degradation. In chapter 2, I answer the second question by sampling naturally colonized plants along small streams in clearcut, clearcut plus soil scarification, riparian buffer reserve near clearcut, riparian buffer near clearcut plus soil scarification and uncut reference sites. Using 36 sets of functional traits as a surrogate of functional diversity, I test the effects of disturbance on species diversity - functional diversity relationships in two habitats: riparian and upland. I found that both species diversity and functional diversities reach their peak under moderate intensity of disturbance, producing a bell shaped disturbance-diversity curve. The disturbance-habitat sensitivity coupling has very little effect on overall diversity although the effect on particular life forms and functions may be significant. The novel finding in this study is that in natural communities, species-functional diversity relationships are linear in low intensity disturbance but this relationship shifts to curvilinear (quadratic) with moderate to high intensity of disturbance, due to uneven functional redundancy. This finding invokes that the current approach of conservation that predominantly relies on species richness needs to be reevaluated by considering plant functional traits. In chapter 3, I answer the third question by sampling plant communities around small streams in the clearcuts, the riparian buffer reserves around clearcut and in the uncut reference forests. I used a combination of trait based functional dichotomy and plant cover to predict plant colonization from the clearcuts to riparian buffer reserves. I found that riparian buffer reserves support more species than the clearcuts and the reference forests. In the trait display I was able to show that additional species in riparian buffer reserves were coming from adjacent clearcuts. This finding suggests that in the boreal forest, riparian buffer reserves act as refuges for plants, especially in the early stages after clearcutting. This finding invokes that careful management of riparian buffers may help in reducing the local extinction risk of many disturbance-sensitive plants.

AB  - This study aimed to identify management practices to enhance the biodiversity value of existing grass-only buffer strips on three farms in Southern England. An initial scarification to create germination niches was applied in combination with a wildflower seed mixture. The effectiveness of a graminicide (fluazifop-P-butyl) for controlling the competitive dominance of grasses at different rates and timings was also investigated. Responses of wildflowers and grasses, insect pollinators and spiders were monitored for up to four years after establishment. The combination of scarification, sowing and graminicide resulted in the highest cover, species richness and diversity of wildflower and greatest sward heterogeneity. The benefits of establishing sown wildflowers within the existing buffer strips were highlighted by the positive responses observed for both insect pollinators and spiders, and is likely to reflect greater foraging resources and prey availability respectively. A glasshouse study was also conducted to investigate pre- and post-emergent fluazifop-P-butyl applications on the wildflower species in the seed mixture and demonstrated no long-term effects following application at the recommended rates for buffer strips. The results of the field and glasshouse studies demonstrate that managing existing grass buffer strips with a combination of scarification, sowing and graminicide, can significantly enhance biodiversity. Further studies at a national scale are essential to convince farmers and policymakers of the widespread applicability and reliability of this approach. If this is achieved then incorporating these management tools into future agri-environment options could deliver benefits to pollinating insects, spiders and other components of biodiversity.

AB  - Field studies were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetative filter strips composed of switchgrass in conjunction with three different tillage systems: conventional tillage (CT), no-till (NT), and no-till with wheat residue (NTR) for reducing runoff volume, fluometuron and norflurazon in surface runoff. Total runoff was 59 and 53% less in CT and NTR, respectively, than in NT. Filter strips did not reduce total runoff volume. Across tillage treatments, cumulative fluometuron and norflurazon loss was reduced 35 and 36% when a filter strip was present, respectively. Fluometuron loss in the initial runoff event was 60 to 89% of the cumulative loss, which ranged from 3 to 16% of the amount applied. Norflurazon loss in the initial runoff event was 61 to 98% of the cumulative loss over the sampling period, which was between 1 and 10% of the applied amount. Filter strips lowered the rate of norflurazon loss in all tillage systems.

AB  - Grass barriers may be a potential alternative to vegetative filter strips for reducing sediment and nutrient loss in sheet and concentrated flow erosion. This study evaluates the effectiveness of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum ) barriers, traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea ) filters strips (FS), and native species filter strips with barriers (Native-FS) for reducing runoff, sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on a Mexico silt loam (Vertic Aeric Epiaqualfs) under sheet and concentrated flow. Grass barriers (0.7 m long) were established below 1.5- by 8-m long plots (sediment source areas) under continuous cultivated fallow and above 1.5- by 8-m long filter strips (FS). Soil berms treated with anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) at a rate of 9 kg ha -1 , and then covered with geo-textile fabric (GF) were used as plot borders. Two treatments had an artificial channel in the source area to simulate concentrated flow erosion. Supplemental inflow rates up to 12.5 L min-1 were added at the top of the plots of the concentrated flow treatments to simulate larger source areas under dormant barriers. Runoff produced from simulated rainfall at 66 mm h-1 was sampled at 1 m above the downslope edge of the sediment source area, and 0.7, 4, and 8 m below the source area to measure sediment, N, and P concentrations with distance. Under sheet flow, barriers and fescue-FS at 0.7 m reduced runoff and sediment loss, but barriers reduced runoff 31% more and sediment 15% more than fescue-FS ( P < 0.01). Barriers also reduced organic N, NO3 -N, NH4 -N, particulate P, and PO4 -P more than fescue-FS (P < 0.01). Native-FS and fescue-FS were equally effective for reducing sediment and nutrient loss. Fescue-FS effectiveness increased with distance but >25% of runoff, ∼94% of sediment, and ∼78% of nutrient loss were reduced after 4 m of FS. A modified equation accounting for the runoff ponding above barriers explained >70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Under concentrated flow, active and dormant barriers above fescue reduced runoff 33% more than fescue-FS alone at 0.7 m ( P < 0.05). Barriers reduced sediment by 92% but fescue-FS reduced sediment only 72% ( P < 0.01). Fescue-FS reduced only 60% of sediment when the source area was doubled by adding inflow rates, but not in barriers. Barriers reduced more nutrients than fescue-FS except NO3 -N and PO4 -P. PAM and GF reduced soil loss from berms by 99%, indicating that berms can be an economical alternative to steel plate plot borders. Barriers and native-FS can be effective alternatives to fescue-FS for reducing sediment and nutrient loss in sheet and concentrated flow erosion while promoting wildlife habitat. Barriers can improve the fescue-FS performance for controlling sediment and nutrient transport.

AB  - The research involves an interdisciplinary investigation of terrestrial ecosystem regeneration, from ecological and socio-economic perspectives, in the dry forest of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The dry forest has been extensively cleared and the land has been used predominantly for agriculture and livestock production. The Costa Rican government is seeking to restore forest cover on privately owned agricultural and pastoral land, by providing incentives for forest conservation and reforestation. An analysis of a government incentive mechanism, known as Payment for Environmental Services (PES), which recognises biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, ecotourism and hydrological services and encourages agroforestry, forest protection and plantations, lies at the heart of the research. The penetration of PES in the research area was found to be 21%, despite strong environmental consciousness and awareness. Attitudes towards the institutions involved were negative. Those receiving payments complained of a reduced and late payment. The ecological dimension used bioindicators of birds and butterflies to evaluate the conservation value of the incentivised land uses, and under which environmental characteristics they were favoured. Statistical analysis determined the variability of bioindicator responses (abundance, richness and diversity) across habitats over the two seasons. A carbon analysis evaluated the habitats in terms of carbon storage. Recommendations involve making PES more attractive and transparent to the landowners, increasing the payments, reducing the transaction costs, increasing the length of the contracts, raising awareness, preventing the leakage of money, ensuring the payments are timely, mixing the PES habitats, using native species and increasing the landscape heterogeneity and connectivity. Payments should target forests, live fences, trees in pastures and native plantations, notably, Madero Negro Gliricidia sepium and Pochote Bombacopsis quinata. Payments should also target the priority areas and buffer zones, especially the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.

AB  - The use of vegetative filter strips (VFSs) in the mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads from agriculturally derived overland flows is a widespread practice. VFSs have been used in a wide variety of situations to treat runoff from croplands, feed lots, dairy operations, confined animal feeding operations, and roadsides, among other locations. While vegetative matter must regularly be removed from vegetative filter strips in an effort to prevent them from becoming nutrient load sources, very limited attempts have been made (with the exception of biofuel harvesting) to harvest that biomass for a useable purpose. This dissertation examines the novel approach of establishing vegetative filter strips on the ends of surface-irrigated, row-cropped fields with commonly utilized forage species for the direct mitigation of suspended sediment and soluble nutrient loads in overland flow while concurrently producing a marketable forage crop. A review of the pertinent literature is provided followed by a detailed overview of the experimental setup. Five commonly utilized forage crops were used to establish vegetative filter strips of varying lengths on the ends of furrow-irrigated, row-cropped fields in an arid environment. Vegetative filter strips of 3.05 (10 ft), 6.07 m (20 ft), and 9.14 m (30 ft) in width were found to have removal efficiencies exceeding 99% for: total inflow volume, total suspended solids, NO 3 -N, NH4 -H, PO4 -P and total P while yielding marketable forage biomass at a rates roughly comparable to average yields from regional hay farms. Statistical analyses on mean removal efficiencies showed a significant statistical difference among the performance of VFS width and vegetation cover type for mean suspended sediment removal efficiencies, and among vegetation cover type for NH4-N mean removal efficiencies. No significant statistical difference was shown among either vegetation cover types or VFS width for mean removal efficiencies of NO 3 -N, PO4 -P or total P. NH4 -N removal among differing VFS lengths was shown not to be statistically different.

AB  - The Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) utilizes the Mehlich-3 P (M3P) soil test, and other parameters, to indicate the potential risk of surface and subsurface P losses to nearby waters from agricultural fields. The PLAT recognizes soil-dependent linear relationships between soluble P and M3P, and does not recognize the potential for a soil to become P saturated. Beyond P saturation, soluble P increases at greater rates per unit increase in M3P. While riparian buffers are an effective best management practice to attenuate surface P losses, limited documentation exists regarding the potential for riparian buffers to attenuate subsurface P losses via lateral transport. Our objectives were to validate the use of M3P and the M3P saturation ratio [P/(Fe+Al)) to predict P leaching in North Carolina coastal plain soils and evaluate riparian buffers for attenuating subsurface P losses from high-P fields. Coastal Plain soils that had received swine waste and represented various PLAT soil management groups and leaching potentials were selected for study. Field sampling grids consisted of three 73.2-m transects (18.3 m apart) with five cores per transect. Each transect consisted of three soil cores (168 cm deep) collected in the field, one at the field edge, and one 18.3 m into the buffer. Soil-dependent M3P saturation ratios (0.05 to 0.21) were proven indicators of P leaching, wherein P accumulated at depths in the profile exposed to the water table. Spatial interpolation of M3P saturation ratio data with depth across field sampling grids indicated the risk of subsurface lateral P loss was the least in mineral soils and greatest in organic soils. The proposed adoption of the M3P saturation ratio by the PLAT and the consequential impacts of its implementation will be discussed.

AB  - This research developed and applied a GIS-based modelling framework that integrated a hydrologic model and a farm economic model to examine the environmental and economic implications of land management changes in terms of potential crop rotation in the Fairchild Creek watershed in southwestern Ontario. Model simulations that incorporated annual object-oriented landuse/landcover classifications revealed that both sediment loads and cropping returns are variable across space and time and that these patterns are not comparable. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of sediment load to economic output ratios are relatively stable and concentrated in areas with high sediment delivery or low crop-based economic output. These results provide practical references for watershed management agencies to understand the spatial and temporal dimensions of the tradeoffs between environmental impacts of agricultural nonpoint source pollution and economic output. Therefore, based on identifying high damage to benefit ratios, decision makers may prioritize areas to implement agricultural conservation practices such as conservation tillage and riparian buffer strips.

AB  - This thesis addressed the potential of endemic predaceous and parasitic arthropods of the Hood River Valley, Oregon to suppress the pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola Forster. Natural enemies adequately suppressed psylla in three of seven unsprayed orchards of differing vegetational settings, orchard age, and size. Relatively few psylla natural enemies dispersed to unsprayed pear mini-orchards, despite abundant populations on surrounding noncultivated vegetation. Pear psylla natural enemies were more abundant on arboreal rather than herbaceous non-pear hosts. Selective programs of pear pest control based on diflubenzuron were moderately successful in controlling the pear psylla, with natural enemies aiding in suppression in six of fourteen commercial trials of selective programs. In both unsprayed and commercial pear orchards, late-season psylla densities appeared to be best suppressed when levels of natural enemies were high during early-season. Classification analysis confirmed that orchard site, chemical regime, type (mini- or commercial), and season affected proportions of natural enemies and their pear psylla prey. Complexes of natural enemies and pear psylla immatures from commercial orchards where biological control was successfully demonstrated was taxonomically similar. Effective natural enemy complexes in commercial orchards were characterized by earwigs, lacewing larvae, and moderate proportions of pear psylla immatures during early season and Deraeocoris brevis, earwigs, and lacewings during mid-season. Plagiognathous guttatipes (Uhler) or Diaphnocoris provancheri (Burque) dominated effective natural enemy seasonal complexes at each of two mini-orchards. The functional response to pear psylla eggs was measured for five predaceous mirids. Functional response parameters differed among species and their life-stages, but all destroyed large numbers of psylla eggs. Further experimental directions for the implementation of pear psylla biological control are proposed. General investigative strategies include: (1) augment natural enemies on non-pear vegetation adjacent to the target orchard, and (2) modify the orchard habitat to both encourage natural enemy colonization and allow permanent complexes of natural enemies to develop. Specific tactics include: plant hedgerows of filbert or willow, cultivate snakeflies, introduce Anthocoris nemoralis, adjust early season psylla densities with suitable timing and kind of delayed dormant sprays, using a more effective selective psyllacide, and reduce winter pruning to allow development of natural enemies which overwinter in the egg stage.

AB  - Wetlands and streams provide many ecosystem services, yet many of these services have been lost during the process of surface mining. It is often not practical to avoid wetlands and streams, and newer technologies such as large draglines have made it possible to mine through large perennial streams and their associated riparian wetland systems. Laws such as the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and Clean Water Act require the restoration of these systems in approximately the same location and configuration as before mining, but do not address the long-term replacement of function. In Perry County, Illinois, three stream segments of Bonnie Creek, Galum Creek, and Pipestone Creek and their associated riparian wetland systems were among the largest ever restored following surface mining. The research objective was to determine whether or not function was restored in the three aforementioned streams and riparian wetlands following surface mining reclamation. Wetland soil properties, vegetation, and hydrology at study sites along Bonnie and Galum Creeks were compared to that of nearby natural wetlands and across a chronosequence of soil age. Water quality was assessed [alkalinity, chloride (Cl), fluoride (Fl), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), nitrate (NO 3 ), sulfate (SO4 ), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS)] in the three restored streams for post restoration trends over time and along the length of the restored channels. Deep basins, called incline pits, were located inline of all three restored channels and are unique to streams restored on surface mines. Stream samples were collected above and below incline pits during storm events to evaluate their ability to reduce sediment concentrations. Assessment of the water chemistry of the restored streams showed that for some parameters, water quality remained stable or improved with distance or time along the restored streams. However, along Bonnie and Galum Creek, a significant positive trend was seen by length of relocated channel in SO 4 , Fe, Mn, Zn, TDS, conductivity, and Cl. On the other hand, at Pipestone Creek, significant negative trends were evident in TDS, Mn, water temperature, conductivity, and SO4 levels over time or along the length of the relocated channel. Trends along the length of the Pipestone Creek were only found in monitoring conducted twenty years after the channel relocation was complete. Sediment concentration above and below the incline pits inline of Bonnie and Galum Creek were not significantly different based on the sampling of two storm events. An additional input from an agricultural drainage ditch to the Bonnie Pit increased sediment concentrations at the downstream sample point counteracting the reductions that were seen in the Galum pit. Research on the mined stream and riparian systems indicated that reclamation of wetlands and streams to a stable or condition similar to a natural system is possible and sets a standard for future mining operations to follow. However, several shortcomings were identified. Reduced levels of SOM and soil N in the MPWs in the surface 15 cm of the lower sample points may have been the result of longer periods of inundation that reduced nitrification and vegetation recruitment. SOM, soil N, and the C/N ratio in the 15-30 cm depth were lower in the mined wetlands suggesting that these properties take longer to recover at deeper depths, but the significant linear trend in pH show that soil in the deeper strata is changing with time. Invasion by P. Australis reduced taxa richness suggesting that invasive plants are still a problem even more than twenty years after restoration. In addition, the increase in conductivity and SO4 downstream of a visible seep in Bonnie Creek highlight the potential for contaminated groundwater to affect surface water. More consideration should be given to reclaiming not just the surface and subsoils, but also the deeper water bearing strata to ensure that surface wat r chemistry is not impacted by mining.

AB  - This study examined bird and butterfly diversity in agricultural land and woodland in Irish lowland landscapes in Co. Laois and Co. Kildare. Similar studies have been conducted in Britain and other European countries but it was believed that the situation might have been different in Ireland due to the island status, the physical environment and history of landuse of the country, which have resulted in impoverished bird and butterfly faunas. In the breeding season, bird season richness and abundances were significantly different between the habitats studied: broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, pasture, set-aside and tillage. However, in winter this was not the case. The habitats differed in the bird species assemblages they contained both in summer and winter. Farmland habitats contributed more unique species to the total bird diversity, which probably reflects the lack of woodland specialists in Ireland. Farmland and woodland habitats did not differ significantly in terms of butterfly species diversity and abundance. However, this may have been due to the low numbers recorded. Individual species showed preference for different aspects of local habitat and vegetation structure including the presence of larval foodplants. The numbers of butterflies and species recorded were higher from transects placed along hedgerows compared to those in the middle of fields in the same farmland site. In lowland farmland in Ireland, bird species diversity in the breeding season was greater in set-aside compared to neighbouring farmland. The type of management of set-aside was important and determined which species were likely to be found using the set-aside field. The majority of field interior species including skylark, meadow pipit, pheasant and snipe showed a preference for non-rotational set-aside over rotational set-aside and the other management types.

AB  - Evaluating the impact of best management practices (BMPs) is a necessary component to ensure that BMPs are performing as intended. Studying the condition, effectiveness and water quality impact of BMPs is in its infancy. A sample of grassed waterways, grade stabilization structures, field borders, and parallel terraces, implemented during the Black Creek Project (one of the first large watershed demonstration projects to study the relationship between agricultural activities and the use of BMPs to improve water quality), were evaluated via physical inspection, watershed hydrology computer modeling and economic analysis. Evaluation techniques that estimate the current condition of a BMP based on visual inspection and comparisons to selected original design dimensions were developed. The evaluation tools were tested for validity using an expert panel approach and for reliability based on inter-rater correlation, and applied to a subset of structural BMPs implemented during the Black Creek Project. One-third of the BMPs no longer remain, while those that remain are in fair condition and are partially functional. The BMPs were represented in a watershed hydrology model to predict their long-term impact for reducing non-gully erosion and phosphorus losses. BMPs in varying conditions--good, fair or poor--were represented in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by modifying parameters that reflect the impact the BMP has on the hydrologic processes occurring in SWAT. BMPs represented in good condition reduced the sediment and total P yields from 1-31% more than BMPs in varying condition. The simulations incorporated land use change from 1975 to 2003, during which pasture increased and row crops decreased over time. Applying 2003 land use resulted in a 35-59% sediment reduction and a 25-29% total P reduction when no BMPs were implemented compared to the 1975 land use. An economic analysis was performed and identified some of the limitations encountered when performing a benefit-cost analysis for a conservation project. Soil erosion and phosphorus reductions predicted from SWAT were assigned a monetary value using off-site benefit estimates, fertilizer nutrient costs and water quality trading values. The benefits received from the BMPs did not outweigh the costs for implementing and maintaining the BMPs. A larger benefit-cost ratio was computed when accounting for cropping system changes, but was still less than one. A myriad of benefits pertaining to water quality, i.e. gully erosion, nitrogen reduction, wildlife habitat improvement, human and aquatic ecosystem health, downstream impacts, and intangible impacts, were not captured with the economic analysis because of an inability to assign a market value to a non-market good, water quality.

AB  - The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the ecological and social factors affecting the availability of food for brown hares (Lepus europaeus Pallas) inhabiting farmland. Although highly probable that hare population numbers are both limited and regulated by their food supply, and that food shortages occur in the late summer-autumn, apparent contradictions in the literature (regarding habitat and dietary preferences compared with the national distribution of high density populations) underline our scant understanding of the mechanisms of food limitation for this species. In this study, two geographically close sites of apparently similar habitat type were compared; one (MS) having a significantly higher density of hares than the other (WF). Detailed comparisons of habitat use, social interactions and the nutritional status of individuals at this site were employed to elucidate aspects of the functioning of the density dependent and independent mechanisms governing the availability of food. Compositional analysis of habitat selection indicated that home ranges are not located at random with respect to available habitat, but that hares appear to select for key habitats which are important on a year-round basis. Apparent preferences for crops may actually relate to the presence of patches of species-rich areas of wild plants (`feeding refuges'). Thus while woodland was selected for throughout the year at MS, the selection for cereal at WF in all seasons in which it occurred probably largely reflected the presence of adjoining conservation field margins, for at least some seasons. Although home ranges overlapped on a coarse scale, individual hares tended to be spatially segregated except during the breeding season. Home ranges may interleave on a finer scale. One female-female association continued over several seasons. Home range size was not influenced by differences in population density and habitat distribution between the two sites. As hares were observed to congregate in feeding areas during the summer, the effect of conspecifics on foraging success was determined.(D181940)

AB  - To address degradation caused by past anthropogenic actions (e.g., stream channelization, installation of dams and levees), stream restoration activities have occurred in the U.S. and worldwide with the goal of returning ecosystem functions and services. As the number of projects have increased, a divide between the practitioners and research scientists has developed. Issues of contention include methods used, lack of engineering rigor, and effectiveness of stream restoration, both individual projects and the entire practice. It is uncertain whether the large annual U.S. expenditures spent on stream restoration is justified. Previous evaluations have cast doubt that stream restoration actions, primarily form-based, are improving ecological functions and social ecosystem services provided by streams. The divide between the practice and the science must be narrowed, however first it needs to be understood. A mixed methods approach, using field investigations, an online survey and semi-structured interviews, was used to critically evaluate the practice of stream restoration at a regional-scale. The intention was to evaluate the entire stream restoration process, including design, regulatory, construction and monitoring processes. The research characterized 1) the general practice using online survey and interview results; and 2) individual case study sites using field investigations and interview results. Incorporation of qualitative methods led to new insights on stream restoration practice by considering practitioner perspectives and experiences. Based on interviews and the online survey, it was determined that WNY is not a site of innovation for SR, however inhibitors of innovation were identified. Major inhibitors included: 1) fear of failure/liability concerns; 2) poor communication between academic and practitioner circles; 3) poor riparian management practices and other space constraints; 4) inaccurate stereotypes (e.g., engineers as nerdy computer crunchers); and 5) local politics (e.g., NY being a home-rule state). Although not a hotspot of innovation, the WNY study also provided insights into the practice-science divide. One of the emerging themes is that "science" is perceived differently by different individuals. To narrow the divide, therefore, requires research scientists to do a better job communicating how they define science and disseminating research through mechanisms easily available to practitioners (i.e., mechanisms other than peer-reviewed journal articles and academic conferences). More communication and interactions are needed between different organizations, agencies, and individuals working on and/or researching streams as there some strong stereotypes that may be broken down if different parties were interacting. These interactions could especially ease tensions between engineers and biologists/field practitioners, allowing engineers to communicate liability concerns, which are shared with many non-engineers (e.g., SWCDs, NYSDOT) and the need for adding more rigor to the design process under present day constraints. It is also recommended that stream bank stabilization (river engineering) should be separated from stream restoration as both serve different purposes; this is especially important due to recent mitigation policy changes favoring stream restoration as a mitigation strategy. In addition, it is recommended that focusing on riparian and watershed restoration over installation of in-stream structures may ease some of the tensions stemming from liability concerns, but will require the additional hurdle of getting municipalities on board.

AB  - This case study evaluates the suitability of the Kansas City, Missouri Stream Setback Ordinance as a model ordinance that illustrates the integration of science and public involvement in an effort to achieve water quality protection. Nationally, there is a vast knowledge base on appropriate riparian buffer widths that can provide the scientific foundation many communities are looking for to legally and politically defend a riparian buffer program. Many communities are recognizing the economic value of protecting water resources for the benefit of public infrastructure, health, and community quality of life. The City of Kansas City ordinance meets multiple community objectives from stormwater management to recreation and wildlife habitat, while minimizing the impact to developable land. By taking an ecosystem approach to development of the setback ordinance, the City of Kansas City ordinance balances environmental, economic, and social factors. The City can conserve functional riparian forest buffers which can enhance and improve water quality, and provide habitats for wildlife and recreational opportunities for people, and in turn enhance quality of life within the communities that make up Kansas City. Implementation of the setback ordinance illustrates that Kansas City has taken a major step toward improving water quality and protecting other valuable resources that will require less economic input while providing greater social and environmental benefits. This study clearly illustrates the integral components community planners and decision-makers can use in the development of buffer ordinances that meet their ecosystem planning goals.

AB  - The aims of this study were (a) to survey the flora and vegetation in an area of the Kinsale hinterland, surrounding a major pharmaceutical plant at Dunderrow, in South Cork, (b) to use comparative analyses to identify any impacts of the pharmaceutical plant on the flora and vegetation in the immediate vicinity, and (c) to see if any elements of the flora or vegetation would prove to be appropriate monitors of pollution derived from such an operation.The Kinsale hinterland is predominantly agricultural, with a relatively low proportion (< 35%) of semi-natural systems. A total of 385 relevés were recorded in the semi-natural habitats, alderwoods (there were no well-developed oak or ash-elm woods in the vicinity), hedgerows, grasslands, soil damps, waste ground areas, laneways and trampled areas. The relevés combined with edaphic measurements provide a base-line for future studies of this nature in the region.The vegetation was classified according to the Braun-Blanquet method of phytosociology and assigned to the following classes: Plantaginetea majoris, Stellarietea mediae, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Rhamno-Prunetea and Alnetea glutinosae. The vegetation of soil dumps and waste ground areas is referred to Alchemillo-Matricarietum, Poo-Lolietum and Pastinaco-Arrhenatheretum. The vegetation of laneways and trampled areas is assigned to the Lolio-Plantaginetum, Ranunculo-Alopecuretum and Centaureo-Cynosuretum. The vegetation of grasslands includes the Lolio-Cynosuretum, Junco acutiflori-Molinietum sub-association of Trifolium repens, Valeriano-Filipenduletum and Filipendulo-Iridetum pseudacori. Hedgerow vegetation is assigned to the Primulo-Crataegetum, with subtypes identified on the presence or absence of woodland elements of the Corylo-Fraxinetum, Blechno-Quercetum and Osmundo-Salicetum. The alderwood vegetation is assigned to the Osmundo-Salicetum, with three sub-types comprising (a) typical alderwood, (b) mixed alder-ash wood and (c) disturbed alderwood.

AB  - Ecosystems in tropical regions are expected to experience substantial impacts related to human land use and land cover change in the coming decades. Freshwater ecosystems will likely experience a disproportionate impact relative to other tropical ecosystems. My dissertation research takes an interdisciplinary approach to examine interactions between humans and their environment in lowland tropical watersheds of Belize, Central America. I present results from a rapid assessment technique (Chapter 2) designed to estimate the intensity of impacts on freshwater ecosystems stemming from riparian zone land use practices. The technique provides an accessible, low-tech method for identifying river reaches experiencing high degrees of impact. Chapter 3 also examines riparian zone land use practices and focuses on the use of agrochemicals by small-scale Q'eqchi' Maya farmers. A high percentage of farmers in the Temash River watershed of Belize are cultivating corn within riparian zones and are using herbicides without adequate training. The continued use of herbicides in these riparian zone farms represents an emerging threat to both human and ecosystem health in the Temash River. Chapters 4 and 5 look at slash-and-burn agriculture (locally referred to as milpa ) in the Temash River watershed and its impact on soil nutrient dynamics (Chapter 4) and the loss of nutrients from terrestrial landscapes to streams (Chapter 5). In general, soil nutrients in the upper 10 cm are not significantly impacted by milpa. Plant-available nitrogen (as NO 3- -N) declines significantly in milpa fields and recovery to re-disturbance concentrations requires approximately 15 years, suggesting that 15 years is an ideal fallow period for milpa farmers in the Temash. In-stream nutrients in watersheds dominated by milpa are generally P-limited, as reflected in TN:TP concentrations. A seasonal flux of nutrients is exported from catchments at the onset of the rainy season but estimates for annual export of nutrients are similar to or less than other tropical watersheds.

AB  - Forested riparian buffers play an important role in modulating stream water quality, including temperature. Few studies have quantified the relationship between stream temperature and canopy cover in the climatologically distinct deciduous forests of the central U.S. Hydroclimate data were collected from two intensively instrumented stream reaches of opposite orthogonal compass orientation in a semi-karst watershed on the border of southern Missouri.s Ozark region, USA, during the 2010 water year. Data were compared to above canopy reference measurements to calculate an energy budget for each stream reach. Average leaf area index (LAI) during the year was 2.64 in the riparian zone adjacent to the E-W oriented reach, and 2.43 in the N-S reach riparian zone. Air temperature and relative humidity transect data analysis indicated that riparian microclimate was significantly different (α=0.01) from the stream edge 25 or 40 meters away for 3 of 4 transects. Average stream discharge was 0.15 m 3 / and 0.25 m3 /s within the E-W and N-S reaches respectively. Mean stream temperature was greatest in August and was 24.4 °C in the E-W reach and 24.0 °C in the N-S reach. Net shortwave radiation was the primary energy flux causing stream heating (average 44.7 W/m 2 for E-W reach and 46.8 W/m 2 for N-S reach). Results suggest that riparian management practices in Missouri should potentially be altered to include wider buffers (40 meters) with less thinning (density dependent on stream size and discharge) to maintain pre-harvest stream temperature regimes.

AB  - Merchantable timber was inventoried in 9 riparian zones (RZs) of 3 widths in sapling-class East Texas pine plantations. Present, discounted, and projected volumes and values of residual timber were determined. Average per acre volumes of wide, medium, and narrow RZs were 2542, 1438, and 337 board feet (Doyle) and 7.2, 8.2, and 4.6 cords, respectively. Average per acre values were $352.75, \$209.93, and $46.41, respectively. Interest rates for the growth of the trees from 1981 to 1989 ranged 3.7--23.5 for pine and 2.2--6.1 for hardwood. Average per acre net annual equivalents (NAE) of wide, medium, and narrow RZs were \$34.38, $20.46, and \$4.52, respectively. Stumpage values at time of harvest projected at 7% compound interest for 30 years ranged $10.66--\$3,547.54 per acre and for 80 years ranged $313.93--\$104,499.95 per acre. Average NAE of wide, medium, and narrow RZs were $18.99, \$11.47, and $2.57, respectively.

AB  - The lowbush blueberry (Ericaceae: Vaccinium angustifolium ) is native to North America. Insect pollination is required for fruit set and bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) are the most common and efficient pollinators. Growers rely on combinations of managed honeybees, commercially reared bumblebees and naturally occurring wild bees for pollination services. This study explores three main questions important for understanding wild bee communities associated with lowbush blueberry production. 1. What is the diversity and abundance of wild bees in Downeast Maine blueberry fields and what factors impact the bee communities? 2. Does the use of commercial bumblebees ( Bombus impatiens Cresson) impact wild bumblebee communities by contributing to the prevalence of the microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi ? 3. What economic contributions do wild bee communities provide to blueberry growers? This study documents 133 wild bee species found in 40 study fields, along with an additional six species from supplemental fields. Twenty-two of these species have not been previously recorded in Maine. Wild bee diversity fluctuates over the three study years with no evidence that farm management practices influence bee community structure. Wild bee abundance is negatively related to the proportion of blueberry cropland within 500 m of the field borders and positively related to the proportion of deciduous forest and cleared forest within 500 m. Based on a sample of 767 bumblebee workers caught over a two-year period, Nosema infection levels of 5.48% were recorded. Infection levels have no relation to the use of commercial Bombus impatiens colonies for pollination, providing no support for a pathogen spillover hypothesis. Populations of B. terricola (Kirby) show evidence of decline with a Nosema infection prevalence of 46.2%, a local trend which reflects nationwide patterns. Three fruit set measures, yield (kg/ha), and value of crop (dollars/ha) were recorded for the study fields. Fruit set, yield, and value of crop were positively related. Fruit set, yield, and value of crop were also positively related to the abundance of all wild bees, bumblebees, and honeybees recorded foraging in the fields. Wild bee and bumblebee activity influenced fruit set and yield measures with 2-8 times the impact of honeybees.

AB  - The goal of the Mississippi State University Extension Service (MSU-ES) is to improve the quality of life for all Mississippians. One specific group that agricultural change agents work with at the county level is beef producers. Grazing lands have received much attention over the last few years regarding environmental concerns and Best Management Practices (BMPs) for beef cattle operations. The adoption of these practices was voluntary during the time this study was conducted, however; adoption was highly encouraged by the MSU-ES and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). By knowing the level of adoption of BMPs that Mississippi beef producers have implemented, change agents can more effectively plan educational programming efforts for producers to better understand the importance of BMP adoption. The purpose of this study was to describe the adopter categories of Mississippi beef producers as determined by Rogers (2003) adopter characteristics generalizations based on their (1) socioeconomic status, (2) personality values and communication behavior, and (3) opinions. It also examined the correlations between the adopter categories to predict the level of the three BMPs being studied. The adopter categories were innovator, early adopter, early majority, late majority, and laggard. The three BMPs that were the focus of the study were rotation grazing, riparian buffers, and pasture renovation. The results of the study indicated that Mississippi beef producers could be correctly identified in the adopter categories. By identifying the adopter categories of the Mississippi beef producers and then examining the correlations among the variables, prediction of BMP adoption of rotational grazing and riparian buffers was possible. The relationships between MSU-ES agents and their programming efforts, as well as the relationships between NRCS district conservationist and their programs, were studied. Non-adoption, though not an adopter category, was also examined and the reasons for it were cited.

AB  - Land use and demographic changes of small, family farm households in agricultural areas of the Amazon Basin have led to dramatic modifications of the land cover and corresponding ecology of many areas, especially small streams. The objective of this work was to assess the links between small households, land use choices at several spatial scales, and the resulting outcomes for land cover and small streams in and near the city of Altamira, Brazil. Households were interviewed in 2005 and 2008 about property and riparian land management, agricultural land use, water use and management, demographics, and environmental values, and these data were analyzed together with classified Landsat satellite imagery and water chemistry data collected in 2008-2009 from twenty-five different streams draining watersheds of different types of land cover, including several with significant urban development. Across all scales of analysis, forest or advanced secondary forest regrowth (SS3) and pasture were the predominant types of land cover, while the predominant land use activities were cattle ranching and cacao production. Agricultural land use choices were strongly linked to several associated land cover types in different areas (e.g., pasture in properties, riparian areas, watersheds), but demographic factors were less clearly related. Most respondents also reported maintaining unused riparian areas on their properties, and riparian buffers for these properties had significantly larger percentages of forest, regardless of buffer size. Protection of water or land resources was the most common response for maintaining forested riparian areas. However, at the watershed level, younger respondents were associated with pasture, urban development, trash and pollution in streams, and stream water conditions indicative of human use (i.e., higher dissolved nitrogen (N) concentrations, higher water temperature, and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations). In contrast, older residents were associated with forest/SS3 in watersheds and stream water conditions indicative of less use (i.e., lower concentrations of many anions and cations, lower water temperature, and higher DO concentrations). Future management efforts should consider the spatial extent of the watershed when planning for forest conservation management and stream health, especially along riparian boundaries of streams that can serve to benefit and sustain aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is applied to agricultural cropland in the form of both organic and inorganic fertilizers. However, excess N, primarily in the form of nitrate-N (NO3 -N), within soil systems can be transported to surface water via various subsurface pathways such as groundwater recharge and tile drainage systems. Once in surface water, NO3 -N can promote eutrophication, and impact the oxygen carrying capacity of aquatic organisms. Establishing effective Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) for reducing NO3 -N loading to surface water systems requires an understanding of the primary modes of transport. The objectives of this project are to determine: (i) the relative contribution of the two primary subsurface pathways (groundwater recharge and tile systems) to NO 3 -N loading, (ii) temporal patterns in NO3 -N export from agricultural landscapes typical of the Annapolis Valley, and (iii) the role forested riparian buffer zones play in attenuating groundwater NO 3 -N loads. The research was conducted in the Thomas Brook watershed located in Kings County, Nova Scotia. The watershed is a 760 ha catchment consisting of agricultural, forested and residential land. A network of groundwater monitoring wells was installed in the forested riparian buffer zone and cropped area of a 9.6 ha corn field. The field is systematically tile drained and receives both organic (semi-solid dairy manure) and inorganic fertilizers. Monitoring of NO 3 -N export through both the tile system and groundwater was initiated in May, 2007. Results show that NO3 -N concentrations in the field groundwater wells range from approximately 4-9 mg L-1 while the concentrations in the riparian zone wells range from 0-3 mg L-1 , indicating the forested riparian zone is attenuating groundwater NO3 -N. The NO3 -N concentrations from tile drainage discharge range from 1 mg L-1 to 34 mg L -1 . The annual loading rates from the groundwater system and the tile drainage system were of similar order of magnitude. The total annual mass NO3 -N loading through the groundwater system was 418 kg and the annual mass NO3 -N loading from the tile drainage system was 292 kg. Temporal patterns in NO3 -N concentrations and loads were observed in the groundwater, tile water and surface water, with NO3 -N concentrations and mass loads being higher during the dormant season (November to May) than during the growing season (June to October). Results indicate that NO 3 -N is being attenuated in the riparian buffer zone. The riparian buffer zone removed, on average, 73% of the NO3 -N exported from the field. Results from isotopic analysis provided evidence that denitrification is occurring in the riparian buffer zone. However, an analysis of the chloride concentrations along the groundwater flow path indicated that dilution could be contributing to approximately 45% of the NO 3 -N concentration reductions. Results of this study have shown that annual NO3 -N loading rates through the groundwater system and the tile drainage system are of similar order of magnitude. Establishing and maintaining forested riparian buffer zones, and implementing BMPs to mitigate losses of NO3 -N through tile drainage systems, would both help reduce NO3 -N loading to the Thomas Brook.

AB  - The Somerset Moors, located 50 Km south of Bristol, England, are one of Europe's largest remaining lowland peat wetlands, supporting a diversity of rare plants. Changing agricultural practices, especially fertiliser additions, however, increasingly threatened the conservation value of this area. In response organisations such as English Nature have become involved in influencing agricultural practices in the Moors. Measures include the designation of areas as National Reserves, negotiation of management agreements with landowners and direct land purchase.A principal objective of the research presented in this thesis is to assess the effectiveness of these policies in reducing ditch eutrophication on King's Sedgemoor, and to identify the general relationship between agricultural practices and ditch water quality. Ditch water quality data, allied with management details for adjacent fields, was collected between August 1994 and February 1995. This indicated that the most severe eutrophication is associated with direct over land flow from farmyards and roads. Higher fertiliser use and underdrainage is also implicated. English Nature has successfully reduced ditch water solute concentrations within areas under their management; however, eutrophication has not been eliminated.Detailed hydrological and solute monitoring, between February 1994 and January 1995, indicated that within the National Nature Reserve, the main source of solutes is from upwelling nutrient rich groundwater. Exceptionally, high K+, Na+, Cl- and Mg2+ concentrations are found at depth within the peat. This is almost certainly due to the presence of an underlying horizon of estuarine clay at a depth of 5 metres. Ion exchange reactions caused by this are posulated to result in the observed increases in NH4+-N, and PO4-P. These groundwter soruces undermine the effectiveness of control measures such as buffer zones, and indicate that agricultural practices may be less important than anticipated in producing eutrophication within the National Nature Reserve. Raising ditch stages may, however, succeed in reducing this problem by limiting groundwater fluxes.

AB  - Streamside management zones (SMZ's), designed to provide riparian buffers between silvicultural activities and adjacent streams are a commonplace component of best management practices designed to maintain streamwater quality. This study evaluated SMZ effectiveness in maintaining aquatic habitat and aquatic communities in low-order perennial streams of the Upper Coastal Plain of Mississippi. Effects of three SMZ treatments were evaluated: (1) unharvested Reference, (2) maintenance of an SWZ adjacent to commercial clearcutting, and (3) commercial clearcutting with no SMZ. Streams without SMZ's showed consistent numerical, if not statistical, differences from Reference streams for temperature, canopy coverage, streamside cover, and number of macroinvetebrates, and number of fishes. In contrast, no differences were detected between Reference streams and those receiving SMZ's, suggesting that the SMZ treatment implemented in this study effectively maintained aquatic habitat, macro-invertebrate assemblages, and fish communities during the first year after treatment.

AB  - I studied gray partridge (Perdix perdix) ecology in north-central North Dakota during 1985-87. The primary goals of this study were to identify habitats important to gray partridge survival and nesting, and to provide baseline data on partridge ecology in North Dakota. I captured and radio-tagged 100 gray partridge, mainly during winter. Individuals were tracked by a vehicle-mounted telemetry system until August of each year. Home ranges, movements, habitat use, and survival were calculated by using the telemetry locations. Winter home ranges averaged 117 ha, and were larger than previously reported in North America. Important habitats used by radio-tagged partridge during winter were cereal grains, sunflowers, and farmstead/wooded areas. Differences in habitat use were noted among years, dates, and snow depth. Roadside observations of partridge habitat did not accurately reflect actual use by partridge during winter. Capturing and radio-tagging gray partridge during winter negatively affected short-term survival. Body weight at time of capture was the best predictor of winter and spring survival. Survival of males was lower than that of females during both winter and spring. Overall survival from capture to the beginning of the nesting season was 50%. The major cause of mortality during these seasons was predation by raptors, mainly the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). Roadsides were the most important nesting habitat. The best predictor of nest site availability in roadsides was presence of unmowed vegetation from the previous growing season. Available nesting cover was lower than in other areas. Home ranges and movements were smaller among partridge with young broods (0-2 weeks), than home ranges of radio-tagged partridge unaccompanied by broods. Young broods used crop fields, roadsides, shelterbelts, and idle areas whereas failed breeders used crop fields and fallow fields during summer. Gray partridge in North Dakota survive in intensively farmed areas by using annual crop fields. My study suggests that population levels are mainly influenced by limited nesting cover and adult mortality, rather than brood survival as has been found elsewhere.

AB  - Green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), is the most significant vector of the aphid transmitted potato viruses, Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) and Potato virus Y (PVY). Spatial distribution of M. persicae was described in seed potato fields following mid-summer colonization, and this information was used to evaluate targeted applications of insecticide. Remotely sensed imagery was used to construct theoretical models examining the influence of the landscape composition on PLRV and PVY incidence in seed potato. Post-colonization distribution of M. persicae was determined over a three-year period in production fields near East Grand Forks, Minnesota. More than 70% of the M. persicae detected in samples occurred within 18 m of the field edge. The distribution of M. persicae within the field was highly correlated with distance from the field edge and can be modeled using a two-parameter decaying exponential regression. Targeted insecticide applications for management of M. persicae were evaluated on seed potato fields by applying methamidophos to field borders. Mean number of M. persicae were reduced by 88% in the sprayed border sections compared to pre-treatment densities. The influence of landscape structure on incidence of PLRV and PVY was examined in 1999 and 2000 using multispectral Landsat-7 imagery of two locations in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. Landscape elements adjacent to seed potato fields were spectrally categorized into crop and noncrop habitats, digitally mapped and analyzed using logistic regression for their influence on PLRV and PVY incidence. Theoretical models found strong associations between PLRV and PVY incidence in seed potato fields and commercial potatoes, small grains, sugar beets, canola, fallow fields, bare soil within a field, and presence PLRV or PVY at first field inspection.

AB  - The response of foraging bumblebees to various restoration and management options for arable field margins is studied across a series of single and multi-site experiments. Bumblebee abundance is closely linked to flower abundance of suitable forage species, and to successional changes in availability of these both during the season and between years. Margins sown with a mixture of pollen and nectar-rich plants, such as Trifolium pratense, are shown to attract large numbers of bumblebees, including rare species. The analysis of pollen loads confirms contrasting forage plant preferences in Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris, adding important information to that from transect counts on the functional value of introduced flower mixtures for local colonies. Widespread uptake of the Entry Level Environmental Stewardship scheme could therefore have rapid and positive effects on some species, but more diverse native plant communities may be required to provide a longer-lived forage supply to a greater range of Bombus species and other pollinators. The thesis concludes that although the total area of suitably managed habitat required to sustain populations is large, current AES prescriptions providing a combination of widespread, low cost and more targeted, specialist options for habitat creation are likely to significantly enhance the quality of the agricultural landscape for bumblebees. Future success will require close links between policy markers and ecologists, between the management of farmed land and protected semi-natural grasslands across Britain, and regular monitoring of the effects of habitat restoration on rare and common bumblebees and their interactions with other components of agricultural ecosystems.

AB  - Declines in abundance and diversity of bumblebees ( Bombus spp.) have been linked to the loss and degradation of habitats as a result of agricultural intensification. This thesis aims to examine some of the causes of bumblebee declines in Britain, and to investigate methods of habitat restoration to reverse these declines within intensively managed agricultural landscapes. It provides the first comprehensive comparative studies of the value of different options within the agri-environment schemes (AES) for foraging bumblebees. Twentieth century changes in bumblebee forage plants are assessed using two national plant species datasets. A large proportion of forage plants are found to have declined in both range (at the 10-km scale) and frequency (at the 1-km scale), reflecting serious reductions in the quality of foraging habitats for bumblebees across the agricultural landscape. Grass species associated with nesting habitats did not in general experience such declines, although the structural quality of vegetation for nesting is likely to have been degraded. The response of foraging bumblebees to various restoration and management options for arable field margins is studied across a series of single and multi-site experiments. Bumblebee abundance is closely linked to flower abundance of suitable forage species, and to successional changes in availability of these both during the season and between years. Margins sown with a mixture of pollen and nectar-rich plants, such as Trifolium pratense , are shown, to attract large numbers of bumblebees, including rare species. The analysis of pollen loads confirms contrasting forage plant preferences in Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris , adding important information to that from transect counts on the functional value of introduced flower mixtures for local colonies. Widespread uptake of the Entry Level Environmental Stewardship scheme could therefore have rapid and positive effects on some species, but more diverse native plant communities may be required to provide a longer-lived forage supply to a greater range of Bombus species and other pollinators. The thesis concludes that although the total area of suitably managed habitat required to sustain populations is large, current AES prescriptions providing a combination of widespread, low cost and more targeted, specialist options for habitat creation are likely to significantly enhance the quality of the agricultural landscape for bumblebees. Future success will require close links between policy makers and ecologists, between the management of farmed land and protected semi-natural grasslands across Britain, and regular monitoring of the effects of habitat restoration on rare and common bumblebees and their interactions with other components of agricultural ecosystems.

AB  - Agricultural and conservation policies dictate that landowners adopt practices that achieve long-term environmental goals. There isa renewed focus on shelterbelts as a conservation tool as water quality regulations become more prevalent. Several state and federal programs provide financial and technical assistance for shelterbelt establishment. A farm-level agroforestry modeling system was developed to provide policymakers and farmers with information on the impacts that state and federal programs have on farm income and the environment. The modeling system is being used to determine the farm-level economic and environmental effects of agriculture and wildlife shelterbelt systems in eastern Nebraska, Two representative farms--a 700-acre dryland farm and a 1260-acre irrigated farm--were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Farm-Level Income and Policy Simulation Model (FLIPSIM), was used to analyze economic returns over a 50-year period under two different shelterbelt systems: agricultural and wildlife. A total of four crop yield scenarios were included. Policy parameters were examined as land removed from production under each system: (1) was enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program for a 15-year period; and (2) received state cost-share assistance for shelterbelt establishment. The economic results indicate that yield effects on row crops related to microclimate modification are more significant than the policy parameters. For both the dryland and irrigated representative farms, net cash farm income was higher under the agricultural shelterbelt scenarios than the baseline with no trees. Net cash farm income under the wildlife scenarios was lower than the baseline with no trees. Environmental analyses indicated there was little difference between the dryland and irrigated representative farms shelterbelt and no shelterbelt scenarios over the forecast period. This farm-level agroforestry modeling system provides a structure under which agroforestry practices can be evaluated from an economic, environmental and wildlife perspective. Quantitative projections provided by the system will be beneficial to landowners and policy-makers as consideration is given to the development and implementation of future agroforestry programs.

AB  - Riparian buffers have been used to reduce the loads of nonpoint source pollution to water bodies. In order to assess the effectiveness of this management practice, a decision support system was developed. This Riparian Decision Support System combines two simulation models and optimization tools. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool and the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model were integrated within a single Decision Support System providing the exchange of information between the models and an output graphic display. The models provide input data for optimization tools that are able to find the best affordable buffer location, and the least-cost width along a given water body. The Riparian Decision Support System was applied in a watershed in Delaware County, New York, to estimate the effectiveness of alternative buffer widths for the reduction of sediment and phosphorus.

AB  - Changing hydrologic regimes and increasing erosion rates threaten many tropical upland ecosystems and have been attributed to conversion from tropical forest to agricultural use. A series of experiments were conducted in headwater catchments to quantify the effect of land uses common to the steep slopes and thin, calcareous soils on surface hydrology and soil movement. To compare the surface hydrologic response of forested, tilled, swidden and pasture catchments, overland and subsurface runoff were collected separately for each land use. The forest site demonstrated the lowest runoff response and the highest rainfall threshold which initiated runoff. Conversely, the pasture sites demonstrated the greatest runoff response with the lowest rainfall thresholds which initiated runoff. The plowed and slash/mulch sites produced similar relationships between rainfall and total runoff, although the predominant flow pathway differed between these sites. Surface runoff accounted for the majority of runoff at the plowed and pasture-fallow sites, whereas interflow provided the largest contribution to runoff at the swidden and forest sites. The Alkalinity saturation ratios of interflow samples and the runoff responses were compared between sites, with the results supporting the hypothesis that disturbance of the soil surface results in progressive plugging of the epikarst by soil particles transported along macropores. The resultant throttle to percolation is evidently the greatest for fields under cultivation and may decrease after the cessation of tillage. The transect cable technique was developed as a simple and robust method for measurement of soil loss and redistribution on steep slopes. Soil erosion rates from tilled sites, both with and without farmer-adapted contour-hedgerows, a no-till swidden and two pastures were assessed by measurement of the change in soil surface height along representative transects at each site. The most effective controls on erosion were found to be reduced tillage and soil surface management. Little erosion was measured at either the untilled slash/mulch site or the overgrazed pasture fallow. For the tilled sites, establishment of vegetative cover following tillage was found to reduce water-borne erosion whereas tillage erosion was found to increase with both frequency of tillage operations and installation of contour-hedgerows.

AB  - The unsustainable land-use is the dominating obstacle of sustainable development of agriculture on Loess Plateau hilly-gully region. This paper focus on this problem, and try to find out the crucial factors of degradation and unsustainability of agri-ecosystem, even of the whole ecosystem.To use international advanced concept and methodology-Eco-regional Approach/Regional Planning, The study also introduced the series model---EPIC(Erosion and Productivity Impact Calculation) models, and combined with technology of GIS to calculate the indexes of the land-use research. The long-term experiment station and integrated control little watershed-Zhifanggou watershed was chosen as the case study area. After the validation of the model, the different scenarios from the aspects of land productivity, soil and water erosion, farming system etc could be derived and the manifold land-use methods were elicited for the stakeholders to choice.The results were as follow:(1) The model has to be validated before using for the research of Chinese area, otherwise the results of calculating would be no of sense.(2) The APEX and AV-SWAT models provide an interdisciplinary PC tool to measure the productivity of different crops, to calculate the biomass of different plants, to account the water and soil loosing from different land-use mode. As for the runoff, sediment and nutrient losing, the results are also acceptable too.(3) According to the calculation, if the buffer strips are planted on the edge of the arable slop fields, the soil and water erosion would be decreased obviously. (4) These models can be used to compare management system and their effects on nitrogen, phosphorus, pesticides and side-sediment. There should be a large numbers of data in the input and output files that can be chosen during the process of simulation.(5) The most interesting fact is that the model can be used to simulate the different influences of different land-use patterns for 50 even over 100 years from now on, so it could help stakeholders to understand the trade-off of each scenario. On the other hand, the scale of simulated watershed can change from several square kilometers to over 1000 square kilometers.(6) Due to the reasonability and veracity of the case study, with the support of acquirable database, the series EPIC models could be modified and then used in the researches of sustainable land-use on the whole Loess Plateau hilly-gully region. Research Achievements: There are 5 pieces of paper have been published (or accepted)

AB  - In this study, an integrated methodology that linked the three existing hydrologic models ADAPT, REMM, SWMM, and utilized a GIS and remotely sensed database to assess flow, sediment, nitrate on a mixed land use watershed, was developed and evaluated. The integrated linkage method was able to continuously simulate hydrological processes in the rural areas, urban areas, and riparian buffer systems respectively using ADAPT, SWMM, and REMM. In the modeling process, a large watershed was further delineated into several subwatersheds. A set of Hydrological Response Units (HRU) that reflected the impacts of land use, soil type, management practice, etc. was formed. Double triangle unit hydrograph methodology was applied for routing flow and constituents from the edge of the field to their subwatershed outlet. These two steps solved the two modeling issues regarding (1) modeling scale limitations caused by ADAPT, SWMM, and REMM models; and (2) land use spacial distributions in a watershed. The Transport block of SWMM was applied for routing hydrological responses from the subwatershed outlets to a watershed outlet along streams. A set of computer programs was developed to interface all the procedures and obtain compatible inputs and outputs. The modeling method was evaluated with measured stream flow and its constituents, including sediment and nitrate data for six years on the 1400 km2 Big Darby Creek Watershed in Ohio. Both urbanization and riparian ecosystem impacts on a watershed were assessed respectively using this method. It was found that (1) the predicted results from the linkage model had fairly consistent agreement with the observed data; (2) the stream flow, sediment and nitrogen discharges were decreased after REMM was added to simulate riparian buffer systems; (3) stream flow was increased, especially the peak flow, and sediment and nitrogen discharges were continuously decreased after SWMM was added into the model to simulate the urban lands; and (4) the agreement between the predictions and observations had significant improvement after the routing scheme was used. The model evaluations confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the linkage method and its limitations.

AB  - Due to intensive farm practices, non-point source (NPS) pollution has become one of the most challenging environmental problems in agricultural and mixed land use watersheds. The NPS pollution problem can be controlled by implementing various best management practices (BMPs) in watersheds. The objectives of this research were to: (1) evaluate comprehensive BMP scenarios in a pasture dominated watershed for controlling nutrient losses at various temporal and spatial scales; (2) evaluate the impacts of weather variation, land use changes and pasture management on improving water quality; (3) hindcast the watershed responses under a best and worst suite of BMPs implemented in the watershed; (4) optimize the selection and placement of management practices to both minimize the BMP-implemented area and pollutant loadings from the pasture lands. A total of 171 BMP combinations incorporating grazing and pasture management, riparian and buffer zones, and poultry litter applications were evaluated for their effectiveness using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was parameterized using detailed farm and watershed scale data. The stochasticity in weather was captured by generating 250 various possible weather realizations for a 25-year period, using measured historical climate data for the watershed. More than 43,000 runs of the SWAT model were needed to evaluate the impacts of 172 different watershed management decisions under stochastic weather conditions. Therefore, the SWAT model was run in the Condor environment, a distributed high performance computing framework. This framework significantly reduced the model run time from 2.5 years to 18 days and enabled us to perform comprehensive BMP analyses that may not have been possible with traditional model runs on a few desktop computers. The model results indicated that losses of total nitrogen (N), mineral phosphorus (P) and total P increased with an increase in litter application rates. For the same application rates, greatest losses were predicted for fall application timings compared to spring and summer applications. Overgrazing resulted in greater nutrient losses compared to baseline conditions for all application rates, timings, and litter characteristics indicating that overgrazing of pasture areas must be avoided if any improvement in the water quality is to be expected. Variability in weather conditions significantly affected BMP performance; under certain weather conditions, increases in pollutant losses can be greater than reductions due to BMPs implemented in the watershed. Buffer strips were the most important BMPs affecting the losses of total N and total P from the pasture areas. Considerable land use changes have been observed in the study area during 1992-2004 with an increase in urban lands from 3% to 12% of the watershed and a decrease in pasture lands from 48% to 37%. Besides land use changes, pasture management also changed during the study period. An increase in total nitrogen losses in the Beatty Branch subwatershed was mainly due to an increase in nutrient inputs in the pasture areas, and increases in total sediment and nitrogen losses in the Moores Creek subwatershed were mainly due to an increase in urban lands. Therefore, the individual impacts of land use changes and conservation practices should be quantified to get a true picture of the success of Conservation Effects Assessment Program (CEAP) in watersheds experiencing significant land use changes. An optimization model which combined a multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a watershed model (SWAT) was used to evaluate the selection and placement of BMPs among different sets of BMP options. Two objective functions were established for the optimization process, which were both minimizing pollutant loadings and the BMP placement area. Various optimal BMP combinations derived from a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) optimization tool with a different set of BMP options were further compared with the solution f om the targeting method, in which the pasture lands having greater pollutant losses were selected for BMP implementation. The results showed that the optimization is less effective when certain BMPs are not considered (e.g. vegetated filter strips), and it requires much longer computation time than the targeting method to search for optimal BMPs. Although the targeting method is effective for selecting and placing an optimal BMP, larger areas need to have BMPs implemented to achieve the same pollutant reductions as using the optimization tool.

AB  - The ecology of Formica exsectoides was assessed throughout lowbush blueberry during a four-year study. Foraging workers collected a variety of prey species with Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera being the most common groups. Foragers traveled several meters (7-18 m) in a wide range of temperatures (14-35°C) and had little impact on other predators. Laboratory studies demonstrated that colonies feed readily on blueberry flea beetle larvae and spanworm larvae, two major blueberry pests. Colonies fed continuously on flea beetle larvae as densities increased. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures were statistically similar for F. exsectoides and spiders, corroborating observations that this species is a major predator throughout blueberry. Overall, these results indicate F. exsectoides is an efficient predator throughout lowbush blueberry that has little impact on other beneficial arthropods, thus efforts to conserve colonies should be made. In order to learn more about this species, physical characteristics of mounds were evaluated. Mound temperatures as they relate to air and soil temperatures, and the role of colonies in increasing soil nutrients were examined. A six-year survey of lowbush blueberry fields was conducted to identify ant species diversity and richness. In addition, F. exsectoides abundance was evaluated during a one-year study, and laboratory investigations into the impacts of common insecticides on this species were conducted. Results indicated that fields with no chemical pesticide applications had significantly greater species richness and greater abundance of F. exsectoides . The edges and wooded areas surrounding fields had significantly greater species richness with F. exsectoides being most common on field edges. High densities of weedy vegetation were significantly correlated with increased densities of F. exsectoides , indicating a need for vegetation that supports honeydew-producing homopterans. In laboratory studies, workers were sensitive to phosmet, a highly toxic insecticide commonly sprayed throughout blueberry fields. Low toxicity insecticides such as acetamiprid and imidacloprid had little impact on worker survival in laboratory studies. Conservation of species diversity and F. exsectoides colonies may be accomplished through the reduction and judicious selection of insecticides, as well as allowing weedy vegetation growth throughout fields.

AB  - Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) such as oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfadimethoxine (SDT) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) may adversely impact human health and environmental quality. Understanding sorption and transport of VAs is important for assessing the risk of VAs reaching surface or groundwater resources. Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) affect soil properties that enhance removal of organic pollutants and thus may be a useful tool for mitigating veterinary antibiotic transport from agricultural lands. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (1) measure the sorption and retention of veterinary antibiotics to soils collected from three different soils series each planted to agroforestry buffer (AGF), grass buffer (GBS), and row crops (RC), and determine the soil physical and chemical properties governing antibiotic sorption to these soils; (2) investigate changes in VA sorption and retention to VBS and cropland soils in the presence of manure-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM); (3) and study and model VA transport through soil columns repacked with VBS and cropland soils in presence and absence of manure-derived DOM. Sorption experiment results show that OTC was strongly adsorbed by all soils and was not readily extractable, whereas SDT and SMZ sorption to soils were weak and therefore highly mobile in soils. The sorption isotherms for OTC and SMZ were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. Further investigation of solid-to-solution partition coefficients ( Kd ) revealed that vegetative management had a significant (P < 0.01) influence on SMZ sorption and followed the order AGF > GBS > RC, and for OTC sorption VBS > RC. Significant differences in Kd values for these VAs were also noted among the soil series studied. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. For SMZ, organic carbon content, pH, initial SMZ concentration, and clay content were the most important factors controlling sorption. Study of the two most contrasting soils revealed that increasing solution pH from 6.0 to 7.5 greatly reduced SMZ sorption to the Armstrong GBS soil, but little pH effect was observed for the Huntington GBS soil. Although the presence of DOM (150 mg L -1 C) had little effect on Freundlich model parameters, DOM resulted in slightly lower SMZ Kd values, presumably, due to competitive interactions between the VA and DOM for sorption sites. Transport study including 14 C-labeled SMZ or SMZ plus DOM (150 mg L-1 OC) and non-reactive tracer bromide was conducted in saturated columns packed with Huntington soil (silt loam) planted to AGF and RC. Bromide breakthrough curves were fitted with an equilibrium model within the CXTFIT software, whereas SMZ breakthrough was fitted with the HYDRUS-1D software using two-site and three-site models with linear or Freundlich sorption components. Results indicate that the three-site model containing two reversible sites and one irreversible site coupled with the Freundlich sorption component (3S2R-Freu-irrev model) best describes SMZ transport through the columns with model efficiencies of 0.998, 0.994, and 0.991 for AGF, AGF + DOM and cropland soils, respectively. Fitted sorption parameters such as Kd , Kf and N are in the same range of those obtained from equilibrium sorption experiments. DOM effects were not observed due to diluted DOM concentration. Data from equilibrium sorption experiments and column transport experiments suggest that the AGF soil has a larger capacity to retain SMZ than the cropland soil. Overall, this research facilitates our understanding of VA sorption and transport in the environment and supports the use of vegetative buffers to mitigate VA loss from agroecosystems.

AB  - Data are presented from experimental work carried out under two inter-related projects. The first project concerned the role of an outer unsprayed six-metres of cereal crop (`Conservation Headland') in reducing the effects of pesticide drift into field boundaries, potentially ameliorating the harmful environmental effects on beneficial arthropods. The findings showed that such strips substantially reduced drift, giving `added value' to a farm management technique already shown, because of the improved habitat it represented, to benefit populations of gamebirds, butterflies and predatory arthropods. The second part of this drift-related work was to evaluate the toxicity of the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin at `drift' levels to Lepidoptera larvae (Pieris brassicae and P.rapae) in the laboratory. A model predicting mortality at given levels of drift indicated high levels of short-term risk to larvae exposed to rates of drift deposition recorded in the field. The potential of buffer zones to reduce the toxicological impact of spray drift in the field is discussed. The second half of the overall programme was a project set up by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to investigate the long-term effects of pesticide use on non-target invertebrates in arable crops. This involved monitoring the arthropod populations from three farms, in each of which fields were split into `Reduced Input Approach' (RIA) and `Current Farm Practice' (CFP) treatments. The main sampling method used was pitfall trapping. There was one `baseline' year of data collection before the treatments were established. Data from the first three treatment years of this long-term project indicated that most damage to populations of beneficial arthropods was done by autumn- and winter-applied broad-spectrum insecticides. Supporting ecological and toxicological studies were carried out to help interpret the results from the field monitoring, in particular in terms of the experimental design of the project.

AB  - To alleviate negative effects of forest harvesting on wildlife in boreal forests, forest managers are attempting to emulate patterns of wildfire disturbance in treed riparian buffers using partial-harvesting techniques. I assessed the response of cavity-nesting birds to forest harvesting in riparian buffers, and identified habitat features relevant to bird management across three spatial scales in the Boreal Plains ecozone of SK and MB in 2005 and 2006. The composition of bird assemblages shifted when less than 33% of forest was retained in buffers. Site-use by Brown Creepers ( Certhia americana ), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis ), Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus varius ) and Boreal Chickadees ( Poecile hudsonica ) decreased with increasing amount of harvest. Compared to harvested buffers, burned riparian forest supported more Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus ), Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor ) and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon ). Site-use by most species was related to habitat at a scale similar to their territory size.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) kill pests and can diminish outbreaks. Species of EPF such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum (formerly M. anisopliae ) are significant mortality factors for several insects. Better understanding of these organisms is an essential step in developing strategies to conserve EPF in agricultural systems. We hypothesize that 1) organically farmed soil is more suitable to EPF than conventional soil, and 2) conventionally-farmed soil, coupled with the use of synthetic chemical inputs, could have negative impacts on EPF. In 2011 and 2012, soil was collected from organic and conventional fields of corn and soybean and the field margins. Entomopathogenic fungi from the soil samples were quantified by measuring mortality of larval greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and by counting colony-forming units on selective growth media. Field history and soil properties were analyzed with multiple regression analysis to determine factors that may affect the abundance of fungal EPF. In 2011, the EPF B. bassiana and EPF in the genus Metarhizium were lowest in conventional fields, and the average number of colony-forming units for Metarhizium spp. was also lowest in conventional fields. Multiple regression analysis revealed that abundance of Metarhizium was positively associated with applications of organic fertilizer and silt content, and negatively associated with nitrogen content, tillage, conventional field margins, conventional fields and herbicide applications. A laboratory study was conducted in which herbicides and fungicides were applied to soil containing different strains of Metarhizium, and the abundance of fungi was measured after the addition of pesticide by quantifying colony-forming units on selective media and larval mortality of G. mellonella . None of the pesticides had significantly negative impacts on the abundance and virulence of Metarhizium spp . These results suggest that soil properties and particular farming practices, can affect populations of soil-borne EPF.

AB  - This study investigated the results of biological assessments using fish and macroinvertebrates when applied to first order streams of north-central Mississippi that had been exposed to two different logging treatments. A physicochemical assessment also was conducted to determine the effects of riparian buffer zones on in-stream habitat and riparian conditions. Univariate analysis of physicochemical variables indicated no differences between logging treatments, although principal component analysis indicated physicochemical differences regarding substrate and temperature. Assessment of the fish and macroinvertebrate communities were unable to show differences between logging treatments. Macroinvertebrate communities were dominated by tolerant organisms utilizing fine particulate organic matter indicating a disruption of organic matter dynamics within these small stream ecosystems when compared to stream ecosystem theory expectations.

AB  - With the implementation of recent forestry initiatives, it is becoming increasingly important to assess the effects of these policies on wildlife. In this study, I evaluated the effects of riparian buffer zones on breeding birds within a fragmented, managed, landscape in east Texas during spring and summer of 1996 and 1997. I compared bird abundance and richness, arthropod biomass and abundance, nest predation frequency, and predator abundance between upland, pine plantations and bottomland-hardwood, riparian buffer zones. Within each stand, transects were established parallel to the stand edge to allow comparisons between stand interior, edge, and outside of the stand. Bird richness and abundance and arthropod biomass and abundance were significantly [Special characters omitted.] higher in bottomland interior transects. Predation frequencies on artificial nests also were significantly [Special characters omitted.] higher in bottomland interiors. Raccoons (Procyon lotor ) and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos ) were the most common egg predators. Predators also were significantly [Special characters omitted.] more abundant in the bottomland interiors than at other sites. Riparian buffer zones, commonly used by forest products companies to create wildlife habitat and preserve water quality, appear to support larger numbers and a greater diversity of birds, arthropods, and predators than upland stands. However, I also found higher nest predation frequencies in the riparian zones, suggesting these areas may serve as ecological traps for breeding birds.

AB  - Data are presented from research conducted to investigate the role of beetle banks in the biological control of cereal aphids.A project designed to compare overwintering predator densities in a newly established beetle bank and two conventional hedgebanks over a five year period, indicated that predator densities were similar to or greater than those in the surrounding hedgebanks by the second year of the beetle banks establishment. Predators found overwintering on the beetle bank included many species that are considered to be important predators of cereal aphids. A further overwintering experiment conducted over a four year period, investigated five different grass species sown on beetle banks and a natural regeneration treatment, for their suitability in providing overwintering cover for polyphagous predators. Overall, the highest overwintering predator densities were recorded in grass species with tussocky growth forms and the lowest predator densities were recorded in treatments where the vegetation on the beetle bank had been allowed to naturally regenerate.During the spring and summer, a predator exclusion experiment was conducted to explore the effect of polyphagous predators emigrating from a beetle bank on cereal aphid populations in an adjacent crop of winter wheat. The results from this experiment indicated that polyphagous predators significantly reduced aphid populations in the crop, though the impact of polyphagous predation appeared to decrease with increasing distance away from the beetle bank. The results from the exclusion experiment, together with the results from a further experiment investigating the effect of the presence or absence of a beetle bank on the distribution of polyphagous predators in crops, also indicated that beetle banks aid the rapid conclusion of cereal fields by polyphagous predators in the early spring, when the potential for aphid control is optimal.Cost-benefit analysis suggested that an aphid population kept below spray threshold levels by enhanced natural enemy populations emigrating from a beetle bank, could result in a small but potentially useful saving in insecticide costs.

Further research needs are also identified.

AB  - Effective environmental management requires an accurate inventory of the resources to be managed. Decision makers often lack the technical expertise necessary to understand the limitations of environmental data. The State of North Carolina is re-surveying elevations using Light Detection and Ranging to re-delineate floodplains. These data allow analysts to predict flood inundation extents of design storms in order to better manage flood-prone terrain. Conversely, many environmental management functions in North Carolina, such as calculating stream length for hydrologic modeling and riparian buffer protection, rely upon outdated paper maps such as the USGS topographic map series for the determination of the location of stream ''blue lines''. These cartographic products are inadequate for use in headwater stream mapping when compared to field observations yet no better data source has been found to achieve the accuracy needed for local site planning. This research evaluated the horizontal accuracy and completeness of currently available stream maps compared to stream networks derived from DEMs obtained from the USGS, the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program, and interpolated from LiDAR bare-earth elevation points. A unique system combining software and hardware was developed to map headwater catchments with global positioning systems and was used to perform field data collection at nine catchments distributed across four physiographic regions. A method of determining the horizontal accuracy of stream lines shown on maps was developed and used to show that stream networks delineated using high-resolution, interpolated DEMs are more accurately positioned than those on previously published maps or stream networks delineated from currently available DEMs.

AB  - Management of agroecosystems to enhance natural pest regulation requires an understanding of predator ecology and how predatory insects use the landscape and respond to its structural characteristics. A group of predatory insects, ladybird beetles, were selected to study patterns of habitat utilization in response to vegetation type, management practices, and habitat succession. This work was conducted at the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS. First, a life systems study of Coleomegilla maculata lengi was conducted to determine beetle aggregation sites in the landscape, and to determine paths of energy flow in a beetle-crop system by using stable isotopes. Secondly, abundance patterns of fourteen species of coccinellids were monitored during the growing season using yellow-sticky traps. The sampled landscape consisted of an array of field crops under different management practices, interspersed with poplar and early successional vegetation. Seven years of information were analyzed using Shannon-Wiener and richness indices, Kendall's coefficient of concordance, and principal component analysis. The results of the analysis were used to produce a spatially explicit population model. The main finding of the study were: (a) Ladybird beetle species diversity peaked during the second year of secondary succession with a successive decrease in diversity thereafter. In poplar, there was a "succession" of dominance by three beetle species; (b) Reduced chemical inputs (herbicides and fertilizers) decreased beetle abundance and species diversity in corn fields but these components increased in wheat. In the corn-soybean rotation sequence, C. m. lengi, was most abundant when corn vegetation was present; and (c) Adults of C. m. lengi used woodlots, hedgerows, and rows of trees to aggregate prior to the onset of winter. Large aggregations occurred near agricultural fields where corn or alfalfa was grown the previous summer. Within the framework of the KBS LTER theme that ecological knowledge can replace chemical subsidies, this work contributes to the role that management practices can have on beneficial insects and identifies landscape characteristics conducive to maintaining higher numbers of beneficial insect predators within agroecosystems.

AB  - This dissertation examines the sustainability of the use of oxen by the Maasai and Arusha (WaArusha) people, in Monduli District, Tanzania. Traditionally pastoralists, the Maasai are undergoing a social and agricultural transformation process of sedentarization in this region. The villages included in the case study were Arkatan, Engaruka, Esilalei, Lashaine, Lendikenya, Lolkisale, Losirwa, Mbuyuni, Mswakini, and Selela. Using semi-structured interviews the heads of 130 Maasai homesteads ( bomas ), as well as, other informants were interviewed. The history, issues of technology transfer and future prospects of animal traction were examined, as well as, the obstacles and constraints facing the Maasai in their adoption of this technology. This case study also documents and compares the agricultural development and cropping strategies of the Maasai and WaArusha people related to the adoption and sustainable use of animal traction. The adoption of oxen and other forms of agricultural power, including tractors, by the Maasai has transformed their view of land tenure, their access to common grazing areas, and their ability to share grazing resources with wildlife. Adopting well-known agricultural development strategies, the Maasai have also tried to maintain their livestock keeping and pastoral culture. Monduli District, located in Northern Tanzania, is adjacent to many wildlife areas and National Parks, including Lake Manyara National Park, Tarangire National Park, Arusha National Park, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Nearby Maasai grazing areas have been considered important wildlife corridors. The proximity to these wildlife areas has created a situation where large numbers of wildlife frequently pass through and raid crop fields. The Maasai and WaArusha people face a shrinking land base, reducing their ability to survive by pastoralism alone. Crop growing has become an important part of their economic survival. The landscape in the research area has changed dramatically in the last 15 years. This land use change, particularly in highland areas, has created environmental problems, such as overgrazing, soil erosion, as well as, decreased vegetative cover leading to lower soil moisture levels. The result has been decreased crop yields in many areas, with increased social and wildlife conflicts, as well as, rampant environmental problems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to document the bird communities of six 'scarce forest habitats' in an upland spruce forest (Kielder, in Northumberland) and to compare them to the bird communities that were associated with its conifer plantations. Features of the scarce forest habitats considered to be important to their bird communities were investigated. The implications of these findings for future forest management are discussed, particularly in relation to the contributions these habitats make to the overall diversity of forest avifauna.Up to 76 study plots were selected randomly from six scarce forest habitat types; broad-leaved woodland, mixed broad-leafed/conifer woodland, windthrown conifer stands, streams with unplanted riparian strips, unplanted land and streams with broad-leaved riparian strips. Five-minute point counts, with up to 60 m radius, were used to estimate the relative abundance of species. Counts were carried out between 1992 and 1994, in winter (November to December), early spring (April to mid May) and late spring (mid May to mid June). Each study plot was visited once in each of these seasons, under similar weather conditions.There were few widespread species amongst the different habitats, only the chaffinch Fringilla coelebs was recorded consistently in more than 50% of spring plots. The commonest species in the scarce forest habitats were the same as those found in the adjacent conifer plantations. The majority of the species recorded occurred in a small proportion of plots such that variation in their numbers could not be analysed statistically. However, these less abundant species were classified arbitrarily into two groups, 'uncommon' species (occurring in only 3-10 plots in any one season) and 'occasional' species (occurring in only 1-2 plots in any one season). Unplanted riparian strips held greater numbers of these species during the spring than did the other scarce forest habitats.

AB  - The landscape of Iowa is dominated by monoculture production of corn (Zea mays ) and soybean (Glycine max ). In order to diversify the landscape and increase ecosystem services while maintaining a productive landscape, this thesis considered two strategies for incorporating and using reconstructed prairie in Iowa agriculture. The first strategy considered was the use of reconstructed prairie buffer strips in soybean fields to attract aphidophagous predators to increase diversity and assist in the control of soybean aphid ( Aphis glycines ). While prairie buffer strips were effective at increasing aphidophagous predator abundance, this did not translate into an increase in biological control of soybean aphids. The second strategy considered the use of reconstructed prairie as a source of forage for grazing operations, to balance production and conservation needs. This topic was studied as a case study at Whiterock Conservancy in Coon Rapids, Iowa. The reconstructed prairies studied provided some but not all of the nutritional requirements of cattle during the grazing season. An economic analysis found that grazing reconstructed prairies was more profitable than purchasing low-quality hay. The majority of grazing systems in Iowa are focused on non-native cool season grasses, however a handful of graziers and land managers include native-plant-based grazing systems in their operation. Based on interviews of graziers and land managers, we found there are multiple economically and ecologically viable options for incorporating native plants into grazing systems.

AB  - The widespread loss of apex predators from the western U.S. is having cascading effects on ecosystems. As in other western parks, riparian willow (Salix spp.) communities in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) are declining as a result of a trophic cascade involving the local extinction of wolves (Canis lupus ) and an exponential increase in elk (Cervus elaphus ). In 2008, RMNP began installing elk exclosures to protect and restore willow communities and the diverse taxa that depend on riparian ecosystems from heavy browsing. Using point counts, I evaluated the effect of elk exclosures and riparian shrub condition on songbird density and occupancy. I found little support for a direct effect of elk exclosures on bird communities, with the exception of shrub nesting birds which occurred at higher densities within exclosures. However, the density and occupancy of some riparian bird species and guilds was positively correlated with particular vegetation conditions in this ecosystem. Shrub height positively related to both density and occupancy of Dusky Flycatcher. For the Lincoln Sparrow and shrub-nesting guild, occupancy also had a positive relationship with shrub height. The percent of shrub cover within 15 m of the survey point was an important positive predictor of density for Lincoln's Sparrows, Song Sparrows, and Wilson's Warblers, and foliage-gleaner and shrub-nesting guilds. The percent of riparian shrub cover within 300 m was an important positive predictor for the density of Wilson's Warblers. American Robin, a habitat generalist, and ground-nesting and foraging guilds did not respond strongly to shrub cover or height at any scale. These results reflect the variable shrub conditions inside and outside exclosures, and affirm that managing for mid to high density shrub cover and height will be beneficial for some riparian specialists. My findings provide park managers critical information on bird communities in experimental elk exclosures, and insight into the conditions needed to support songbird communities in the park's riparian ecosystems.

AB  - Recoveries from the final inspection belts of Minnesota pea processing plants showed the most important invertebrate contaminants of processing peas to be pupae of Colias spp., 5th instar larvae of cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), 5th instar larvae of Orthosia hibisci (Guenee), 5th instar larvae of celery looper, Anagrapha falcifera (Kirby), adults of the onespotted stink bug, Euschistus variolarius (Palisot de Beauvois), and adult ground beetles dominated by Pterostichus spp. Contaminant problems differed between processing plants. Species found in production pea fields were only weakly correlated in frequency with species found at inspection belts. Current harvest and procession operations removed the greatest percentage of contaminants with the percentage cleanup determined by the contaminant and the processing plant. For sampling fields, use of a tray in foliage shake surveys was found to be the most efficient method. Sweep net sampling was limited to capturing Colias spp. larvae. Lepidopterous larvae were most abundant along field edges. The most effective biological control agents in pea fields were Apanteles flaviconchae Muesebeck, a parasitoid of Colias spp., and Euplectrus comtockii Howard, a parasitoid of various noctuid larvae. Copidosoma truncatellum (Dalman) increased contaminant incidence by appearing as a contaminant on inspection belts, mixed with the host prepupa, and by prolonging the 5th instar of various plusiine larvae. Developmental requirements for certain pest organisms were determined to be: celery looper, larvae 254 degree days (DD) with a 6(DEGREES)C base temperature (BT); celery looper pupae 105 DD, 9.5(DEGREES)C BT; cabbage looper larvae 212 DD, 9.5(DEGREES)C; cabbage looper pupae 81 DD, 11.5(DEGREES)C BT; alfalfa caterpillar, Colias eurytheme Boisduval larvae 175 DD, 12.75(DEGREES)C BT; alfalfa caterpillar pupae 83 DD, 12.5(DEGREES)C BT. The developmental rates of these organisms should be utilized in timing of insecticide applications and in determining target organisms during field surveys. The cultivars Green Giant 359 and Little Marvel were resistant to cabbage looper causing high mortality, retarded development, and the production of supernumerary instars. Green Giant 359 was resistant to celery looper, producing similar growth disorders.

AB  - The current biodiversity crisis has received a great deal of attention over the past two decades. As of 2006, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) found that of 40,177 species assessed using IUCN Red List criteria, 16,199 are now listed as threatened with extinction. They found that one out of every eight bird species, one out of every four mammal species, and one out of every three species of amphibians was at risk of extinction. While a number of factors have been attributed to the decline of amphibians (e.g., chemical pollution, disease, global climate change, introduction of exotic species), habitat loss and degradation are generally accepted as the main cause of this decline. Amphibians are especially sensitive to loss and degradation of habitat due to their unique life history requirements (i.e. most amphibians require both aquatic and terrestrial resources to complete their life cycle). While there are many types of habitat loss and degradation (e.g., agriculture, land development), many studies have focused on the impacts of logging on wildlife populations and on ecosystem processes. For amphibians, much of the work has focused on pond-breeding amphibians or amphibians that do not require water for reproduction. Little information, however, exists on the effects of logging on amphibians that require streams for reproduction. In order to mitigate the impacts of habitat alteration on stream amphibians, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the role abiotic and biotic factors play in determining habitat use and abundance. Additionally, we must determine the effects of forest management practices, such as timber harvesting, have on amphibian populations in order to develop alternative management strategies. I have used direct (e.g., area-constrained daytime searches, visual encounter nighttime searches) and indirect (laboratory studies) methods to estimate the habitat use of stream salamanders. Specifically, I have determined the core terrestrial habitat use and the abiotic and biotic factors associated with microhabitat use and abundance, as well as determining how stream salamanders respond to predators in altered environments. Further, I have demonstrated the effects even-aged timber harvesting has on stream salamander populations and how current United States Forest Service regulations on riparian buffer widths function to protect these populations. My data show that core terrestrial habitat use, microhabitat use, and overall stream salamander abundance are dependent on leaf litter depth and soil moisture. Furthermore, as leaf litter depth and soil moisture are reduced as a result of even-aged timber harvesting, the core terrestrial habitat use and abundance of salamanders decrease as a result of fewer microhabitats being available. The decrease in suitable microhabitats available is accompanied by a resulting increase in competition between stream salamander species. Lastly, I found that current USFS regulations for riparian buffer widths are vastly inadequate to protect stream salamander populations from activities such as timber harvesting.

AB  - The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Matsumura), is an Asian soybean pest that has rapidly invaded the United States. Because A. glycines is a recent pest in the United States, a comprehensive, integrated management approach to control this aphid has yet to be developed. In an overwintering study conducted in 2005 and 2006, overwintered egg survivorship was nearly 100% in both years. Additionally, successful reproduction on the overwintering host plant, buckthorn (Rhamnus ), and migration of A. glycines from Rhamnus in woodlots and shelterbelts to soybean was documented in the spring of both years. The date of first eclosion of soybean aphid in the overwintering study was 10 April in 2005 and 12 April in 2006. The migration of alate females from Rhamnus to soybean beginning on 15 and 17 May, 2005 and 2006, respectively, coincided with leaf development on soybean plants ranging from cotyledon to second trifoliate development stages in nearby soybean production fields. A second set of experiments was conducted using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique to ascertain the effects of 'Dowling' on A. glycines ' feeding behavior. The electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings showed that soybean aphids had difficulty penetrating the sieve tube elements, resulting in the inability of soybean aphid to feed successfully on phloem. The final component of this dissertation examined the tritrophic effects of 'Dowling' on the parasitoid wasp Aphidius colemani when it fed on the soybean aphid. In a series of choice tests, A. colemani parasitized soybean aphid feeding on 'Dowling' and a susceptible check ('Glenwood') equally, suggesting no effect of resistance on parasitoid oviposition preference. Results from no-choice tests indicated that development time and survival of A. colemani that developed in aphids that fed on 'Dowling' did not differ from those individuals that developed in aphids on 'Glenwood'. However, weights of adult male A. colemani developing in aphids feeding on 'Dowling' were reduced compared to the weights of adult males that developed in aphids which fed on 'Glenwood'. Additionally, the sex ratio of wasps reared in 'Dowling'-fed aphids was strongly biased towards males compared to wasps reared in 'Glenwood'-fed aphids.

AB  - Aspects of the ecology of the Stonechat were investigated. Regional differences in breeding performance were detected. Northern Britain had larger clutch and brood sizes and a lower probability of daily nest failure. Differences in reproductive performance between habitat categories were associated with regional differences i.e. the majority of cards assigned to 'coastal' habitats originated in the north of Britain. Both clutch and brood sizes exhibited a mid-season peak which is characteristic of a multi-brooded species. The distribution and habitat associations of the Stonechat in southwest Ireland were investigated to explain its decline in the region, which was highlighted in recent atlas studies. A total of fifty-six 1km2 sites were surveyed in winter and summer between 1997 and 1999. The highest densities of Stonechats were recorded in coastal sites in winter, as expected. Sites that were primarily improved grasslands held the lowest densities of Stonechats in winter and summer. The effect of increased habitat diversity on Stonechat densities was positive. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) identified a major gradient of change in habitats from farmland areas with trees and hedgerows to more open habitats of heather moorland and bogs. In winter, Stonechat distribution was positively influenced by areas of built land i.e. roads and buildings and negatively associated with hedgerows, treelines and areas of inland rock. The presence of scrub and coastal habitats at sites further explained Stonechat presence in winter while sites further from the coast or those located in more upland regions were avoided. The presence of Stonechats in summer was positively related to sites that contained areas of heathland and bog, which were situated in more upland areas and negatively associated with farmland habitats.

AB  - As climate change shifts and intensifies fire regimes, it is important to understand stream ecosystem responses to fire. How stream metabolism responds remains largely unexplored. We investigated effects of fire severity and watershed geomorphology on stream ecosystem metabolism at multiple spatial scales in an Idaho wilderness watershed. We measured dissolved oxygen, temperature, and irradiance in 18 streams varying in fire history and watershed characteristics in order to model diel oxygen dynamics, from which we estimated rates of production (P) and respiration (R), then used P:R as an index of stream metabolic state. We found that post-fire riparian canopy recovery strongly influenced stream metabolic state. Severely burned streams with dense riparian regrowth were heterotrophic, whereas streams with less canopy recovery were autotrophic. Fire effects on stream metabolic state were highly mediated by watershed geomorphology, with the strongest long-term changes observed in low-order, narrow, steep streams. Effect sizes of fire and watershed geomorphology on stream metabolism changed from fine spatial scale (500-m riparian buffer) to coarse scale (watershed), and were strongest at fine scales. These results indicate that the physical habitat template mediates aquatic ecosystem response to disturbance, and that context and scale should be explicitly considered in assessments of ecosystem response to fire.

AB  - During the last decades, structural, floristic and faunistic diversity of the agricultural landscapes in Northern and Western Europe has declined considerably owing to the intensification of agriculture from the 1950's on. In reaction to biodiversity loss, EU policy pursuited the ecologisation and multifunctionality of agriculture. Field margins do pioneering work in the ecologisation of agriculture since they are the interface between intensive farming practices and the wider environment. The presented multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, unfertilised, sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. Margin strips were mown twice a year with a late first cut on 15 June and a regrowth cut on 15 September to meet nature conservation purposes. From conservational concern , species diversity on the long term seemed unaffected by the type of plant community that was installed. The decrease in species diversity was more pronounced under a mowing regime without removal of cuttings. The annual addition of mown roadside herbage significantly enhanced species richness. Convergence in vegetation composition between sown and unsown plots occurred in terms of species importance. From agricultural concern , the importance of economically important weeds Elymus repens Gould, Cirsium arvense L. and Urtica dioica Scop. was significantly higher when cuttings were not removed and in the unsown community. Seed dispersal into the adjacent crop was only of importance one year after installation of the margin strips; seedrain was significantly 8 times higher nearby the unsown community than nearby sown communities. The feeding value of herbage from field margin strips was low compared to the feeding value of herbage harvested in agricultural managed fertilized grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock. From environmental concern , the reduction of soil mineral N nearby the boundary by the presence of a margin strip was responsable for the increase in abundance of less competitive species and enrichment of species diversity within the semi-natural boundary.

However, many of the same processes in the subsurface that help to reduce this nutrient loading, may also be leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emissions from these areas. Agricultural riparian zones in Southern Ontario are often characterized by a sloped topography, with the highest topographic position being closest to the field edge, decreasing towards an adjacent stream or other surface water body. This topographic variability, combined with lateral chemical inputs from both upland areas and the stream, is expected to cause variable hydrochemical environments throughout the RZ, which may therefore lead to variable N 2 O dynamics between upland, mid-riparian and lowland areas. The objectives of this study were to examine these spatial trends in N2 O production and resulting emissions, as related to the hydrochemical environment in these three distinct zones. Objectives were achieved by instrumenting 6 sites across two transects running perpendicular from the agricultural field edge, towards the stream edge, analyzing for subsurface N 2 O, moisture and temperature, groundwater NO 3 , NH4 , dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen, and surface fluxes of N2 O. Subsurface N2 O concentrations and ground water nutrient concentrations displayed distinct spatial and temporal/seasonal trends in the three positions across the RZ, however N2 O fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface did not display strong or consistent spatial trends. There was a disconnect between the subsurface variables and the fluxes at the surface, in that N2 O emissions did not reflect the N2 O concentrations produced in the shallow soil profile (150 cm deep), nor were they significantly related to the geochemical environment at each position. The lack of visible spatial trends in N2 O fluxes may have been due to an "oxic blanket" effect which may divide the surface from the subsurface soil profile. As N2 O fluxes in this study (-0.28 to 1.3 nmol m -2 s-1 ) were within the range observed at other, similar study sites, the oxic blanket doesn't appear to impede concentrations of N2 O reaching the soil-atmosphere interface. This may suggest that the N2 O released as a flux was being produced in the very shallow soil profile (0-5 cm), above the soil gas profile arrays installed at this site. Subsurface concentrations of N2 O were fairly high at certain depths and times, which was not reflected in the fluxes. This may have resulted from nitrifier denitrification reducing N2 O to N 2 before it reached the surface, in aerobic zones above the water table. Another potential reason for the lack of connection between subsurface processes and surface emissions was the high heterogeneity observed across the RZ, which may have overshadowed potential differences between positions. Physical soil properties like porosity and bulk density across the RZ also potentially impacted the N 2 O movement through the soil profile, resulting in similar fluxes among positions, and over time. The missing connection between subsurface N2 O concentrations, ground water nutrients, and the surface fluxes was not a hypothesized result, and requires further research and analysis for a better understanding of the production and consequent movement of N 2 O.

AB  - Damages due to the activities of the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides) are estimated to cost Manitoba forage producers over $15 million annually, with similar losses estimated in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Losses across North America likely total several hundred million dollars annually. Pocket gophers consume forage plants below and above ground, and excavate subterranean tunnel systems, bringing excess soil to the surface, producing mounds. These mounds suffocate crops, damage machinery and cause immeasurable frustration for prairie forage producers. Objectives of this study were to (1)~determine loss in alfalfa yield due to pocket gopher consumption and damage, and whether this loss is economically significant; (2)~analyse the effectiveness of grass, cultivated and treated buffer zones of varying widths on the control of pocket gopher invasion; and (3)~provide a method to determine the most cost-effective option(s) to farmers to control pocket gopher damage. Decreases in harvestable yield on plots occupied by pocket gophers were significant, with average losses of 22.9\%. Effectiveness of buffer zones varied between treatments; however, their use as configured in this study cannot be recommended at this time. A management strategy is outlined, incorporating the average yield loss of 22.9% and the cumulative costs of three control options; leaving the stand untreated, applying a rodenticide and re-establishing the stand every three years, over a period of 5 harvest years. When compared to the costs of no treatment, applying a rodenticide proved to be an economically viable option on the study site, whereas the costs of re-establishing the stand every three years was economically inefficient.

AB  - The main objective of this thesis was to analyse the role of denitrification in groundwater NO3- retention in riparian zones at various scales, i.e. from the (hot) spot to the catchment. In conclusion, the following new aspects can be deducted: (1) The identification of geomorphology (e.g. 'buried' organic carbon) as a first important controlling variable for groundwater NO3 - retention in riparian zones; (2) The identification of hydrology as a second important controlling variable for groundwater NO 3- retention in riparian zones; (3) The introduction of a unique methodology, i.e. the use of the natural abundance of 15 N in groundwater NO3- to quantify the relative importance of denitrification and plant uptake for groundwater NO3- retention in riparian zones; (4) The development of an ecosystem indicator to identify potential riparian zones for groundwater NO3- retention. Such an indicator could be the 'holy grail' for applied riparian buffer zone research (policy relevant). Thus, groundwater NO3- retention in riparian zones is largely controlled by the hydrogeomorphology (see 1 and 2) of the river valley, rather than by its vegetation cover. Consequently, the proposed methods (see 3 and 4) to identify the occurrence of ideal hydrogeomorphological settings may contribute to management strategies and the identification of potential areas for the (re-)construction of riparian zones for water pollution control.

AB  - Agricultural land use is the dominant cause of impairment of rivers and streams in the United States, primarily through its contribution to non-point source pollution. Stream restoration through watershed and riparian land management has the potential to reverse much of this degradation. In this thesis, I explored the hypothesis that the degree to which land management can contribute to restoration goals varies over the landscape. This variability was formalized into models of restoration potential to support efforts by the State of Wisconsin to prioritize and allocate management activities. Statistical simulations on a model agricultural landscape were used to compare four alternative approaches for the spatial allocation of management activities. Targeting activities at two nested spatial scales (field and watershed) achieves phosphorus reductions most efficiently, particularly when phosphorus is measured at the watershed outlet. This method also facilitates experimentation and adaptive management. Based on regression models, sediment and phosphorus loads in Wisconsin streams are driven by riparian land cover and physiographic patterns. The potential for pollutant load reduction following watershed-scale implementation of riparian buffers was modeled as the estimated current load minus the fraction that buffers are not capable of attenuating. In most watersheds, ∼70% of current loads could be retained by buffers. Spatial autoregressive models were used to predict the response of six stream fish species to watershed restoration. GIS-derived environmental characteristics at both local and regional scales were significant predictors of species' occurrence. After accounting for the proximity of potential restoration sites to existing suitable habitat, the extent of streams predicted restorable for each species was small (0.4-8% of all streams). The nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ15 N) of biological tissue has potential to serve as an indicator of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to aquatic ecosystems. A survey of Wisconsin streams in agricultural settings indicated that denitrification of inorganic fertilizer has a greater influence than manure on nitrogen stable isotope ratios. As a whole, this thesis supports the hypothesis that streams and watersheds vary in their potential to respond to restoration activities, and provides methods for targeting those activities where they are most likely to produce measurable benefits.

AB  - Conversion of natural grasslands for agricultural uses and intensification of agricultural production has been a major cause of natural ecosystem fragmentation and biodiversity loss. Diversifying agricultural landscapes by adding semi-natural grasslands can potentially help couple agricultural production (i.e., providing food, fiber, and energy to a growing human population) with environmental stewardship, enhancing ecosystem health, and increasing biodiversity. To ensure long-term ecological benefits of buffers and to maintain them as suitable habitat for prairie-associated species, periodic disturbance is required to keep buffers in an early-successional grassland plant community. In this dissertation, I fill knowledge gaps about biodiversity of semi-natural grassland buffers within agroecosystems. I investigate influence of prairie-history on buffer forb communities and effects of disking and burning on semi-natural grassland buffer plant and butterfly communities. I also investigate suitability of using butterflies as surrogates of birds and plants on semi-natural grassland buffers. Prairie-history influenced buffer forb communities, and disking increased forb richness and abundance. Disturbance guild butterflies responded positively to disking, most likely due to increased availability of nectar-rich plants. Grassland guild butterflies were not impacted negatively by disking or burning. Responses of plants and butterflies to disking and burning varied between sampling years. Effects of disking in fall 2007 persisted for two growing seasons, but I observed little effects of disking in fall 2008. Butterflies, with the possible exception of Pearl Crescent, were unsuitable as surrogates for birds. In contrast, butterflies, including Pearl Crescent, showed suitable or marginally suitable correlations with plants. Results of my study should help agricultural producers accomplish environmental conservation objectives and provide science-based information for developing and refining USDA practice standards and policy. Key words: burning, butterflies, disking, field buffers, forbs, grassland, surrogate

AB  - This study examines the woodland management traditions practised in Nidderdale and Wensleydale since the 15th century to evaluate the role of woodland management as an influential factor in determining the survival of woodland in the landscape. It has found that in these two Dales, woodland management practices were a function of the district land-use frameworks created by monastic (Nidderdale) or seigneurial (Wensleydale) tenure. In Nidderdale coppice woodland predominated over wood pasture to meet the requirements of the mineral-smelting activities of Fountains Abbey, whereas in Wensleydale a different form of land-use consisting of deer parks and stinted grazing pastures featured more wood pasture than coppice. Within these frameworks the function of woodland was either as a source of raw materials, or as an environment for hunting. Woodland was as resource to which the landless rural population had little access and few rights. In consequence, domestic fuel and small wood was sourced from commonland and the hedgerows that characterised parts of Nidderdale and mid-Wensleydale prior to the Parliamentary Enclosures. During the time period covered by this research, there was, in Nidderdale, a gradual transition from the intensive coppice regimes of Fountains Abbey, to the amenity and plantation forestry enterprises of the Ingilby Estate. By contrast, in Wensleydale, the remodelling of parkland-derived wood pasture into plantation forestry on the Bolton Estate occurred within the space of a few years during the late 18th century. The characteristics of woodland are related to past management, and management is a function of the outputs, or end-uses of woodland. Thus the extensive semi-natural woods that characterised a large extent of Nidderdale, prior to their conversion to coniferous plantations, were the product of a coppice management regime whose purpose was to produce charcoal or kiln-dried wood, whereas many woods in Wensleydale were primarily planted for timber production.

AB  - Farmers are increasingly conflicted between maintaining the integrity of the land and trying to succeed in a competitive market place. Agroforestry may offer opportunities, but awareness of the various practices is very limited, and little is known of what motivates their interest. Five practices are modeled using Logit regressions pooling two data sets of non-operator landowners and farm operators from two regions in Missouri. Attitudinal, structural, and physical characteristics are modeled. Lifestyle attitude increases the likelihood of interest in all practices, excluding windbreaks. A conservative attitude lowers the likelihood of interest in all except windbreaks. Accumulator attitude was not significant. Own knowledge of the practice increases the likelihood of interest overall. Physical characteristics increased likelihood in alley cropping, windbreaks, silvopasture and forest farming. Age decreased it in alley cropping, windbreaks, and forest farming. Education was positive only in silvopasture. Advice was positive in all except riparian buffers and silvopasture.

AB  - Granivorous farmland passerines have declined in Europe as a result of agricultural intensification. Many of these species' require insects during the breeding season, the availability of which has declined in recent decades, potentially impacting on demographic rates via reduced adult foraging efficiency. Sympathetic management of foraging habitats may be crucial in promoting population recovery of farmland birds. This requires data on the underlying food availability and the way in which birds' exploit these resources. The foraging behaviour of a key granivorous passerine, the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella was investigated during the breeding season in relation to insect abundance and accessibility in key foraging habitats (cereal crops and field margins). Insect abundance differed temporally between crop types under varying management, due in part to the timing of crop development. Insect distributions exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity within cereal crops, with evidence of localised aggregations. Field margins were used heavily by foraging yellowhammers in early summer. However, margin use declined in late summer, with a marked shift to cereal crops. This shift occurred despite margins supporting higher insect abundance than cereals, and was most likely due to seasonal vegetation growth within margins, restricting accessibility to insects. At a finer patch-scale, yellowhammers selected foraging sites with short, sparse vegetation and high insect abundance. These results suggest that accessibility to food, mediated by vegetation structure, is an important determinant of habitat selection at both the habitat and patch scale. Field margins were experimentally cut to create open patches within the sward, and the response of foraging yellowhammers tested. The use of such patches increased between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently as vegetation height increased in the adjacent margin. These results suggest that open patches within tall, dense swards may increase accessibility to food for foraging birds. Nestling provisioning rates and body condition were significantly higher in the presence of experimental margin patches, possibly indicating that such patches may enable greater adult foraging efficiency. The positive response of yellowhammers to margin manipulations suggests that creating heterogeneity in vegetation structure within a habitat may be a means for enhancing food availability for farmland birds. Field margins managed within agri-environment schemes may require more frequent, targeted cutting to ensure accessibility to insects for foraging birds in late summer.

AB  - This research included: (1) a micro-watershed runoff study, (2) a soil column study, and (3) a herbicide adsorption study. Surface runoff of known atrazine and metolachlor concentration was introduced to nine 1 by 3-m micro-watersheds in an area covered with Coastal bermudagrass and nine watersheds in an area of conventionally-tilled soil. There was no difference in the amount of atrazine or metolachlor retained by the bermudagrass plots compared to the soil plots, nor was there a decrease in herbicide retention by the two plots associated with mixing of the two compounds in runoff. However, in the bermudagrass plots treated with a mixture of metolachlor and atrazine slightly more metolachlor was retained compared with the plots receiving only metolachlor. The impact that infiltration of surface runoff has on retention of atrazine and metolachlor was studied using nine intact soil columns vegetated by bermudagrass and nine with only bare soil. Atrazine and metolachlor were applied as described in the microwatershed runoff study. The leachate volume collected from bermudagrass soil columns (2274 ml) was greater than that of the bare soil columns (7 ml). The amount of atrazine and metolachlor recovered in leachate was not different between the bermudagrass and the bare soil columns. Mixing atrazine and metolachlor did not affect the amount of either compound recovered in leachate from either soil column type. The adsorptive capacity of bermudagrass, Weswood soil, and Houston Black soil was determined using a single-point Kd study. The adsorptive capacity (Kd ) of bermudagrass for atrazine (86) and metolachlor (131) was greater for both compounds than the adsorptive capacity of the Houston Black or Weswood soils. Mixing of atrazine and metolachlor appeared only to influence the adsorption of metolachlor to the Houston Black soil through enhanced adsorption. Results from these studies show that infiltration is one of the primary mechanisms by which filter strips reduce herbicide concentrations in surface runoff and bermudagrass has an affinity for atrazine and metolachlor. Also, once saturated, bermudagrass filter strips can lose their effectiveness. Therefore, bermudagrass filter strips have limitations that require further research to explore these limitations.

AB  - Three insect groups, known from the literature, were confirmed to make up a seed pest complex in fields of cowpea, Vigna unguiculata, in the southern part of Benin (West Africa), the main cowpea production zone of the country. Several species of heteropteran pod sucking bugs (PSB), two lepidopteran species, namely Maruca testulalis (Geyer) and Cydia ptychora (Meyrick) and the weevil Apion varium Wagner occurred throughout the area of the present study, which was carried out between 1990 and 1993. Seed damage assessment at harvest showed that the PSB are the most important cowpea seed pests in most fields. Considerable seed damage could be recognized in all stages and reflected the variable pest infestations during a cropping season. A detailed assessment of seed damage factors leading to the construction of seed life tables was carried out. For this purpose, an analytical approach based on the concept of competing risks and originating from human demography studies was used to assess the seed damage by each of the above mentioned species during different stages of pod formation in the presence and absence of the other pests. The damage pattern created by an individual pest acting alone changed considerably when competition was taken into account. The coreid Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal was the most damaging PSB species in the majority of fields, thus particular consideration was given thereafter to this species. Greenhouse and field cage infestations showed that the shedding of cowpea pods was closely related to the seed damage sustained during the first 4-5 days of pod growth. The spatial distribution of seed damage in young pods in the field showed an aggregated pattern and a theoretical model describing such distribution was used to determine the proportion of pods to be shed at a given pest density. Age-specific life tables of C. tomentosicollis and the related species C. shadabi Dolling were constructed from observations carried out at different temperatures. A biophysical model was found satisfactory to describe the temperature-response of developmental and mortality rates of egg and nymphal stages, with a peak developmental rate around 34$\sp\circ$C in both species. Survival of eggs and nymphs remained high between 20 and 30$\sp\circ$C for both species. C. tomentosicollis performed significantly better on pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan, than on cowpea at higher temperatures, suggesting that pigeonpea is its main host plant. Analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of C. tomentosicollis showed that rapid colonization by immigrating adults closely coincided with the pod formation phase of the plants. The use of pigeonpea as a trap border stripe reduced the adult infestation level of C. tomentosicollis in a number of cowpea fields. No trap effect, however, could be recognized under low pest densities. Over the study period the level of parasitism was consistently higher on-farm ($>$70%) than at IITA Station ($<$20%), where it appeared to be enhanced in some fields by the presence of pigeonpea trap. Significant impact of natural control agents on C. tomentosicollis populations appears to be limited to egg parasitism. Two egg parasitoids were recovered from the eggs on cowpea: Gryon fulviventre (Crawford) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) and Ooencyrtus utetheisae (Risbec) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae).

AB  - Positive incentive schemes have been used by the UK Government as the primary vehicle for promoting Agri-Environment integration during the last 10 years (UK Round Table, 1998). As these schemes rely upon voluntary uptake, there is a need to understand farmers' decision-making in order to facilitate their success. The Water Fringe Option of the UK's Habitat Scheme is the only riparian buffer zone policy currently in operation in the UK. This Scheme was examined in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and to generate recommendations for an effective approach to implementing buffer zone policy. This study focuses on the results of 45 structured interviews with Scheme adopters and non-adopters from the Slapton Ley catchment in South Devon, the Derwent and Rye systems in North Yorkshire and the Upper Avon, Wylye and Nadder systems in Wiltshire. As part of the analysis a 'buffer zone evaluation and inventory schedule' was designed and subsequently used to evaluate the 48 buffer zones that had been established within the selected catchments. Analysis of buffer zones included landscape, riparian land, upper and lower banks and stream channel characteristics.The key results of the study indicate that the Wiltshire and North Yorkshire catchments were physically suitable for a riparian buffer zone scheme, although, at present buffer zones are not well established in the North Yorkshire catchment. The South Devon catchment is not well suited for a riparian buffer zone scheme due to steep slopes and soil hydrology. The presence of cattle watering points, tractor rills and the invasion of neighbouring farm cattle were common problems associated with the Water Fringe Option in all three catchments.There was a 35.6% adoption rate among the farmers interviewed. The Scheme was most likely to be adopted on larger farms (> 100 ha), on farms that were 100% owner occupied, and on mixed farms (arable and pasture rotations). Farmers were also most likely to adopt if they had attended an organised meeting organised by Scheme promoters (50% adoption rate).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and use an integrated regional systems model capable of simulating rural family and community conditions and land use decisions in the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve (LABR) buffer zone in Costa Rica and Panama. The study comprised 53 regional, community, and farm-level participants and used a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including document review, individual in-depth interviews, content analysis, and frequencies. A set of 80 key conditions, the distribution of land among six land-use classifications along a conservation-development continuum, a set of 104 land use decision variables and subvariables, including those most influential in farmers' decisions to allocate land to particular uses along the continuum, and a set of seven linkages among the variables and subvariables were identified. These data were used in the preliminary deterministic multivariate integrated systems model that simulated 10 years of land use-decisions and resultant shifts in hectares among six land-use classifications of an average buffer zone farmer. The relative sensitivity of model output to changes in the model was evaluated with a sensitivity analysis of selected variables using the Panamanian scenario. The model was insensitive to changes in most variables and most sensitive to changes in the variables lumber price, coffee price, interest rates, and preference. The ability of the model to predict shifts in land use among land use classifications by country was determined through use with a factorial experimental design. Combinations of variables had effects through the timing and amount of financial resources available to farmers and certain management strategies had varying impacts on land use. Buffer zone integrated conservation and development project management strategies indicated by study data were also explored. This study provides insights into the infrequently examined and little understood land use decision-making process in buffer zones by identifying forces, underlying causes, and interactions among them that influenced land use decisions and their different environmental impacts. The model needs to be refined, but its process and results are a foundation for future refinement that has the potential to improve management for the maintenance of biodiversity.

AB  - Degradation of water quality in the streams and estuaries of North Carolina in recent years has resulted in regulations to reduce the introduction of numerous types of contaminants to this system. In the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico River Basins, excessive amounts of nitrogen have been identified as causing increased algal growth, low dissolved oxygen concentrations, and have been linked to increased growth of toxic microorganisms such as Pfiesteria piscicida . There are numerous sources of nitrogen to the basins; however, agricultural nonpoint sources have been identified as the largest contributor of nitrogen. Riparian buffers, controlled drainage, and nutrient management have been identified as effective BMPs for reducing nitrogen transport to streams under many landscape conditions. As a result, a combination of nutrient management, controlled drainage, and riparian buffer best management practices have been mandated in the Neuse River Basin to reduce the loss of agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Based on this research, several recommendations for further study are presented. Monitoring of riparian buffer vegetation plots should continue with the expectation that vegetation may have a significant impact over time as the vegetation types become established. Eventually the vegetation in the buffer will reach a steady state with respect to nitrogen in the buffer; however, this may take many years. Quantification of the relative proportion of dilution and denitrification for a given nitrate concentration decrease beneath the buffers should be investigated. One approach would be installation of redox probes at the deep well depth to give an indication if conditions are favorable (i.e. reducing) for denitrification. Also, the deep groundwater (i.e. below the impermeable layer) chemistry should be compared to the shallow groundwater chemistry to determine the relative proportions of constituents such as calcium and magnesium. This analysis would give an indication if dilution of the shallow groundwater were occurring as a result of deep groundwater upwelling. The REMM simulations may be improved by measuring groundwater velocity into the riparian buffer, improving the estimates of surface water runoff into the riparian buffers, and by modifying the model to simulate a single buffer zone rather than three.

AB  - This study increases the body of knowledge on the drought response of plant-fungal associations. Hybrid black popular Populus x canadensis, a species commonly seen in shelter belts and small plantations, is tested on its drought response to mycorrhizal colonisation. It also suggests an alternative mechanism for the alteration of plant water relations by arbuscular mycorrhiza. The concept of chemical signalling compounds which control plant response to stress, including drought stress, is topical. This study aims to extend the concept of the plant-fungus symbiosis. The ability of the fungal hyphae to act as an integral part of the root system is tested in its contribution to signalling of drought stress to the host shoot. The response of mycorrhizal poplar to gradients in water availability was tested in two ways. First the effect of changing water availability over time, as drying and wetting cycles, was examined. Second, gradients in water availability across the root-fungal system were considered. The response of poplar to drought stress was tested when inoculated with one of four species of mycorrhizal fungi. These were Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae, Gigaspora rosea and Gigaspora margarita. There was no consistent improvement in plant response to drying. However there were variations in plant response over time, and with severity of drought conditions, particularly by plants colonised with G. intraradices and Gi. rosea. Changes in the host plant nutrient status were also found. The concept of hyphal to plant shoot signalling of drought was tested with poplar inoculated with G. intraradices, grown in a specially designed microcosm. Fungal hyphae were able to grow into a separate volume of soil from which plant roots were excluded. The soil water availability around plant roots and adjacent hyphae was altered independently. The plant response in terms of gas exchange was monitored under conditions of varying water availability in each section of the root-hyphal system. In general there were no consistent alterations in plant gas exchange with changing water availability. However during one experiment possible evidence for short-term hyphal signalling to host plants was noticed. This method is suggested as a new concept for further experimentation in plant-fungal water relations.

AB  - This study summaries investigations of the diet, foraging behaviour and habitat use of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) at three roost sites in Avon and Gloucestershire. Sixty-seven individuals were radio-tracked through the night to determine their preferred foraging areas, and how they utilised habitats around the roosts. Diet was recorded by faecal analysis and was compared with insect availability at different times of the year. The results show that greater horseshoe bats used ancient semi natural woodland, woodland edges, cattle grazed pastures and well developed field boundaries both for foraging and as flight lines, to move from their day roost to suitable feeding areas. Their diet changed seasonally, and included mainly Tipulid flies, geotrupid beetles and cockchafers in spring, moths in summer and Aphodius sp. dung beetles in the autumn. Coleptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera were the main components of the diet. This was reflected in their use of habitats. They selected woodlands and pastures in spring, used meadows and pastures in summer, and spent most of their time on cattle-grazed pastures in the autumn. Juveniles foraged within a kilometre from the roost for the first week or so after leaving the roost, gradually increasing their foraging distances over a number of weeks, but continued using mainly cattle-grazed pastures to forage. Most adults foraged within four kilometres of the roost, at all the sites studied.The results of this study have important implications for the conservation management of greater horseshoe bats in Britain. Recommendations for habitat management include the provision of broadleaved woodlands, forest rides, well-developed hedgerows and cattle grazed pastures around the roost, as well as the maintenance of continuous flight lines, such as hedgerows and tree-lines, and the protection of additional night roosts which are used regularly.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips have been shown to reduce sediment and nutrient delivery to terrestrial waterways. One of the goals of this study was to construct a base line data set for a larger long term project analyzing the effectiveness of riparian vegetative buffers. A four year calibration period collecting water quality, quantity, and channel morphology data was carried out for the initial portion of this watershed scale study. Two agricultural watersheds used were entitled the "Agricultural" (AG) watershed and the "North House" (NH) watershed. Storm flow water quality was analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium-N, nitrate-N, and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). Event mean concentrations (EMCs) and storm event loads were developed in order to compare watersheds. The EMCs were used to create predictive regression equations across watersheds; for comparative use with the post treatment phase of the study. Similarly, seasonal differences and correlations between precipitation and discharge quantities across EMCs were examined. Biennial stream surveys were also performed to determine channel morphology changes in these agricultural watersheds. Statistical differences in EMCs between watersheds were only obtained for DRP. There were no direct correlations between precipitation quantity and event discharge with EMCs except in the AG watershed for TSS (p = 0.03, r = 0.34). Similarly, no significant differences in EMCs across seasons for any contaminant were seen in either watershed. Yearly contaminant load calculations resulted in a wide range of concentrations per hectare for each watershed across the three years. Surveys from the two watersheds, as well as the yearly contaminant loads, revealed that the AG watershed had larger amounts of sediment transport occurring in its main channel than did the NH watershed. This is possibly due to the fact that the AG watershed lacked riparian vegetation along its channel, whereas the NH watershed was able to maintain a substantial grassed waterway. The second facet of this study looked at the propagation of a unique riparian buffer species called giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea ssp. gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.]. Giant cane is a native riparian species to southern Illinois as well as much of the Southeast. Giant cane's performance as an effective filter of sediment and nutrients from surface and subsurface flows has been recently documented; however, it has proven difficult to establish in riparian zones (Schoonover et al., 2011). Thus, the purpose of this additional study was to look at a new approach for restoring giant cane in buffer zones. Giant cane, hardy to zone 6, has gained a lot of support from state and regional agencies for its reestablishment on the landscape. This study focused on developing a low-cost method for giant cane restoration designed to give reproductive propagules a head start at becoming a successful canebrake. To achieve this goal, three varieties of sand bags (i.e., polypropylene, treated burlap, and non-treated burlap) were utilized as growing containers for giant cane rhizomes. Along with the differing bag types, two soil mixes as well as a fertilizer treatment were assessed for their influence on cane survival and growth. Results showed that the non-treated burlap/mixed media/ no fertilizer combination provided the best growing environment for newly established giant cane rhizomes. This combination's ability to provide sufficient soil moisture and bag permeability labeled it as the most promising method for successful budding and survival.

AB  - Computer simulation models are regarded as important tools to address concerns about the environmental impact of agricultural activities and have increasingly been used to complement field research. The CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, two of the main crop growth models incorporated into the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were developed to simulate the effects of environmental conditions, different management strategies, and genetics on crop growth and development. These models currently do not have an option for calculating erosion and phosphorus (P) dynamics. In this study, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and sediment-bound P model were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean models. The evapotranspiration component of the CERES model was also evaluated to test the ability of the model to simulate the effects of shelterbelts on corn transpiration. Two years of sap flow data collected from corn plants in a sheltered (3H) and unsheltered (25H) areas in a field near Ogden, Iowa, were used for model testing. Results showed that the CERES-Maize model simulated daily plant transpiration well in both sheltered and unsheltered areas with RMSE of 0.53mm d -1 (3H) and 0.75mm d-1 (25H) in 2001, and 0.85mm d-1 (3H) and 0.59mm d-1 (25H) in 2002. Average coefficient of determination (r2 ) for 2001 and 2002 was 0.90 and 0.73, respectively. After erosion and sediment-bound P subroutines were incorporated into CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean, the models were calibrated and tested using five years of data collected from two field sites in a watershed in Tama County, Iowa. Results showed that generally both models tended to over or underpredict daily sediment and sediment-bound P losses from fields, but they simulated seasonal values reasonably well. For CERES model, the error between simulated and measured seasonal sediment losses was less than 10% in three out of the five years, while in four out of the five years, the difference between simulated and measured sediment loss was less than 15% for the CROPGRO. The study indicated that both models did not seem to give good estimates of daily sediment and P losses, but they can be used to simulate the long-term (seasonal) losses with reasonable accuracy.

AB  - Maintaining flows and quality of water resources is critical to support ecosystem services and consumptive needs. Understanding impacts of changes in climate and land use on ecohydrologic processes in a watershed is vital to sustaining water resources for multiple uses. This study completes a continental and regional scale assessment using statistical and simulation modeling to investigate ecohydrologic impacts within watershed systems. Watersheds across the continental United States have diverse hydrogeomorphic characters, mean temperatures, soil moistures, precipitation and evaporation patterns that influence runoff processes. Changes in climate affect runoff by impacting available soil moisture, evaporation, precipitation and vegetative patterns. A one percent increase in annual soil moisture may cause a five percent increase in runoff in watersheds across the continent. Low soil moisture and high temperatures influence runoff patterns in specific regions. Spring runoff is increased by the influence Spring soil moisture, Winter and Spring evaporation, and Winter and Spring evaporation. Spring runoff is decreased by increases in Winter and Spring temperatures and increases in the vegetation index. Winter runoff is affected by maximum vegetative index, temperature, soil moisture, evaporation and precipitation. Contributing factors to runoff are influenced by geomorphic and seasonal variations requiring strategies that are site-specific and use system-wide information. Regional scale watershed analysis investigates the influence of landscape metrics on temporal streamflow processes in multiple gauged watersheds in Massachusetts, U.S.A. Time of concentration, recession coefficient, base flow index, and peak flow are hydrologic metrics used to relate to landscape metrics derived using FRAGSTAT software. Peak flow increases with increasing perimeter-area fractal dimensions, and Contagion index and decreases as Landscape Shape Index increases. There was an increasing trend in the fractal dimension over time indicative of more complex shape of patches in watershed. Base flow index and recession coefficient fluctuated from low to high decreasing recently. This could be indicative of open space legislation, conservation efforts and reforestation within the state in the last ten years. Coastal systems provide valuable ecosystem services and are vulnerable to impacts of changes in climate and continental land use patterns. Effects of land use and climate change on runoff, suspended sediments, total nitrogen and total phosphorus are simulated for coastal watersheds around the Boston Bay ecosystem. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, a continuous-time, semi distributed, process-based model, is used to simulate the watershed ecohydrologic process affecting coastal bodies. Urbanization in watersheds increased runoff by as much as 80% from the baseline. Land use change poses a major threat to water quality impacts affecting coastal ecosystems. Total nitrogen increased average of 53.8% with conservative changes in climate and land use. Total phosphorus increased an average of 57.3% with conservative changes in land use and climate change. Climate change alone causes up to 40% increase in runoff and when combined with a 3.25% increase in urban development runoff increased an average of 114%. Coastal ecosystems are impacted by nutrient runoff from watersheds. Continued urbanization and changes in climate will increase total nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended sediments in coastal ecosystems. Continental scale runoff is affected by soil moisture and vegetative cover. Cover crops, low tillage farm practices and natural vegetation contribute to less runoff. Developing policies that encourage protection of soil structure could minimize runoff and aid in maintaining sustainable water resources. Best Management Practices and Low impact development at the national level with continued stormwater legislation directed towards sustainable land use policy will improve water quantity and quality. Fragmentation obse ved in Massachusetts increases the number of urban parcels and decreases the size of forested areas. Faster runoff patterns are observed but recent land management may be changing this runoff pattern. Municipal and state zoning ordinance to preserve open space and large forest patches will restrict urban growth to specific regions of a watershed. This could improve quantities of water available to ecosystems. Increases in total nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended sediments to coastal ecosystems can be minimized with use of riparian buffers and Best Management Practices within coastal watersheds. Urbanization and climate change threatens coastal ecosystems and national policy to preserve and restrict development of coastal areas will preserve coastal ecosystem services.

AB  - <p class=Abstract>The tension between conservation objectives and local people¿s need for visible livelihoods is complex and often difficult to resolve. In 2000, the Knuckles Conservation Area was established to include a protected area and a buffer zone to be used for management and restoration. Prior to this decree, small tracts of land in the buffer zone were used for vegetable cultivation by villagers to supplement production from their titled agricultural plots. An ethnographic approach was used in seven villages to explore how households have adapted their livelihoods in response to the change in land, and to examine the factors that may help understand the differences in the livelihood activities chosen. The fundamental needs of the local people in their use of natural resources were not addressed when cultivation in the buffer zones was banned in 1990, creating shortfalls in production for some households, but stimulating others to diversify and invest in higher value crops in their own plots. Physical, financial, human, and natural assets other than land were important to households as they responded to and coped with change. Long-term livelihood strategies are dependent on more than just access to assets; the variability of farm and non-farm livelihood activities observed between households is explained by social and cultural factors. Power relations within the community, personal characteristics of actors such as motivation and risk taking, and local laws and modes of governance all influence, to varying degrees and in complex and multiple ways, how households transform and utilise their assets. The ability to transform assets is also dependent on the dynamics of the household: age and gender, status, social standing, and caste. When conservation initiatives are implemented, programmes need to cater for variability among households in terms of their capacity to adapt to reductions in access to land, and in terms of their aspirations for diversifying their livelihood.</p>

AB  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of the potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) were studied in alfalfa over 2 years, and the potential of using rubidium as a marker was examined. Population growth was modeled as a function of days after harvest. Inverse distance (1/d4 ) proportion maps showed relatively stable locations of population growth at low densities. A higher proportion of the population was in the edge relative to the interior plots in three of four alfalfa growth cycles. Immigrants captured from above the boundary layer contributed to population growth throughout the second, and into the third, alfalfa growth cycle. Sex ratios were initially female biased with the degree of bias decreasing over time. Spatial correlation between females and males was initially low but increased as densities increased. Spatial correlation between females and males and between nymphs and adults decreased immediately following alfalfa harvest, and then increased over time after harvest. Correlograms characterized within-field spatial variability. Within-field spatial dependence increased as time after harvest and density increased. Harvest itself showed a negative short-term effect on the spatial dependence of both life stages. Spatial correlation between leafhopper densities and plant and field parameters (percent crude protein, alfalfa density, alfalfa height, field elevation) were low. Foliar sprays of rubidium, easily enriched alfalfa foliage, but concentrations in E. fabae sufficient to be considered marked remained in the insect for only about one to two days after transfer from rubidium-enriched material when acquisition occurred as adults or as nymphs. Higher proportions of density were concentrated in edge relative to interior plots, even in narrow, rectangular fields, in three of four alfalfa growth cycles. The exception occurred at very high densities. This field-scale spatial pattern suggests that edges should be taken into account and not considered an artifact of the general population when monitoring or managing E. fabae . In this sense, site-specific IPM may have relevance for even a relatively mobile pest in specific cropping systems or at larger field scales and supports the importance of targeting control at E. fabae aggregations or at increasing management along field edges.

AB  - Yellow-headed (Amazona oratrix) and Red-crowned (A. viridigenalis) Parrots are threatened endemic species that occur sympatrically with the Red-lored Parrot (A. autumnalis) in northeast Mexico. They suffer from pressure of habitat loss and harvest for trade. I used a comparative approach to test predictions that sympatric species would differ in use of nest cavities, distribution of nests, clutch size and mortality factors. The study site was in a disturbed habitat mosaic including cattle pastures with trees (83% by area). The study site was divided into four vegetation patch types that differed in tree density: forest, 44 trees/ha; shelterbelts, 27 trees/ha; wooded pasture, 16 trees/ha and open pasture, 9 trees/ha; but not in proportion of trees with cavities (30-34%). I studied 76 different nest cavities during three breeding seasons, 1992-94. Values for seven characteristics of nest cavities used overlapped almost completely among species, showed ample variability and were different only for length of entrance. The pooled sample of Amazona nests was compared with a random subsample of "suitable" cavities and no significant differences found for diameter at breast height of tree, width of entrance, depth and internal diameter of cavities. Parrots nested successfully in all four vegetation patch types. Nesting started in late March for the three species. Nest cavities previously successful appeared more likely to be reused by the same pair. There were species differences in conspicuousness around the nest in the order $A. viridigenalis > A. oratrix > A. autumnalis.$ The smallest species A. viridigenalis had the largest mean clutch size (3.4) and youngest age at fledging (53 days). Chicks were usually fed only twice a day. Fledging was approximately two birds per successful nest, but sources of mortality differed among species. Direct evidence of snake predation on chicks was obtained in five cases. A. oratrix had a large proportion (65%) of non-laying adult pairs. Roost counts at a single roosting site varied significantly across seasons, species and years. Density estimates of nesting parrots were 8.4, 6.3 and 5.7 birds per 100 ha respectively for A. autumnalis, A. oratrix and A. viridigenalis. Food sources were abundant during the breeding season.

AB  - Interest in commercially viable cellulosic biofuel production has greatly increased due to concerns regarding the sustainability of petroleum fuels. These biofuels can help fulfill escalating demands for liquid fuels and mitigate the environmental impacts of petroleum-derived fuels. Two key factors in their successful large- scale production are pretreatment (in biological conversion processes) and a consistent supply of feedstock. While research into solving the technical issues is ongoing, much less attention has been paid to solving supply chain challenges such as low bulk density of cellulosic biomass, compositional variability and seasonality of the feedstock. Currently large biorefineries face many logistical problems because they are centralized facilities in which all units of the conversion process are present in a single location. These logistical problems can be addressed using a system of distributed processing networks called Regional/Local Biomass Processing Depots (RBPDs, LBPDs or depots). These depots are strategically distributed facilities that procure, pre-process /pre-treat and densify biomass into stable intermediate products that are compatible with existing bulk commodity logistical systems. On the agricultural production side, an array of feedstocks such as corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus, native prairie grasses etc. are being evaluated as potential raw materials for cellulosic biofuel production. Additionally, management practices such as the use of marginal lands, no-till and double-cropping, riparian buffers, when incorporated in the feedstock module of the biofuels supply chain, may enhance overall system sustainability. However, thorough assessments are required in real landscape settings on regional levels before these feedstocks can be cultivated and sustainable practices can be implemented. Likewise biofuel production should be maximized and negative environmental impacts should be minimized in growing these new feedstocks. This research has two primary objectives: to propose designs of sustainable optimized cellulosic feedstock landscapes for biofuel production and to conduct integrated systems-wide life cycle analyses of these optimized landscapes combined with distributed processing and associated auxiliary processes (such as transport operations). It also aims to address pertinent current issues in the bioenergy production sector such as: avoiding indirect land use change impacts (iLUC) and the "feed vs. fuel" controversy, maximizing ecosystem services and improving the quality of water bodies. The watershed-scale optimized & rearranged landscape design (WORLD) model was created to estimate land allocations for different cellulosic feedstocks at biorefinery scale while paying attention to the aforementioned issues. In summary, this research answers several key questions in the biofuel production process regarding the advantages of distributed processing systems, the technical potential of landscapes and maximizing the benefits of these landscapes plus processing systems for environmental, economic and social incentives. The WORLD model and integrated LCAs can be used as decision making tools by growers, industries or policy makers.

AB  - As human populations rise exponentially, agricultural production systems must be adapted to sustain ecosystem function. Government administered agricultural conservation programs may actualize greater gains in ecosystem services, including wildlife population gains, if conservation practices designed to target specific environmental outcomes are implemented strategically in agricultural landscapes. I evaluated multi-scale, multi-species, and multi-season avian population responses to a targeted native herbaceous buffer practice (CP33: Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds) under the continuous sign-up Conservation Reserve Program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. CP33 is the first conservation practice targeted directly to support habitat and population recovery objectives of a national wildlife conservation initiative (Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative). I coordinated breeding season, fall, and winter point transect surveys for northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus ), priority early-succession, and overwintering birds on [approximate]1,150 buffered and non-buffered fields in 14 states (10 ecoregions) from 2006-2009. I also assessed northern bobwhite-landscape associations within each ecoregion to determine effects of landscape structure on observed northern bobwhite abundances. Breeding season and autumn northern bobwhite densities were 60-74% and 52% greater, respectively, over all survey points in the near term (1-4 years post-establishment). However, breeding season and autumn response and associations between northern bobwhite abundance and landscape structure exhibited substantial regional variation, suggesting northern bobwhite conservation and management should be implemented on a regional basis. Breeding season densities of dickcissel ( Spiza americana ) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla ) were up to 190% greater on buffered fields, whereas overwintering densities of several Emberizid sparrow species were up to 2,707% greater on buffered fields. Species sensitive to patch area or those requiring vegetation structure different from that provided by buffers exhibited limited, but regionally and annually variable responses to buffered habitats. Increased bird densities of several species in several seasons suggest wildlife-friendly farming practices delivered strategically and requiring minimal change in primary land use can benefit species across broad landscapes when conservation practices are targeted toward specific recovery objectives. Targeted conservation systems combining multiple conservation practices to provide an array of ecosystem services may be a mechanism for meeting multifarious conservation objectives and enhancing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - &lt;p &gt;This PhD thesis seeks to consider conifer forestry stream corridor design in relation to both in-stream and riparian zone biodiversity and functioning. The contribution, availability and source of basal resources within varying corridor conditions are the focus of this project. This approach is combined with surveys of community diversity on a number of key trophic scales in order to determine how the corridor characteristics and their associated resource availability, affects community structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p &gt;The effects of varying design and management of the riparian buffer zones within afforested stream systems on in-stream and overall habitat diversity and functioning remains largely unknown. The premise of this project is to consider a variety of corridor physical parameters adjacent to low-order streams within two afforested catchments in South-West Scotland, between 2003 and 2005, in order to contribute to the understanding of system functioning within the limitations of forestry land-use and management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p &gt;A number of different approaches were employed in order to define the proportional contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous material within the benthos of the stream systems. This was done in order to define resource availability, biofilm characteristics, stream functioning and the role of corridor design in influencing resource availability. Yet, despite significant autochthonous productivity, allochthonous organic matter was the primary resource utilised by many taxa. However, conversely, light regime was found to be fundamental in shaping production and community structure within these ecosystems. Consequently, here I explore a number of different trophic scale responses to riparian conditions in order to define the biotic responses to variation of resource availability, with the aim of contributing information which may aid in design and management of afforested riparian zones.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - The Assiniboine Park riparian forest is an especially attractive location for various recreational activities. The presence of water, diverse vegetation, varied topography in a relatively 'flat' land, moderated climate and wildlife enhance the recreational experience of the trail user. However, as recreational use of the Assiniboine Park riparian forest continues, the environmental and recreational quality of the resource will further diminish. There is a need for protecting and conserving this sensitive riparian system in addition to providing recreational opportunities for the public. The proposed strategy for the design and management of the Assiniboine Park riparian forest was to widen and reconnect the riparian corridor/buffer by reclaiming large areas of land within the Assiniboine Park adjacent to and within the Assiniboine Park riparian forest. Design recommendations and guidelines for riparian buffers and corridors were explored resulting in the application of a three-zone urban riparian buffer system approach to the Assiniboine Park riparian forest. Each zone serves a different biological purpose and different recreational uses are allowed in each zone. In addition, two multiple-use trails were designed taking into consideration the activity-type and location of trails within the riparian zones. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) The design and management of the Assiniboine Park riparian forest mediates between resource protection and recreation provision focusing on understanding the needs of the recreational users and the sensitivity of the environment.

AB  - The objectives of this research are to examine the effects that certain REPS measures may be having on plant and insect species diversity, and to propose a basis for the effective monitoring of the impact of REPS on biodiversity with particular reference to the establishment of baseline data. Chapter 1 deals with the development of agri-environmental policy in the EU and the emergence of the REPS. Little ecological evaluation of the scheme has been done to date, and in particular, evaluation of the scheme's impact on farmland biodiversity has been neglected. The rationale underpinning expectation that certain REPS measures should have a beneficial effect on the diversity of flora and fauna is discussed in Chapter 2. Fieldwork was conducted on 60 grassland and tillage farms in Counties Laois, Offaly and Wexford during 1999 and 2000. Equal numbers of REPS and non-REPS farms were included in the study. Selected REPS farms had been in the scheme for at least four years. Hedges, field margins and watercourse margins were surveyed using quadrat methods and pitfall trapping. Flora results are discussed in chapter 4. Chapter 5 contains the results of the pitfall trapping surveys. There was no significant difference between the ground beetle species richness of REPS and non-REPS grassland farms. Guidelines for the establishment of baseline data and for the long-term monitoring of schemes such as the REPS are outlined in Chapter 6, and recommendations for changes to the measures assessed by the research are made. These recommendations include a widening of the input-free field margin area, improved communication to farmers of the rationale behind this and other measures and a re-evaluation of the requirement to fence off smaller drains on grassland farms.

AB  - This study examined bryophyte community re-assembly and propagule availability of forest floor bryophytes in clearcut forest stands in New Brunswick. In permanent quadrats, similarity of pre- and 4 years post-harvest bryophyte communities decreased with increasing disturbance severity (microclimatic change 41% to physical damage 25%); liverworts were particularly vulnerable to local extirpation. Forest floor bryophytes which persist in refugia within harvested areas may contribute propagules to community re-assembly. Two potential refugia are patches of remnant canopy (young trees of merchantable species) and riparian buffers. Patches of canopy >1.5m high were effective refugia, providing appropriate microclimate and containing nineteen species that were potentially sensitive to forestry disturbance. Riparian buffers bryophyte community was only 58% similar to pre-harvest community overall, therefore it was not an effective refugium. To facilitate conservation of bryophytes within harvested stands, forest floor damage should be minimized, and patches of canopy should be maintained as refugia.

AB  - The productivity of nitrogen-fixing trees on acid, infertile soils may be decreased due to low phosphorus availability. Shoot pruning or grazing further constrains shoot regrowth and productivity. Two greenhouse studies were undertaken to evaluate (1) the effects of rock phosphate additions and VA mycorrhizae on growth and nodulation of Inga edulis, Erythrina sp., and Centrosema macrocarpum, and (2) shoot pruning effects on root dynamics, VA mycorrhizal infections and P and N accumulation in Inga and Centrosema on an Ultisol. Non-mycorrhizal plants required additions of between 30 to 40 kg P/ha to attain the same shoot weight as mycorrhizal plants without added P. Plants with mycorrhizae and rhizobia had significantly more nodules than plants with rhizobia alone. Shoot pruning reduced fine root biomass. The greater the intensity of shoot pruning the greater the decline in root biomass, VA mycorrhizal infection, and nodule activity. On acid soils with low P availability, additions of 20 kg P/ha coupled with plant management to encourage vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizae could significantly improve the productivity of leguminous tree and pasture species. Two field experiments were performed on an Ultisol (pH 4.3-4.4) to (1) evaluate competition between Inga hedgerows and crops in alley cropping and (2) identify provenances of Gliricidia sepium with potential for alley cropping on acid soils. Root competition between Inga hedgerows and crops became significant at 11 months after hedgerow establishment and resulted in lower grain yields from alley plots relative to non-alley cropped controls. Fertilizer application and root pruning of hedgerows significantly improved yields across the whole alley. Root competition between hedgerows and crops, and asynchrony of nutrient release from Inga prunings and nutrient demand by crops were probably the main causes for low crop yields. Gliricidia provenance OFI 14/84 showed good tolerance to acid soil conditions and produced 60% more total biomass than the second ranked provenance. Selection of 14/84 for hedgerows in alley cropping, however, will result in excessive competition with crops. The use of less vigorous provenances may improve crop yields in alley cropping.

AB  - Forested riparian corridors exist because of inadvertent habitat fragmentation or purposeful establishment to protect water quality. Previous studies have focused on the extent of a buffer required to prevent nutrient (e.g. phosphorus) enrichment of surface waters through runoff. If forested corridors are to be effective nutrient buffers, it is important to understand the patterns of nutrient deposition in buffer soils and the long-term potential for nutrients leaching via shallow groundwater. The first section of this research focuses on patterns of phosphorus and secondary nutrient enrichment and saturation within forested buffers. By testing soil cores taken across the widths of forested riparian corridors bordering active agricultural fields, I found significant declines in phosphorus concentration and saturation levels after 10m. Phosphorus saturation levels were low to moderate, and none of the buffers I sampled showed a high risk of phosphorus leaching into shallow groundwater. I also found significant declines in base saturation and cation exchange capacity, as well as in the concentrations of calcium, manganese, and potassium as distance from the edge of the buffer increased. These changes suggest that the declines in phosphorus and phosphorus saturation may be due in part to changes in nutrient cycling within the buffer and not entirely due to differential rates of phosphorus deposition. Regardless of the cause of the declining phosphorus concentrations, my data suggest that a forested buffer of 10 m is sufficient under most conditions for the protection of surface waters from phosphorus runoff, though wider buffers may be advisable if active management of the buffer is anticipated. Whether resulting from an effort to protect surface waters or as a natural consequence of human land use patterns, fragmented forested riparian corridors may be the only forest habitat available. As such, they are an opportunity to promote biodiversity within managed ecosystems, and a prime target for efforts to promote biotic integrity. Invasion by non-native plants is one threat to biotic integrity and native biodiversity that is of particular concern in fragmented landscapes. The second section of this research examines the role of corridor width in the exclusion of non-native invasive plants. Some invasive plants, being edge specialists or generalists, have been shown to be less competitive in forest interior habitats. By examining the prevalence of several non-native plants across the forested corridors of varying widths, I determined the extent to which increasing buffer width may help prevent invasive plant domination within corridors and especially along stream banks. While Japanese honeysuckle and multi-flora rose did not significantly decline across corridor widths, Oriental bittersweet and garlic mustard showed strong declines after 20 m. These findings suggest that modest increases in riparian corridor width can have a positive impact on the exclusion of some exotic species from forest interiors and may help to improve the biotic integrity of these habitats.

AB  - Forested riparian corridors exist because of inadvertent habitat fragmentation or purposeful establishment to protect water quality. Previous studies have focused on the extent of a buffer required to prevent nutrient (e.g. phosphorus) enrichment of surface waters through runoff. If forested corridors are to be effective nutrient buffers, it is important to understand the patterns of nutrient deposition in buffer soils and the long-term potential for nutrients leaching via shallow groundwater. The first section of this research focuses on patterns of phosphorus and secondary nutrient enrichment and saturation within forested buffers. By testing soil cores taken across the widths of forested riparian corridors bordering active agricultural fields, I found significant declines in phosphorus concentration and saturation levels after 10m. Phosphorus saturation levels were low to moderate, and none of the buffers I sampled showed a high risk of phosphorus leaching into shallow groundwater. I also found significant declines in base saturation and cation exchange capacity, as well as in the concentrations of calcium, manganese, and potassium as distance from the edge of the buffer increased. These changes suggest that the declines in phosphorus and phosphorus saturation may be due in part to changes in nutrient cycling within the buffer and not entirely due to differential rates of phosphorus deposition. Regardless of the cause of the declining phosphorus concentrations, my data suggest that a forested buffer of 10 m is sufficient under most conditions for the protection of surface waters from phosphorus runoff, though wider buffers may be advisable if active management of the buffer is anticipated. Whether resulting from an effort to protect surface waters or as a natural consequence of human land use patterns, fragmented forested riparian corridors may be the only forest habitat available. As such, they are an opportunity to promote biodiversity within managed ecosystems, and a prime target for efforts to promote biotic integrity. Invasion by non-native plants is one threat to biotic integrity and native biodiversity that is of particular concern in fragmented landscapes. The second section of this research examines the role of corridor width in the exclusion of non-native invasive plants. Some invasive plants, being edge specialists or generalists, have been shown to be less competitive in forest interior habitats. By examining the prevalence of several non-native plants across the forested corridors of varying widths, I determined the extent to which increasing buffer width may help prevent invasive plant domination within corridors and especially along stream banks. While Japanese honeysuckle and multi-flora rose did not significantly decline across corridor widths, Oriental bittersweet and garlic mustard showed strong declines after 20 m. These findings suggest that modest increases in riparian corridor width can have a positive impact on the exclusion of some exotic species from forest interiors and may help to improve the biotic integrity of these habitats.

AB  - Intensive irrigation makes the Imperial and Mexicali Valleys a thriving, year round agricultural region. One by-product of the irrigated agriculture is the nonpoint introduction of sediment, pesticides, and nutrients to the surface water. In this dissertation, an erosion model, linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS), is used to quantitatively estimate sediment yield at the parcel scale. The model results in spatially disaggregate, temporally sequenced estimates of sediment yield at the parcel scale, and provide insight into the patterns and causes of sediment yielded to the drain system. Intensive row crops are found to contribute 65% of all sediment in the study area. Further analysis shows that 20% of the parcels contribute 70% of the sediment to the drain system, and that the northern half of the study area is responsible for over 72% of all sediment generated. Similar erosion characteristics of erosion are hypothesized for the entire Imperial Valley. The implementation of best management practices, such as settling ponds and vegetative filter strips, is modeled for the study area, and the effect of these practices for reducing sediment in the drains is quantitatively evaluated. The research shows that crop-specific, parcel-scale best management practices would be most effective at reducing sediment in Imperial Valley drains.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems in South Dakota have experienced significant transformations over the last 100 years. Landscapes are currently dominated by large agricultural fields interspersed with small, isolated grassland patches. These isolated grassland patches are hypothesized to experience decreased nest survival rates for ring-necked pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ) and dabbling duck species due to small size and high degrees of fragmentation. Several natural resource agencies currently conserve grasslands throughout eastern South Dakota, but wildlife managers seek more information on how the size and spatial arrangement of grasslands affect targeted conservation strategies. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the relationship of duck and pheasant nest survival and nest density between different grassland patch sizes, (2) evaluate the effects of woody cover (i.e., shelterbelts) on duck and pheasant nest survival and nest density, and (3) evaluate how landscape composition and the spatial arrangement of landscape features affect duck and pheasant nest survival and nest density in eastern South Dakota. I located duck (n=1,008) and ring-necked pheasant (n=595) nests on 44 patches that ranged in size from 3.64 to 56.66 ha in 12 counties in eastern South Dakota during the nesting seasons of 2008 and 2009. I analyzed nest survival data in Program MARK and developed models that best explain the interactions between nest survival and vegetation variables, patch size, presence of woody cover, and landscape composition. Three out of four duck species exhibited increased nest survival in landscapes with larger proportions of grassland and wetlands. For example, blue-winged teal ( Anas discors ) nest survival rates increased approximately 10% when the wetland area increased from 10% to 30%. Ring-necked pheasant nest survival decreased significantly in areas with larger proportions of farmsteads within 1,600 m. In landscapes with 1% farmstead area, nest survival was approximately 13%, but when the farmstead area was increased to 2% nest survival decreased to 6%. Additionally, ring-necked pheasant nest survival decreased with larger proportions of cropland within the surrounding landscape. Grassland patch size, the presence of woody cover, and the distance to woody cover were weakly supported in nest survival models for duck species. However, the presence of woody cover and the distance to woody cover did not affect ring-necked pheasant nest survival. Patch size, grassland proportions, and wetland proportions within the surrounding landscape increased nest densities of most species. Therefore, wildlife managers need to evaluate current landscape composition when determining locations to implement habitat conservation strategies that are intended to maximize duck and ring-necked pheasant production.

AB  - This study assessed how well hybrid poplars grew under non-commercial dryland conditions in eastern Washington. Initially the study site consisted of 360 trees, which were planted in rows along a small stream. Surrounding the site were agricultural fields. Growth measurements (heights and diameters) of the trees were taken for a number of years, concluding when the trees were six years old. Nine different hybrid poplar clones were included. Detailed measurements were made of the amount of biomass present in leaf tissue, bark and wood for some of the trees. Because phosphorus is frequently the limiting nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and because hybrid poplars grow rapidly, it is thought that the use of hybrid poplar plantings in riparian strips would be beneficial. The physical removal of commercially useful amounts of hybrid poplar biomass would be removing phosphorus from the site, thus potentially benefiting aquatic ecosystems. The quantity of phosphorus present in various plant tissues (leaves, bark, and wood) was assessed in this study. It was found that overall, by dry weight, 0.11% of a tree is phosphorus. This value is similar to that of many deciduous trees. By calculation, the amount of biomass based on tree height and diameter as well as the phosphorus content were used to quantify the amount of phosphorus at the study site. Biomasses obtained during the study ranged from 22.0 kg to 33.0 kg for a 6-year-old tree. Similar calculations may be utilized to determine the necessary numbers of trees to be planted to result in certain levels of phosphorus reduction to stream systems. Different clone choices would result in differing biomasses accordingly. This site included some of the earliest clones selected for this dryland region. Subsequent selections indicate improved growth and probably will be of increased benefit to aquatic ecosystems in the future.

AB  - <p class=Abstract>Small patches of wild plants in arable fields can become isolated from conspecifics in the margin. An investigation into the effect of this on the pollination of four study plant species found fruit set of <i>Raphanus raphanistrum </i>was reduced when this annual species was isolated 70m from the margin in wheat fields. Isolation of the perennial <i>Glechoma headracea </i>50m from oat-field margins resulted in a reduced fruit and seed set. No effects were found in the annual <i>Papaver rhoeas </i>or the perennial <i>Primula veris. </i>Insect visitation was similar in both edge and isolated plants except in the case of <i>P. rhoeas </i>in which flower visitation was lower in isolated plants.</p> <p class=Abstract>Additional treatments were included in some experiments. Insect visitation, fruit and seed set of <i>R. raphanistrum </i>placed in adjacent wheat and oilseed rape fields were not affected by the crop type. Also, insect visitation, fruit and seed set measurements were the same for plants of <i>G. hederacea </i>whether placed at ground level or raised to the same height as the surrounding oat crop.</p> <p class=Abstract>The fruit set of the naturally-pollinated plants in each of the field experiments was found to be significantly lower than hand pollinated plants suggesting pollen limitation. There is concern that pollen limitation may constrain the population growth of some plants. An exploration of the seed bank dynamics of <i>R. raphanistrum </i>indicated that this species may have a seed limited population growth but further study including a full sensitivity analysis is needed.</p> <p class=Abstract>The findings are discussed in relation to current approaches to wild plant and functional biodiversity enhancement in arable areas. Recommendations are made for future research on pollinator behaviour and pollen flow.</p>

AB  - High severity fire is a historical and integral disturbance process in coniferous forest types. Compounded disturbances such as multiple fires or post-disturbance management activities are increasingly common, but ecological responses are not well understood and may represent novel types of disturbances. I studied bird and small mammal communities in the mixed severity fire regime of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon, USA, at various points in time after one or two high severity fires in and around the historic 200,000-ha Biscuit Fire. Post-disturbance time intervals included 2-4 years after a single fire, 17-18 years after a single fire, 2-3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Additionally, I examined the response of these communities to postfire salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire. Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Among the recently burned habitats, bird density was highest 17-18-years after fire and lowest 2 years after a single fire. Sites 17-18 years postfire were dominated by broad-leaved shrubs. Ordination of community data revealed two distinct gradients in avian species composition, one relating to tree structure (live, dead-sound, dead-decayed) and another relating to shrub volume and height. Bird density was positively related to shrub height and volume; increases in broad-leaved plants following fire were associated with significant increases in bird density. Immediately after a single high severity fire event, small mammal communities transitioned from low abundance and high species richness to high abundance and low species richness dominated by deer mice. Partial recovery to a pre-burn state was evident 17 years after fire with wood rats being present but vole species still absent relative to unburned mature forest. Repeat fire was associated with heightened abundance of deer mice and herbaceous cover. Postfire salvage logging created a significant pulse of woody debris but no significant changes in densities or biomass of small mammals were observed. Fire effects on small mammal communities were much larger than those of postfire salvage logging in the short term. Longer term studies of changes in small mammal communities following salvage logging are needed over decades and greater time scales to fully evaluate the impacts of the management activity. To examine bird response to postfire salvage logging, we used point counts to measure changes in densities and occurrence for 17 common bird species. Response was measured at two spatial scales (20 ha and 2 ha) relative to two measures of salvage logging: proportion of surrounding area logged and logging intensity (basal area removed). The 20-ha scale comprised the logging unit as well as unit edges and surrounding unlogged areas, while the 2-ha scale comprised only the logging unit and not surrounding edges. At the 20-ha scale, we found a positive response in the density of shrub-associated species (house wren, lazuli bunting, black-headed grosbeak [scientific names given in Appendix A]) and edge-associated species (olive-sided flycatcher, yellow-rumped warbler) and little evidence of negative responses, save for a reduction in density of Hammond's flycatcher. At the 2-ha scale, shrub-associates again responded positively but not edge-associates. Brown creeper responded negatively at the 2-ha scale and five species had suggestive negative trends but they were not significant suggesting that, except for shrub nesting species, bird use of salvage units is associated with edges and not interior portions of salvage units. The lack of a strong negative response to salvage logging of the Biscuit Fire suggests that the small logging unit sizes relative to the burn area, as well as extensive snag retention in riparian buffers, tended to retain many bird species in the burn landscape.

AB  - Very high infestation levels of Thrips tabaci Lindeman were observed on onions at Ste-Clotilde (Quebec) with seasonal means of 149 and 161 thrips/plant for 1988 and 1989 respectively. No significant differences in thrips densities were detected among six yellow onion cultivars (Capable, Flame, Norstar, Progress, Rocket, Taurus) through weekly comparisons in 1988 and biweekly comparisons in 1989. A new variable, the cumulative number of thrips-days/plant, was used to model the impact of T. tabaci on onion yields. This variable allowed for better-fitted models, especially in 1989 where greater variability of the onion yields was observed. A modified Gompertz equation gave the best fit for 1988. No yield reduction due to T. tabaci was observed up to the 1000 cumulative thrips-days/plant point, beyond which the thrips impact first increased with the feeding pressure and then gradually decreased to a minimal level corresponding to a yield loss of 43%. In 1989, thrips impact was immediate and best described by an exponential model with a maximal yield loss of 34,5%. Economic thresholds of 964 and 251 cumulative thrips-days/plant were calculated for 1988 and 1989 respectively. Converted to thrips/leaf these correspond to 2,2 and 0,9 thrips/leaf. This conversion could facilitate their use in a field situation. Spatial distribution of T. tabaci was analyzed in ten commercial onion fields. Within field, density was homogeneous in the majority of cases. In some fields, higher thrips densities were temporary (two consecutive weeks at most) in one or two field margins. The Iwao method was used to calculate the acceptance boundaries of sequential sampling plans for the economic thresholds of 0,9 and 2,2 thrips/leaf and onion growth stages of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 green leaves.

AB  - The Copper Lake Buffer Zone Study was initiated in 1994 to evaluate the effects of forest harvesting practices on mammalian, avian and piscine assemblages in a small watershed. Three headwater streams within the Copper Lake watershed received different harvesting treatments; i.e., harvested with no riparian buffer, harvested with a 20 m riparian buffer and not harvested (essentially a buffer of at least 100 m). Summer trapping studies of small mammals, i.e., masked shrews (Sorex cinereus), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), prior to harvesting indicated that these species were initially low in abundance. Within the 20 m buffers, shrew abundances were significantly higher than in the adjacent clear-cuts. M. pennsylvanicus and P. maniculatus showed slight increases in harvested areas. Winter track data for other mammalian species, i.e., pine marten (Martes americana), weasel (Mustela erminea), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), indicated that prior to harvesting, winter activity was generally higher in the forest than at the stream edges. After harvesting occurred, I found that more activity occurred in residual patches of forest, including riparian buffers, than in the clear-cuts. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Conservation buffers, areas of non-crop vegetation integrated into agricultural landscapes, enhance many agroecosystem services. Among other benefits, these buffers provide habitat for wildlife and beneficial organisms such as pollinators and pest enemies. However, non-crop vegetation in agricultural settings can also be a source for crop pests. One buffer strategy, fallowing strips of land adjacent to crop fields, provides critical habitat for threatened wildlife species, but fallow strips may increase in-field weeds by creating a reservoir of weed seeds that spreads into the adjacent crop. Fallow buffers also offer few resources for beneficial organisms that provide important pest management services. It has been suggested that conservation buffer practitioners move away from fallowing towards plantings of native forbs and grasses. Planted buffers provide more resources for beneficial organisms while maintaining good habitat conditions for wildlife. It is not clear, however, how these planted buffers augment or diminish weed dynamics in the agricultural landscape. Ecological weed management, an integration of many indirect weed management strategies, can be of critical importance to organic growers who are restricted from using conventional weed management tools. The first two studies of this dissertation examined multiple field edge strategies to determine if they have an impact on ecological weed management in organic cropping systems. The first study investigated how the bank of weed seeds in the soil (the 'weed seedbank') changed over time in relation to field buffer management, distance away from the field edge, and crop type. Results showed how planted buffers, especially those with native warm season grasses, can reduce the number of weed seeds that enter the seedbank. The second study examines how ground dwelling, seed eating organisms ('weed seed predators') to the different field buffer management schemes. The results from this study showed that field buffers had little to no influence on weed seed predators or on the seed predation services they provide. However, crop type did heavily influence these organisms as well as seed removal. Fields with crops that provide dense cover, such as hay, experienced more weed seed predation than fields that were more open and had less vegetative cover, such as harvested maize fields. The results from this weed seed predation experiment, however, may reflect conditions that are specific to our system and to the southeastern United States. One important aspect of the Southeast in relation to weed seed predators is the recent introduction of the invasive red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. Although this ant is now present in high numbers inside southeastern U.S. agricultural fields, it is not clear if they are contributing to weed seed predation services. The third study of this dissertation used video monitoring in an agricultural field to collect direct evidence of Solenopsis invicta and their impact on summer annual weeds. The video data suggest that this ant is not contributing to weed seed predation services. It is not clear from the video data, however, what impact these invasive ants have on native weed seed predators.

AB  - Denitrification removes nitrogen from watersheds under reducing conditions, but N2 O and CH4 , both greenhouse gases, can also be produced. The overarching hypothesis of my thesis was that hydric environments accumulate N2 O and CH4 in groundwater and the vadose zone. To test the hypothesis, groundwater samples were taken monthly during 2007-2009 at 64 piezometers in 10 wetlands for analysis of excess N2 , N2 O, CH4 , and CO2 . Vadose zone gas and groundwater samples were taken during 2008-2010 at two riparian buffers and a hydrologically restored wetland. The hydrology of the 10 locations was complex. A hydrologic connection across a transect was determined at one location where NO3 - significantly decreased, excess N2 significantly increased, and moderate concentrations of N2 O and CH4 accumulated. Within these 10 locations, three N2 O and four CH4 hot spots were identified, and hot moments accounted for a large percentage of total accumulated N2 O and CH4 . I found evidence of CH4 ebullition, the production of CH4 bubbles in the vadose zone that strip other dissolved gases. The locations that accumulated the most dissolved CH4 and N2 O were natural wetlands and riparian areas, respectively. I measured both positive and negative excess N2 concentrations in the vadose zone. Flux estimates ranged from -600 to 880 kg N ha -1 yr-1 , which brackets missing N estimates at the watershed scale. These concentrations were calculated using N2 /Ar, and both gases are affected by physical processes. These calculated excess N2 profiles could have been produced through either biological and/or physical mechanisms, and these processes currently cannot be distinguished. Less than 1% of the missing N on the transect scale, measured as the difference in N concentration between two piezometers, was accounted for by calculated diffusional fluxes from groundwater to the vadose zone. The primary mechanism transporting gases from the vadose zone to the atmosphere was diffusion, but convection transported 20% of the calculated median CO2 yearly flux. Increased production of N2 O and CO2 was observed in the vadose zone after rainfall events. Overall, large concentrations of N2 O, CH4 , CO2 , and excess N2 accumulated in the groundwater and vadose zone of these locations, supporting the overarching hypothesis.

AB  - Scope and method of study. The primary focus of this project was on ground beetle assemblages and abundances in wheatfields and how farm management practices and landscape structure affected these beetles. An individual field scale approach focused on the effects of reverting CRP lands back into wheat and livestock production. Here the focus was on the influence of within-field differences in management practices, particularly crop selection and tillage. I examined relationships of ground beetle assemblages in wheatfields and adjacent grasslands and riparian strips in relation to annual, seasonal, and habitat variation. Pitfall traps were used in all studies. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to differentiate ground beetle assemblages. Findings and conclusions. More beetles were captured in no-tillage wheat (WNT) and unmanaged Old World bluestem (OWBM) plots than in minimum-tillage wheat (WMT) and managed Old World bluestem plots (OWBUM). The WNT and OWBM are intermediate disturbance levels between WMT and OWBUM, and had the greatest effect on ground beetle assemblages. At a landscape scale, grasslands and riparian zones were examined for their affects on ground beetle assemblages in adjacent wheatfields. These habitats are believed to be sources for beetle dispersal into wheatfields. Ground beetles were separated into autumn, winter, and spring assemblages. I found distinct assemblages of beetles inhabiting the interiors and edges of contiguous wheatfields, grasslands, and riparian zones. The assemblages in wheatfields differed with respect to adjacent grasslands and riparian zones. No consistent pattern of dispersal into and out of the wheatfields were observed. However, several species that were marked and recaptured routinely crossed the wheatfield-grassland and wheatfield-riparian boundaries. Ground beetles crossing the boundaries resulted in increased numbers in the wheatfield interiors in late winter through spring. The species collected in this study provides a rich database for more detailed research on the ecology and life history of individual species.

AB  - Results from a residual bioassay procedure for monitoring insecticide resistance in populations of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), for the purposes of predicting control failures, were related to insecticide efficacy in North Carolina potato, Solanum tuberosum L., fields in 1989 and 1990. A binomial classification, where each bioassay unit was classified as resistant or susceptible by visual inspection, provided a rapid and accurate method of predicting mean mortality in the bioassay. The proportion of units in a sample classified as resistant was the criterion used to predict the likelihood of a control failure. In 1991, this approach was validated, and additional tests revealed that a higher bioassay concentration would more reliably and easily predict the likelihood of a control failure. The utility of our approach to evaluating resistance monitoring data and a two concentration bioassay strategy are discussed. Further analysis of bioassay data from 1987 to 1990 studies revealed significant correlations between mean bioassay mortalities for different insecticides which were concluded to be cross-resistance between insecticides within the same insecticide class (carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) and multiple resistance between insecticides from different classes. Studies of the seasonal history of Colorado potato beetle populations in eastern North Carolina were conducted from 1989 to 1991. Emergence of overwintered adults and population trends were related to heat unit accumulation. Beetle and host plant densities were low throughout the summer after potato harvest. First generation adults fed potato plants oviposited and were more active than tuber fed adults which never oviposited. Adult overwintering survivorship varied by food source: potato plants (66 to 70%), tubers (0 to 14.3%), and no food (0 to 8.3%). Intensive sampling of commercial potato fields in 1990 and 1991 indicated that adult colonization and oviposition patterns varied with crop rotation but that infestations began at field edges and progressed inward. Management of potato beetle populations is discussed in light of these findings.

AB  - In order to investigate competition for light between trees and crops in an agroforestry system, we combined simulation modeling with field experiments. Biomass, leaf area, and width of hedgerows of Flemingia macrophylla were less when grown as an alley crop with maize (Zea mays) than when grown alone. The population of shoots from the hedgerow trees exhibited density-dependent mortality. The slope of the self-thinning line (log number of shoots vs. log stand biomass) was $-$0.5 in the first year but steeper in the second. We wrote a simulation model of hedgerow light interception (HedgeGro) treating hedgerows as regular prisms of a given geometry and leaf area and including interception of direct beam and diffuse radiation. Using the model to calculate radiation accumulated by the hedgerows and data from periodic biomass harvests, we calculated a radiation use efficiency $(\varepsilon)$ for the hedgerows of 0.18 g above ground biomass/mol photosynthetic photons. Since there was no difference in $\varepsilon$ between the sole hedgerows and the intercropped hedgerows, we conclude that the competitive effect of the maize on the hedgerows was solely caused by shading. We then modeled growth of the hedgerows based on intercepted light, $\varepsilon,$ self-thinning of shoots, and allometric equations relating average shoot size to hedgerow height, width, and leaf area. To study the effect of competition for light alone versus combined above and below ground competition on maize growth, we constructed vertical shade barriers out of shade cloth and compared maize growth between these barriers with maize growth in the alley crop and as a sole crop. Maize grain yields ranged from 0 t/ha in rows adjacent to the hedgerows to 6.4 t/ha in rows in the center of the alleys, as compared with average yields of 7.7 t/ha in the sole crop. Radiation use efficiency for the maize calculated from periodic harvests and accumulated radiation given by the model averaged 0.75 g biomass/mol photons with no significant differences among the three treatments. We therefore conclude that the tree-crop competition was overwhelmingly for light in this experiment.

AB  - Agriculture is currently the leading cause of stream impairment in the United States. As the population continues to grow as well as the demand for biofuels, more pressure is being exerted on land to produce greater quantities of food. To satisfy the need for increased production marginal forest and grasslands have been converted to agriculture, fertilizers and equipment have rapidly evolved, and land has been taken out of conservation programs. Unfortunately, water quality impairment often accompanies these efforts to increase crop production. To reduce the impacts of agriculture on water quality, best management practices (BMPs) have been developed and tested at the field scale, with fewer studies focusing on the effects of agricultural land cover and BMPs (e.g., riparian buffers) on water quality at the watershed scale. Thus, a study was designed to assess the effects of riparian buffers and agricultural land cover on water quality at the watershed scale. Within Richland and Silver Creek watersheds, tributaries of the Lower Kaskaskia River Watershed in Illinois, forty-three catchments ranging from 12 to 50 km 2 were selected across an agricultural to urban land cover gradient. Between January 18, 2008 and August 3, 2009, grab samples were collected twice a month during the wet portion of the year and once a month during the dry portion of the year and analyzed for nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, and orthophosphate), bacteria (total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli ), and total suspended solids (TSS). Correlation analyses were performed on the data to determine relationships between the water quality variables, whole-catchment land cover (agriculture, forest, and urban), and percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of the stream using two different stream layers (National Hydrologic Dataset (NHD), and Flow Accumulation Boundaries (FAB)). Also, riparian buffer characteristics were quantified in headwater streams to determine if they were more highly correlated with water quality variables than in larger order streams. The percent of agricultural land cover within a watershed was significantly correlated with TSS (r = 0.4556, p = 0.0021) and ammonium-N (r = 0.3043, p = 0.0473) during baseflow, and TSS (r = 0.2837, p = 0.0652), ammonium-N (r = 0.5306, p = 0.0003), nitrate-N (r = 0.2654, p = 0.0854), and orthophosphate (r = 0.3783, p = 0.0124) during stormflow. Total amount of enrolled Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land within Richland Creek and Silver Creek watersheds were found not to be correlated with water quality. A possible reason for these results could be because only a very small percent of lands in Richland Creek and Silver Creek were enrolled in CRP. Whole-catchment land cover in most cases explained more variance than percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of streams for the water quality parameters analyzed. There were only slight differences between the two stream layers (NHD and FAB). However, the headwater streams of the FAB stream layer explained more variance in critical water quality parameters, ammonium-N (r = -0.5309, p = 0.002) during baseflow and ammonium-N (r = -0.6107 p <0.0001), and orthophosphate (r = -0.5273 p = 0.0003) during stormflow. Having an understanding of the impacts that riparian buffers and headwater streams have on water quality is key for watershed managers to focus restoration efforts in the most critical areas for maintaining stream quality.

AB  - Agriculture is currently the leading cause of stream impairment in the United States. As the population continues to grow as well as the demand for biofuels, more pressure is being exerted on land to produce greater quantities of food. To satisfy the need for increased production marginal forest and grasslands have been converted to agriculture, fertilizers and equipment have rapidly evolved, and land has been taken out of conservation programs. Unfortunately, water quality impairment often accompanies these efforts to increase crop production. To reduce the impacts of agriculture on water quality, best management practices (BMPs) have been developed and tested at the field scale, with fewer studies focusing on the effects of agricultural land cover and BMPs (e.g., riparian buffers) on water quality at the watershed scale. Thus, a study was designed to assess the effects of riparian buffers and agricultural land cover on water quality at the watershed scale. Within Richland and Silver Creek watersheds, tributaries of the Lower Kaskaskia River Watershed in Illinois, forty-three catchments ranging from 12 to 50 km 2 were selected across an agricultural to urban land cover gradient. Between January 18, 2008 and August 3, 2009, grab samples were collected twice a month during the wet portion of the year and once a month during the dry portion of the year and analyzed for nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, and orthophosphate), bacteria (total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli ), and total suspended solids (TSS). Correlation analyses were performed on the data to determine relationships between the water quality variables, whole-catchment land cover (agriculture, forest, and urban), and percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of the stream using two different stream layers (National Hydrologic Dataset (NHD), and Flow Accumulation Boundaries (FAB)). Also, riparian buffer characteristics were quantified in headwater streams to determine if they were more highly correlated with water quality variables than in larger order streams. The percent of agricultural land cover within a watershed was significantly correlated with TSS (r = 0.4556, p = 0.0021) and ammonium-N (r = 0.3043, p = 0.0473) during baseflow, and TSS (r = 0.2837, p = 0.0652), ammonium-N (r = 0.5306, p = 0.0003), nitrate-N (r = 0.2654, p = 0.0854), and orthophosphate (r = 0.3783, p = 0.0124) during stormflow. Total amount of enrolled Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land within Richland Creek and Silver Creek watersheds were found not to be correlated with water quality. A possible reason for these results could be because only a very small percent of lands in Richland Creek and Silver Creek were enrolled in CRP. Whole-catchment land cover in most cases explained more variance than percent forest canopy cover within 50 m of streams for the water quality parameters analyzed. There were only slight differences between the two stream layers (NHD and FAB). However, the headwater streams of the FAB stream layer explained more variance in critical water quality parameters, ammonium-N (r = -0.5309, p = 0.002) during baseflow and ammonium-N (r = -0.6107 p <0.0001), and orthophosphate (r = -0.5273 p = 0.0003) during stormflow. Having an understanding of the impacts that riparian buffers and headwater streams have on water quality is key for watershed managers to focus restoration efforts in the most critical areas for maintaining stream quality.

AB  - Spatial scale affects our interpretation of the degree to which land uses in watersheds and their spatial arrangement influence stream habitat and biological integrity. This in turn determines how managers and policy makers approach restoration of degraded streams or protection of existing ones. The first objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the index of biotic integrity (IBI) and forest cover and other habitat variables in the Eastern Corn Belt Plain (ECBP) ecoregion as influenced by spatial scale. The second objective was to determine the cost and the cost effectiveness of recovering IBI scores through habitat restoration. The strongest relationship between IBI scores and forest within watersheds in the ECBP was in the 30 m adjacent to stream segments and 600 m upstream. Habitat variables derived with spatial data provided a stronger prediction of IBI than habitat variables evaluated qualitatively in stream reaches. Forested riparian area and length and steepness of slopes were the two most important predictors of IBI. The ability to predict IBI with habitat variables decreased as the spatial extent of models increased, irrespective of whether watershed or reach habitat variables were used. The cost effectiveness of riparian buffers as a restoration tool decreased with increasing spatial extent and decreasing stream order. As an alternative, in-stream-habitat restoration using half-log structures was less cost effective than riparian buffers at all spatial extents. The cost per 1 percent increase in IBI score weighted by proportion of stream orders was U.S. $360.10 for a 30-year recovery in the upper Wabash River watershed. The total cost for 100 percent buffer application in the watershed was U.S. $253,898,769.24, with 96% being the cost of restoring first- to third-order streams. Restoration would increase IBI scores by an average of 9.95% in restored streams. Restoration of low-order streams would accumulate additional water quality benefits downstream that was not quantified. A study of the public's willingness to pay for restoration is recommended.

AB  - <![CDATA[<p class="Abstract">The first experiment investigated a combination of establishment and management methods to enhance botanical and invertebrate diversity of experimental field margins in intensively managed grasslands over a seven year period. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated including fencing natural regeneration by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin widths. <p class="Abstract">Sowing a seed mixture was the most successful establishment method to enhance plant biodiversity and this effect persisted over seven years. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in plant richness; however, it led to increased cover of competitive grasses. Fencing field margins was required to enhance resident invertebrate populations. While invertebrate richness was not affected by enhancing plant richness, there was a distinct invertebrate community in sown margins. <p class="Abstract">A second randomised factorial split-plot experiment was established in 2007, within a less intensive grassland system. Three methods of field margin establishment were investigated: fencing, sowing a simple seed mixture, or a complex wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward management by either continuous grazing or seasonal grazing, was tested at two different margin shapes, either linear or corner margins. <p class="Abstract">The complex seed mixture produced the most floristically diverse swards. Corners contained significantly higher plant species richness compared to linear margins. A reduction in grazing pressure (by reduced summer grazing) increased invertebrate abundances. However, establishment method was not found to have an effect on invertebrate abundance or richness within most groups studied, in this time-period. <p class="Abstract">Results of these experiments are discussed in the context of the practicality and effectiveness of different treatments in restoring and managing field margin biodiversity and the implications for future agri-environment policies. ]]>

AB  - As the acreage of glyphosate-resistant (GR) cropping systems increases, so does the occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds in the landscape. Biotypes of GR Conyza canadensis were first observed in Delaware, USA, in 2000. The ecology of GR C. canadensis and any potential fitness consequences of GR trait are still unknown. This research seeks to determine if differences exist in surrogate measures of fitness--patterns of growth, reproductive allocation, and competitive ability--and if so, how differences may apply to future population changes, for glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible C. canadensis. The first two experiments presented test two populations of GR plants and two populations of GS plants, first in a greenhouse study of shading effects and intraspecific competition (Chapter 2), and second in a field survivorship study within two habitat types (Chapter 3). The third study tests for the prevalence of GR C. canadensis in field margins of GR cropping systems and seeks correlations in the occurrence of resistance and factors related to geography and field management (Chapter 4). The greenhouse study (Experiment 1, Chapter 2) of surrogate measures of fitness (growth, reproduction) in response to intraspecific competitive ability and shading showed that, while all populations had the same response to shading, there were differences between populations in growth and reproduction. While all measures were greater for individual plants with no competition, plants competing with individuals from one of the GR populations (R2) often had measures that were not different from the no competition treatment or were greater than the other competition treatments (R1, S1, and S2). The field survivorship study compared growth, survival, and reproduction of the previously studied four populations of C. canadensis is two habitats, a old-field in the second year of succession (ruderal) and a soybean field planted with a GR cultivar (agrestal) (Experiment 2, Chapter 3). One of the GR populations (R1) had the highest survivorship of the four populations in the ruderal habitat, while there was no difference in survivorship of the four populations in the agrestal habitat. While there was little difference in growth between ruderal populations, in the agrestal habitat, one GS population (S1) consistently had the smallest diameter, height, and leaf number. One of the agrestal GR populations (R2) was larger than the others, though not always different from R1. R1 was the first population to senesce regardless of habitat. Both agrestal GR populations produced more capitulae (seed heads) than the GS populations, and R1 also showed high reproductive success in the ruderal habitat. A test for the occurrence of GR C. canadensis in field margins of GR cropping systems (Experiment 3, Chapter 4) utilized a discriminating spray test on seed collected from the margins of 17 agricultural fields in 2008 from Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska. The relationships between the occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins and 1) geography, 2) field management practices, 3) herbicide diversity, 4) weed community diversity, 5) field-interior changes in C. canadensis populations (λ), and 6) knowledge or suspicion of difficult-to-control C. canadensis populations, were tested. Geography was the clearest relationship in these data and was related to geography, with greater, more variable occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins in the southern and eastern sites than the northern and western sites. Management practices in field-interiors from year 2006 to 2008 had little relationship to occurrence of GR C. canadensis in 2008 field margins, except for the increased use of tillage and the increased use of non-glyphosate herbicide modes of action in 2007 field-interiors of fields with the highest occurrence of GR C. canadensis in the field margins in 2008. Additionally, the greatest occurrence of GR C. canadensis was associated with high diversity in the weed community in 2007 field-interiors. These results suggest that G C. canadensis persisted in 2008 field margins even though there was a perceivable increase in management intensity the previous year. In conclusion, although there were no differences in fitness clearly associated with the GR trait in C. canadensis, GR populations may possess equal or greater vigor in growth, reproduction, and competition as GS populations. Based on these results, GR C. canadensis may persist in agricultural field-margins or other ruderal, unmanaged habitats and act as a seed source for future field-interior infestations. Depending on the characteristics of the GR biotype, GR C. canadensis may increase in frequency in the landscape. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - The main aim of this study was to examine the influence of agricultural management regimes such as mowing and grazing on Orthoptera assemblages of improved grassland. The impact of these techniques on Orthoptera abundance/assemblage diversity and habitat variables (e.g. sward height and herbage biomass) were assessed over a 3 year period. The ecology of the most abundant grasshopper species in the experimental swards, Meadow Grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus, was also investigated. Management that is likely to be detrimental to Orthoptera populations (e.g. lead to low abundance/assemblage diversity) includes sward improvement (ploughing, reseeding), nitrogen fertiliser input and hay and silage cutting. Detrimental management regimes such as silage cutting lead to short, homogeneous grassland habitats (sward height:<100mm) in mid summer, which provide no shelter from inclement weather or cover from avian predation for adult Orthoptera. Moreover, summer cutting also results in mortality of grasshopper nymphs and adults. Inorganic fertiliser input in spring leads to tall and dense swards which have a low abundance of grasshopper nymphs due to the extinction of solar radiation near the soil surface which retards development and abundance. Management techniques such as extensive grazing that may lead to increased Orthoptera abundance on farmland are successful due to the absence of fertiliser input, summer cutting and ploughing/reseeding. The recently introduced Environmental Stewardship (ES) Scheme includes grassland management options such as 6 m buffer strips around arable fields and intensive pastures that have infrequent mowing and an absence of fertiliser input as their main features. The scheme may therefore aid the restoration of Orthoptera abundance and assemblage diversity on agricultural land in the UK.

AB  - Laboratory and field trials were established to investigate the agronomic properties of biochar in both arable and grassland situations. Biochar strongly increased arable yields when associated with higher nitrogen fertiliser levels, showing an increase in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). Biochar had no apparent impact on grass yield. Four feedstocks were identified whose use could potentially increase local biodiversity, and whose use if potentially sustainable ¿ coppiced hedgerows, undermanaged small farm woodlands, short rotation coppice willow and straw. The impacts of harvesting these on biodiversity were assessed through a combination of experiments and desk based review. The management of small farm woodlands is likely to increase sustainability. The sustainability of hedgerow coppicing depending on species groups ¿ beetle numbers increased, but small mammal numbers were not affected. These is little evidence about the impact of removing straw on soil biodiversity, but if bicholar replaces straw, straw can be harvested sustainably. The yield results from the arable trials were fed into three spreadsheet models. The first explored the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biochar use. To better understand the impact of emission timing on biochar use a novel accounting method ¿ Net Present Carbon ¿ was developed. Biochar use can mitigate or exacerbate climate change, depending on the feedstock used and the boundaries of the model. The second model looked at the net economic balance of biochar use. Depending on feedstocks, biochar can be economical to produce without carbon payments through yield gains. A final model was then developed to investigate the trade-offs of biochar use between five different sustainability objectives: fixed carbon (C), all GHG emissions, economic return, local biodiversity and global biodiversity. Overall sustainability of biochar use depends greatly on what measure is used to assess sustainability ¿ there is no scenario where it is possible to optimise all sustainability indices, instead trade-offs always occur.

AB  - Agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) have been employed for years as erosion reduction measures on cultivated lands. The ability to model the effects of BMPs at the watershed scale using a standardized process-based method provides watershed managers with an important decision making tool for addressing large-scale water quality concerns. This study uses a process-based BMP simulation method with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate five BMPs including grassed waterways, channel stabilization structures, strip crops, cover crops and vegetative filter strips on almond orchards in northern California, USA. The sediment reduction rate of the five BMPs was compared to a base case where no BMPs were applied to the watershed and analyzed for several precipitation scenarios to compare BMP effectiveness. In-channel BMPs which included grassed waterways and channel stabilization structures, reduced sediment load at the watershed outlet by 8% to 14%, respectively, depending on the annual precipitation scenario. Grassed waterways consistently outperformed channel stabilization structures, reducing sediment load by an additional 2% to 5% compared to channel stabilization structures. Upland BMPs including strip crops, cover crops and vegetative filter strips reduced sediment yield by 15 to 100% for the various precipitation scenarios. For years with median and above median precipitation, strip crops were most effective, reducing sediment yield by 63% in both cases, whereas cover crops only reduced sediment yield by 54% and 15%, respectively. For the below median precipitation year, the cover crop reduced sediment yield from fields completely (100%), whereas strip crops and vegetative filter strips only reduced sediment load by 64% and 59%, respectively. For all BMPs, a positive correlation between sediment load/yield and increasing precipitation amount and intensity was observed. The methods presented in this study are easily applicable to watershed scale studies of other basins and for other water quality concerns, such as the fate and transport of agricultural pesticides and nutrients.

AB  - The fate and transport of atrazine and three of its major degradation products were studied in a restored forested riparian buffer system to examine the effectiveness of the system in attenuating the chemicals. Concentrations of atrazine, deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, and hydroxyatrazine were measured in groundwater, surface runoff water, surface runoff sediments, and soils throughout the buffer system following application of the parent compound on a 10 x 100 m strip immediately upslope from the buffer system. The restored buffer consisted of an 8 m grass zone adjacent to the application strip, a 20 m pine forested zone, and a final streamside hardwood zone. The grass and upper 10 m of pines were most instrumental in removal of the target chemicals based on net concentrations per meter of zone width. Deethylatrazine was the predominant degradation product in both water matrices, but removal efficiency (84.2% in ground water and 92.0% in surface runoff water) was also lowest for deethylatrazine. Atrazine, deisopropylatrazine, and hydroxyatrazine each exhibited between 94.7% and 100% removal between mass loads entering the upslope landscape position beginning at the application strip and the final stream side landscape position in both ground water and surface runoff water. Loads of each analyte associated with surface runoff sediments were least efficiently removed (67.4%--100%) within the system. Adsorption of the analytes to subsurface soils was minimal in this system. It is suggested that further degradation of the analytes and plant uptake are the primary processes involved in the removal of the compounds within the system.

AB  - Thousands rely on the water of Canandaigua Lake for drinking water, fishing, boating and swimming each year. The Canandaigua Lake Watershed Council (CLWC) was formed with the goal of protecting the high quality of this water source. The CLWC has been monitoring the lake and its tributaries for thirteen years. The lake remains in good condition, but testing has revealed an overall increase in total phosphorus (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS). This study identifies potential TSS and TP sources in the Eelpot Creek subwatershed. This creek has some of the highest concentrations of these pollutants in the entire Canandaigua Lake watershed. The area was compared to the Grimes Creek subwatershed, an adjacent watershed with similar characteristics but some of the lowest pollutant concentrations in the watershed. It was posited that the paucity of riparian forested buffers contributes to higher TSS and TP concentrations in Eelpot. GIS, ground-truthing, and chemical and macroinvertebrate analyses were used to locate potential pollutant hotspots throughout the subwatershed. Results showed no significant difference in macroinvertebrate community composition, except EPT richness, between the two subwatersheds or among sites. The results did demonstrate slight impact at some Eelpot sites, and one Grimes sampling site. GIS and ground-truthing revealed several areas of concern that appear to support the macroinvertebrate results. Cultivation appears to be a probable factor contributing to pollution in Eelpot, as well as heavy stream bank erosion found along some branches. Preliminary stormwater results appear to also support these conclusions, however there were too few samples to statistically analyze the results. The results of this study support the belief that much of the TSS and TP in Eelpot Creek stems from unbuffered cultivated land and/or stream bank erosion. It is therefore recommended that forested buffers be strongly considered in protecting this valuable water source.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of agricultural changes on the rural landscape of South East Scotland, focusing upon the period between 1972 and 1990 under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Community (EC).Agricultural Returns are used to examine agricultural change at parish level and an integrated analysis of Ordnance Survey maps, aerial photographs and interpretation via GIS is used to investigate the rural landscape change in two sample areas (one in East Lothian and the second in Berwickshire). Great changes in agricultural holdings, average farm size and in land tenure have occurred in South East Scotland reflecting the effects of the CAP policies. Major agricultural changes, due to the price support policy, are found in the area under wheat, oilseed rape, oats, dairy cattle and sheep production whereas remaining crops and livestock showed no significant changes. The area under farm woodland has increased.The sample areas show major differences in the process of landscape change. Field boundaries have been removed to enlarge fields. Hedgerows and post & wire fence boundaries have been the main focus of removal. Hedgerows boundaries have been re-planted in the sample areas mostly replacing post & wire boundaries. The major removals have occurred in areas best suited for crop production but replantation has occurred in all parts of the sample areas. Other farm features have insignificant changes in sample areas.Farmers have intensified agricultural production focusing upon wheat, oilseed rape, beef cattle and sheep production. The increase of field drainage has been a major activity on the farms to increase the farm productivity. Field boundaries especially hedgerows and post & wire have been removed to increase the farm and field size.

AB  - ln Southeast Asia, biodiversity-rich forests are lost to logging, tree monocultures, and mining at an unprecedented rate. Impacts of these land-use changes are largely unknown for freshwater biodiversity. Here, I addressed questions pertinent to understanding impacts of land-use change on the region's unique and highly diverse freshwater ichthyofauna. In the first chapter, I examined possible ecological and life-history trait correlates of freshwater fish extinctions in Singapore, an example of a worst-case development scenario characterized by extensive deforestation and stream canalization. Unlike previous studies, extinctions were predicted by only local geographic range. This suggests that when streams are severely altered, local extinctions are driven by loss of entire communities, regardless of species traits. As wholesale forest loss threatens range-restricted species, the second chapter informs conservation planning for the highly endemic peat swamp forest fishes. I used the matrix-calibrated species-area model--which accounts for the ability of different landcovers to support biodiversity--to forecast extinction hotspots under different development scenarios. The establishment of oil palm monocultures is a major driver of lowland deforestation. However, no study has assessed the impact of oil palm on fishes, let alone potential mitigation strategies. In the third chapter, I sampled fish communities in streams within an oil palm plantation in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Compared to historical forest fish communities, streams surrounded by oil palm had lower species richness and functional diversity. However, retention of riparian reserves adjacent to streams mitigated these impacts. In my fourth chapter, I performed a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of riparian reserves in conserving biodiversity within production landscapes globally. My results supported retention of riparian reserves as a global conservation strategy as they retained a high proportion of species present in continuous riparian forests at both transect and landscape scales. Synthesizing these results, land-use change, particularly from forest to oil palm, negatively impacts fish communities in Southeast Asia. While peat forest conversion should be avoided as fishes inhabit the entire flooded landscape, land-sharing (between oil palm and forest riparian reserves) is effective in conserving lowland forest fishes in Southeast Asia, as well as many other taxa across different production landscapes globally.

AB  - Agricultural activity has transformed US landscapes and has had a profound impact on natural systems by altering hydrology and disrupting ecological and biogeochemical processes. Today agriculture is the largest contributor to nonpoint source pollution of ground and surface waters in the US. The benefits of agricultural conservation practices, which can mediate or reverse environmental damage, have been well documented. However, the modern US agricultural system has not adopted conservation practices at a level that can reduce large-scale environmental quality impairments. This project addresses two policy-relevant questions that natural resource managers and conservation professionals have raised repeatedly: How much will it cost to increase the adoption of conservation practices over large areas? And, how much will it cost to achieve a particular water quality outcome at the watershed scale? This research focuses on the Le Sueur River watershed (LRW), an agricultural watershed in southern Minnesota. High levels of turbidity, attributed to both geological conditions and agricultural activity, have impaired water quality in the basin, making the LRW a disproportionate contributor of total suspended solids (TSS) to the Minnesota River, which in turn contributes disproportionately to TSS loads in the Upper Mississippi River basin. A mail survey of farmers in the LRW (response rate 34%) proposed a conservation reverse auction scenario to gather least-cost incentives data. Farmers submitted willingness-to-accept bids to adopt four sediment and nutrient conservation practices on their land: no-till, conservation cover, riparian buffers, and grassed waterways. Farmers' bids and farm size data were used to build conservation supply curves, which tell us the cost of putting a certain number of acres under each practice. Using these curves, we can link cost data to expected water quality outcomes modeled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT, previously calibrated for the LRW, modeled water quality improvements under various conservation scenarios; the conservation supply curves tell us how much it will cost to implement those conservation scenarios. This interdisciplinary approach allows us to link incentives costs to conservation outcomes and to estimate the cost of achieving water quality improvements in the LRW.

AB  - Nonpoint phosphorus (P) pollution of surface and shallow groundwater is a global environmental problem, particularly in regions where animal agriculture is concentrated. In the Coastal Plain region of Delaware, over application of manures and P fertilizers have saturated soils with respect to P. One practice commonly recommended by advisory agencies to control nonpoint source (NPS) P loss from agricultural land is the vegetated filter strip (VFS). Vegetative filter strip effectiveness at mitigating NPS P pollution is usually based on quantity of stormwater infiltrated and sediment settled out of the water column. When soils are saturated with respect to P, VFS effectiveness at preventing dissolved P losses by enhancing infiltration and retaining dissolved P moving laterally through subsoil is less certain. It is therefore the goal of this research to address three key P management questions. First (Chapter 2) is to determine methods to increase soil P sorption capacity that can be included in VFS design, based on processes that control P sorption in the acid sandy Mid Atlantic Coastal Plain soils. Second (Chapter 3), is to monitor dissolved and total P flow in surface runoff and groundwater flow through VFS to determine the relative importance, and mechanisms of dissolved P transport relative to total P. Data from this study will be used both to determine how VFS function in the Coastal Plain landscape, as well as to validate the P components of the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM). Finally, in Chapter 4 the P components of REMM will be validated for use in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain region. Eight Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program VFS were selected for evaluation, representing the major agricultural soils and variability in VFS design observed throughout Delaware. Soils were collected from VFS and adjacent agricultural fields at three depths, 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm, and were characterized by routine analysis of the University of Delaware soil testing lab, as well as for soil adsorption/desorption properties. Deep tillage of the soil profile was then simulated by mixing equal portions of 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm depth soils, and mixed soils were analyzed for P sorption characteristics. VFS establishment had little effect on the soil P source component of P loss, including soil test P (Mehlich-3 P, M3) and soil P saturation (measured as the M3-P saturation ratio, PSR) relative to adjacent agricultural fields. Simulated deep tillage of VFS soils to 45 cm decreased M3-P in mixed soils as much as 62%, compared to M3-P at the 0-15 cm soil depth, and achieved maximum soil PSR reductions of 70% as compared to 0-15 cm soil prior to mixing. Vegetated Filter Strips were then established in two fields at the University of Delaware Research and Education Center, in Georgetown, DE. VFS in each field were further split into two plots, one deep tilled using a chisel plow and the other disk tilled prior to planting. Groundwater wells were installed and groundwater samples were collected weekly. Surface runoff was collected within 24 hours of each storm event. Water samples were analyzed for total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) nitrate (NO 3- -N) and ammonia (NH4+ -N). Chisel plowing was not effective at redistributing P from surface soils through the soil profile. Average surface runoff P concentrations (TP and DRP) were as much as an order of magnitude greater than groundwater P. Groundwater P concentration spiked shortly after storm events, and then quickly declined to background levels, though groundwater DRP concentration was rarely less than 0.1 mg P L -1 . Phosphorus sorption and desorption equations were modified in REMM to reflect properties important to acid sandy Coastal Plain soils. Based on strong coefficients of determination, changing these equations would be expected to improve prediction of P transport through vegetated filter strips. Simulation data were significantly different from measured data, though simulated and measured data were si ilar with respect to environmental relevance. Vegetated filter strips are an important practice to mitigate agricultural NPS pollution. In P saturated soils, dissolved P transport in subsurface flow remains an environmental concern. Further evaluation of methods to thoroughly mix the soil profile prior to planting should be investigated to improve retention of dissolved P by VFS. Models such as REMM can be helpful in designing VFS and improving placement within the Coastal Plain Landscape.

AB  - The annual value of crop pollination and biological control of plant pests provided by beneficial insects is estimated to be worth at least $22 billion to United States crop production. Beneficial insects that supply these services to agricultural lands are threatened by limited or suboptimal resources due to the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems, which is a growing concern in agricultural states like Iowa. Conservation practices are recommended to address a multitude of conservation concerns related to Iowa's declining natural resources; however, guidelines for best practices that conserve beneficial insects are not well defined. Due to the valuable relationship of beneficial insects and successful crop production, there is a need for developing best practices that conserve beneficial insects within Iowa's agricultural landscape. The first objective was to design mixtures of native perennial plants that range in diversity and resource availability and evaluate these different plant communities as candidates for buffer strips that attract and conserve beneficial insects. The second objective was to evaluate the insect community in non-crop buffer strips already established on organic farms and in the adjacent organic crops and conventional row crops. This research seeks to identify mixtures of native perennial plants optimized with resources attractive to pollinators and natural enemies and to determine if these mixtures can enhance Iowa's buffer strips to conserve beneficial insects and protect their services. Best-practices for conserving beneficial insects can be adapted for different regions, land uses, and habitat restoration scenarios beyond the study system used for this research.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for use in the Town Brook Watershed (TBW), part of the watershed system that supplies water to New York City. This system provides approximately 4.9 GL (1.3 billion gal) of water daily to over 8 million people. At present, there are water quality concerns within the system, including eutrophication, high levels of coliform bacteria and turbidity. Eutrophication is however the major problem of concern. The Cannonsville Reservoir, one of the reservoirs within the system, is greatly affected by eutrophication; this being a result of elevated phosphorus (P) loadings from the surrounding region. A major source of P is manure generated and used on farms. Previous efforts at reducing P loads to the Cannonsville Reservoir have involved an on-farm approach with a series of best management practices (BMPs) being implemented on the farms to address this problem. Current interest is in establishing the effectiveness of the various BMPs and thus the focus of the current study. This study focused on the TBW, a 3700 ha (14 mi 2 ) watershed that is part of the larger Cannonsville Reservoir Watershed. The study combined the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a related BMP tool, and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in making BMP assessments for the Town Brook Watershed. SWAT is a distributed watershed model that simulates runoff, stream flow, ground water, sediment and nutrient loading on a daily time step. The BMP tool provides a means of obtaining BMP effectiveness estimates based on site characteristics, while the GA provides a means of combining P loadings from SWAT and effectiveness estimates to optimize BMP selection and placement. The effectiveness of BMPs for the TBW was quantified both with regard to P reductions and costs. Results of the optimization favored the use of crop rotations (alone and in combination with contour strip cropping), nutrient management plans, riparian forest buffers on near-stream areas, as well as the use of filter strips as filters for barnyard runoff. In addition to barnyard runoff management systems, these constitute the major BMPs in use on the watershed. With the BMPs acting together on the watershed, phosphorus losses could potentially be reduced by 60% of the baseline load. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness (kilograms of P removed per dollar spent) of 0.04 kg/$ could be attained. This study showed that P losses could be reduced substantially even when BMPs were applied selectively (that is, to selected high P-loss areas). (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Phyllophaga implicita (Horn) is the white grub species causing root injury to field crops in the continuous cropping situations of southeastern North Dakota. Based on larvae reared in the laboratory and collected in the field, head capsule width of larvae and age structure were determined. Head capsule widths were 1.66, 2.73, and 4.30 mm for reared first, second, and third instars, respectively. The brood hatching in 1993 accounted for the highest proportion of the population in 1994 and 1995. A second study was conducted to determine the influence of crop cover on oviposition by P. implicita. Crop covers were corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.)), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.), planted in plots parallel to a shelterbelt. Soil was sampled to determine egg and larval densities. Significantly more eggs and subsequent larvae were found in soybean and corn crop covers. Shelterbelts with willow (Salix spp.), cottonwood (Populus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), and/or elm (Ulmus spp.) attract and are fed upon by adult P. implicita. A third study was conducted to determine the influence of the adult food source on the location of larval infestations. Larval densities were greatest near the shelterbelts, declining as distance increased. Logistic regression procedures were performed to assess models for predicting the probability of finding larval infestations. A model based on 1993 data predicted a 50% probability of a sample having at least 1 larva per 0.09 m$\sp2$ would occur at 40.3 m. A sampling strategy based on this model was proposed.

AB  - The effectiveness of giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.] as riparian buffer vegetation has been demonstrated through research and has gained interest from state and federal agencies to support restoration efforts. Unfortunately, little is known about the physical and chemical properties of the soils below canebrakes and how soil characteristics influence aboveground and belowground biomass production. To determine what physical attributes of the plant influence its success as riparian buffer vegetation and also to determine the interactions with underlying soils, fourteen canebrakes were sampled throughout Southern Illinois. Objective one was to develop an allometric equation to quantify belowground biomass based on aboveground parameters of canebrakes. Previous research found that successful propagation was dependent on rhizome length, the number of internodes and the number of rhizome buds present, but no data exists regarding the yield of rhizomes for a given area. By harvesting all aboveground biomass (culms and leaves) and belowground biomass (roots and rhizomes) to a depth of 25 cm from a 1-m 2 plot at each site, morphometric characteristics were quantified and biomass allocation throughout the plant was determined. A significant linear relationship between total aboveground biomass (live and dead) and belowground biomass in giant cane was evident (R=0.865, p<0.001). Although this is a strong relationship, it may be impractical for a manager to harvest, process, and weigh all of the aboveground biomass to speculate the biomass below ground. Therefore, metrics were explored for predicting the length of rhizome, number of rhizome internodes and number of rhizome buds an area will yield using multiple regression and models were developed that estimate these parameters. Using the equation that predicts the number of rhizome buds for a given area, the yield of propagules can then be estimated. Although this equation does not account for all variation of belowground characteristics, it will provide a general guideline for land managers restoring giant cane. The second objective was to estimate biomass allocation of giant cane roots/rhizomes beneath canebrakes by depth (i.e., at 25-cm increments to a depth of 150 cm). Results showed that 67% of giant cane's belowground biomass was within the top 25 cm of the soil profile and accounted for 65% of all belowground biomass encountered at that depth. Giant cane rhizomes were documented to a depth of 51-75 cm deep while cane roots existed in the deepest cores at a depth of 126-150 cm with an average density of 0.08 kg m -3 . Giant cane belowground biomass declined with increasing depth, but was still the dominant species at 26-50 cm, comprising 61% of all biomass encountered at that depth. These results support the utility of giant cane as an effective riparian buffer species by increasing the soil porosity and promoting infiltration while contributing a significant source of carbon to the soil profile. Chemical and physical soil properties were measured to determine if they related to canebrake characteristics. Significant correlations were found between various soil properties and canebrake characteristics, implying there is an interaction between giant cane and the underlying soil. Results from this research will improve our understanding of the dynamics of giant cane and supplement existing information to help guide restoration efforts.

AB  - Treefalls and abandoned agricultural fields are common disturbances in the deciduous forests of the northeastern United States. This study explores these two disturbance types individually and in combination to ascertain their role(s) in structuring forest understory communities both spatially and temporally. Abiotic and biotic variables are included in the analyses. Soil moisture, soil pH, soil seed bank, and light levels were measured in treefall gaps and under closed canopy, while controlling for microtopographic variation. Understory vegetation within permanent plots in forty-two natural treefall gaps were censused during the 1991-1993 growing seasons from May through September. Plant density, leaf cover, and species richness were compared between treefall gap and closed canopy plots for all three census years, as well as from one year to the next. Additionally, forest/old field edges were evaluated for their impact on both understory and treefall gap vegetation. Mounds within treefall gaps had significantly more soil moisture than mounds under closed canopy, and mounds were consistently drier and more acid than pits regardless of overstory condition. The soil seed bank within treefall gaps had a larger number of locally uncommon species and a greater density of Eupatorium rugosum than did closed canopy sites. There was a significant difference in plant density, leaf cover, and species richness between treefall gap and closed canopy plots for most of the growing season during most census years, except around canopy leaf out. Species composition differed little between treefall gap and closed canopy plots. Gap age and gap size minimally explain species composition within treefall gaps. Several species were found more frequently in treefall gaps, but they were also found in closed canopy plots. Additionally, understory vegetation in both treefall gap and under closed canopy was highly variable during both single growing seasons and year-to-year. Species preference for microsites was altered by the presence of a treefall gap, as well as species richness, plant density, and leaf cover on mounds and pits. Abundance of tree seedlings, exotic species, and locally uncommon species were altered along the forest/old field edge, as was treefall gap vegetation.

AB  - Migratory wildlife populations in northern Tanzania regularly move across protected area boundaries (e.g. national parks) into the grazing lands of Maasai pastoralists. Consequently, "community-based" conservation initiatives are expanding throughout the region to integrate wildlife conservation with the socio-economic needs of the Maasai and achieve "landscape" level conservation. Much of this planning has focused on scientific conservation models (e.g. wildlife corridors, wildlife-only zones), combined with benefit-sharing and education. This approach relies on and reinforces boundaries between nature and society (wildlife and people), and between scientific and local knowledge. In this dissertation I address the theoretical and policy outcomes of challenging these boundaries. I argue that successful wildlife conservation in shared Maasai-wildlife rangelands demands a complex and multi-faceted approach; one that does not seek single explanations/solutions but strives to understand complex interactions of wildlife with livestock and people within the places they move through and inhabit. I also propose the participation of different perspectives---those recognized as 'scientifically legitimate' and those historically 'Othered'---as necessary to fully grasp this complexity. I argue for the need to build dialogues between different Maasai and conservation science knowledge claims. To do so I draw from customary Maasai communication structures---the Enkiguena (a Maasai meeting). I utilize the enkiguena format to present various viewpoints and research findings (ecological, ethnographic, interview based) on wildlife whereabouts, wildlife-livestock interactions, and the feasibility of wildlife corridors. In doing so I am able to present a much wider perspective on local wildlife ecology than would be possible with a singular focus on either Maasai 'indigenous' knowledge, or scientific findings. The outcomes of these dialogues highlight the various socio-ecological parameters impacting wildlife movements, grazing patterns, and wildlife-livestock interactions. They also suggest that smoothing out complexity into simple containers (e.g. wet vs. dry seasons, corridors, wildlife-only zoned areas) risks changing what is so valuable in the first place---the continued existence of wildlife in village lands. In addition to my use of the enkiguena structure as narrative style, I argue for its value as a participatory context and a theoretical framework for exposing multiplicity and tending to complexity in social and ecological relations.

AB  - Preferential flow of water through channels in the soil has been implicated as a vehicle for groundwater and surface water contamination in forested riparian wetland buffers. Water conducted through these by-pass channels can circumvent interaction with wetland biota, biomass, and soils, thereby reducing the buffering capacity of the riparian strips for adsorption and uptake of excess nutrient loads from neighboring agricultural fields and urbanized lands. Models of riparian function need to account for preferential flow to accurately estimate nutrient flux to stream channels, but there are currently no methods for determining the form and prevalence of these pathways outside of extensive destructive sampling. This research developed, tested, and validated a new application of non-invasive ground-penetrating radar technology (GPR) for mapping the three-dimensional structure of near-surface (0-1 m) lateral preferential flow channels. Manual and automated detection methodologies were created for analyzing GPR scan data to locate the channels in the subsurface. The accuracy of the methodologies was assessed in two field test plots with buried PVC pipes simulating the riparian channels. The manual methodology had a 0% Type I error rate and 8% Type II error rate; the automated version had a <1% Type I error rate and 29% Type II error rate. An automated mapping algorithm was also created to reconstruct channel geometries from the scan data detections. The algorithm was shown to robustly track the connectivity of PVC pipe segments arranged in a branching structure hypothesized to exist in the riparian soils. These methods and algorithms were then applied at a riparian wetland study site at USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, MD. The predicted structure of preferential flow channels in the wetland was validated by transmission of tracer dye through the study site and ground truth generated from soil core samples (92% accurate). These GPR tools will enable researchers to efficiently and effectively characterize lateral preferential flow without negatively impacting environmentally sensitive wetland areas. Scientists can now directly study these flow mechanisms to investigate the effects of by-pass pathways on nutrient fate in riparian buffers and the interactions of preferential flow with plant and animal systems.

These GPR tools will enable researchers to efficiently and effectively characterize lateral preferential flow without negatively impacting environmentally sensitive wetland areas. Scientists can now directly study these flow mechanisms to investigate the effects of by-pass pathways on nutrient fate in riparian buffers and the interactions of preferential flow with plant and animal systems.

AB  - Selected field windbreak (shelterbelt) designs were evaluated to assess their cost effectiveness of providing additional crop production, carbon sequestration, and hunting opportunities. In terms of additional crop production, a three-row mixed windbreak with extensive management and low cost is the most cost effective because it requires the smallest corn yield increases to break even. Using a sheltering effect of 12 windbreak heights, the required additional yield is 0.28 Mg ha -1 yr-1 . A four-row spruce windbreak with intensive management and high costs is the least cost effective because it requires the largest corn yield increases that are 28 times larger than those of the mixed windbreak. Trees that grow faster and taller are more cost effective because they provide sheltering effect sooner and over larger distances allowing to break even with smaller yield increases that are more likely to be achieved. In terms of carbon sequestration, a four-row cottonwood windbreak is the most cost effective because it accumulates the greatest amounts of above and below-ground carbon that allow it to break even with a lifespan as short as 30 years. Only a cottonwood windbreak accumulates enough carbon to break even at a comparison price of $10.48 Mg -1 . A higher carbon price of $32.38 Mg-1 enables a mixed windbreak to break even. Spruce windbreaks (two and four rows) require higher prices to break even. Continuous CRP payments offset a significant portion of windbreak costs and allow more windbreaks to break even and at earlier times. About 55% of agricultural producers in Northeastern Iowa indicated that there is potential for fee hunting in field shelterbelts and on adjacent lands. However, they think that the potential is either weak or moderate. Almost all producers (95%) currently allow hunting. They believe that hunting is more important in providing intangible benefits such as recreation/enjoyment and better stewardship than tangible ones such as additional income and economic opportunities for the local community. On average, the producers require $22.74 per visit to allow a party of four hunters to access their land to hunt pheasants. The compensation amount is influenced more by producers' attitudes toward hunting than by socioeconomic factors.

AB  - Limited information exists on small mammals in industrial forests of northern California, USA. Small mammals are integral components of forest ecosystems serving as prey, regulating invertebrates, dispersing seeds, and as indicators of habitat quality. My thesis focuses on patch-level and fine-scale habitat elements that influence small mammal communities in industrial forests of northern California. The primary silviculture regime is small-scale (<8 ha) clearcutting followed by site preparation that includes various combinations of chemical, mechanical, and fire treatments. I trapped 11 small mammal species during the summers of 2011-2013 and collected count data on a subset of those species. In Chapter 1, I analyzed small mammal populations in 4 forest types (recent clearcuts (3-5 years old), 10-20 year-old plantations, rotation-aged stands (60-80 years old), and Watercourse and Lake Protection Zones) commonly found in industrial forests. I used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to assess patch-level (~6.35 ha) relationships between small mammal counts and commonly found forest types, and downed wood volume. Land cover composition of areas surrounding trapping webs was more influential on small mammal counts than was the forest type that contained the trapping array. Downed wood volume was positively correlated to small mammal abundance. In Chapter 2, I examined small mammal counts in relation to fine-scale (64 m2) habitat elements surrounding trap locations. I used GLMMs and found that shrub and downed wood cover were positively correlated with the number of individual small mammals captured; this relationship held across multiple taxon and trap types. This study is one of the first to be conducted on the small mammal community in industrial forests of northern California. Results of this research provide insight on small mammal populations in industrial forests and can inform timber management practices.

AB  - The feasibility of remote sensing of water status and evapotranspiration in a vineyard canopy was studied by developing mathematical canopy micrometeorology models and testing the models at three commercial vineyard sites subjected to periodic irrigation cutoff. The canopy micrometeorology models served to translate the remotely-sensed signal (infrared exitance) and on-site micrometeorological measurements into an estimate of crop water status (stomatal conductance, gs) and evapotranspiration (latent heat flux density, λE). Two classes of canopy models were examined: top-down (big leaf) and bottom-up (multilayer) models. Additionally, two variations of each model class were evaluated against one another: (1) a top-down model with single- and two-layer (soil and foliage) composition and (2) a bottom-up model with K-theory and higher order closure turbulent transport schemes. In general, the differences in the quality of the g s estimates between top-down and bottom-up models was much greater than differences between the two variations of each type of model. The bottom-up model produced more accurate estimates of gs than the top-down model at all three experimental sites. The difference was most pronounced at the 1994 site, which had more compact hedgerows than the other two sites and, hence, more bare soil exposure. At that site, the top-down model greatly underestimated g s while the bottom-up model produced good estimates of g.s Unlike the gs estimates, the quality of the λE estimates were highly dependent on the turbulent transport scheme used in the bottom-up model. The higher order closure scheme provided better estimates of λE than the K-theory scheme, the latter tending to overestimate λE. Unlike the bottom-up model, the top-down model was directly sensitive to errors in canopy H estimates as well as to errors in the measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux. Hence the top-down model tended to have large errors in its ET estimates while the bottom-up estimates (using higher order closure) were more accurate. The bottom-up model may benefit from additional research concerning the spatial and angular distribution of leaves within typical vineyard canopy hedgerows. Additional knowledge in this area may improve model performance by increasing the accuracy of radiation distribution estimates both within the hedgerow and at the soil surface.

AB  - Tall and mixed-grass prairies are being urbanized or converted to cropland at an accelerated rate. Nationwide, these losses total 99.9% for tall-grass and 70-80% for mixed-grass prairies. Previous research has shown that local vegetation structure affects habitat use by grassland birds. In addition, patch size and landscape composition affect the presence, density, and nesting success of some, but not all, grassland obligate bird species. Current trends in grassland conversion, fragmentation due to these conversions and man-made shelterbelts and degradation by exotic plant species have made grassland birds one of the fastest declining guilds in North America. Little research has been conducted on grassland birds of the mixed-grass prairie, and for many of these species, South Dakota constitutes area of highest abundance or the central portion of their breeding range. Objectives of this study were to identify: (1) local habitat characteristics, (2) habitat associations, and (3) patch and landscape level habitat requirements for grassland birds in the mixed-grass prairies of South Dakota. These objectives evaluated and determined the distribution and habitat use as related to historical ecosystem diversity for grassland birds of the mixed-grass prairie in South Dakota. I used fixed-width belt transects to survey birds on 288 native sod sites in 29 counties within central and western South Dakota during the breeding seasons of 2007 and 2008. Vegetation structure and composition were surveyed at 50m increments along each bird survey transect. Arc-GIS, aerial photographs, and the National Land Cover Database (2001) were used to calculate grassland patch size, amount of woody edge and amount of grassland habitat within concentric buffers (400m, 800m, 1600m and 3200m) around the survey points. Grasshopper sparrows (N=203) were the most common bird detected within our transects. Of the study species, Chestnut-collared longspurs had the highest male density (124 males/100ha) followed by the grasshopper sparrow (107males/100ha). I found that occurrence and density of grassland obligate bird species were influenced by numerous habitat characteristics and at multiple scales. These models showed a large variation in local vegetation characteristics being selected for by grassland bird species. Increasing coverage of grasslands by exotic plant species had a negative effect on four (chestnut-collared longspur, western meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow and lark bunting) of my focus species occurrence and/or densities, while having a positive effect on the bobolink. At the patch level, chestnut-collared longspur, Sprague's pipit, grasshopper sparrow, savannah sparrow, and western meadowlark occurrences and/or densities were negatively affected by the increasing presence of patch edge surrounded by woody species. Western meadowlarks and grasshopper sparrows were classified as area sensitive, having lower densities in small versus large grassland patches. Increasing amounts of grassland at the landscape scale positively influenced the occurrence and/or densities of Baird's sparrows, chestnut-collared longspurs, dickcissels, grasshopper sparrows, lark buntings, savannah sparrows, and Sprague's pipits. Bobolinks were the only species whose occurrence and density had a negative association to the amount of grass in the surrounding landscape. There was not only variability in the effect the landscape variables had but also at what level they were still important. Baird's and grasshopper sparrow occurrence and densities showed positive associations at the 400m or 800m levels while occurrence and densities of bobolinks, chestnut-collared longspurs, lark buntings, savannah sparrows and Sprague's pipits were influenced up to the 1600m or 3200m levels. These models supply baseline data to managers for preservation and restoration of grassland habitat to help maintain populations of grassland obligate bird species. To maintain current populations and pecies diversity, it is critical that managers preserve as much native grassland as possible. Due to the diverse habitat requirements of these species of concern grasslands should be under varying management regimes ranging from idle to heavily grazed or mowed. Reduction and removal of exotic plant species should be a key element in establishing habitat for grassland obligate species as many were negatively affected by increases in exotic plant coverage. Preserved patches should be large in size as some species were area sensitive and preferred patches .250-1600ha. Grassland patches should also have little to no woody edge. Finally, these patches should be located in close proximity to one another, or in areas of little fragmentation, to help increase the amount of grassland habitat in the landscape, as many of these grassland bird species were positively associated with the landscape variables, some up to 3200m.

AB  - Capitalizing on natural regeneration mechanisms is a realistic strategy for rehabilitating pastures within dry tropical ecosystems. The potential of natural regeneration to facilitate succession was assessed by observational and experimental research. Effects of cattle and grass removal and proximity to riparian forest were tested on quantified variables of natural regeneration, planted seedlings, and abiotic resources. Observational studies showed riparian zones as the greatest source of seed trees (μ = 45 stems, 19 species/.78 ha). Wind and animal-dispersed species were equally represented. Frugivory was the most common guild among captured bats (9/16 species, 73% of captures) and observed birds (22/34 species, 51% of captures). Several frugivorous bird and bat species moved between forested zones and open pastures, functioning as seed-dispersers within the pasture matrix. Rodents served as seedling predators, increasing the mortality rates of planted seedlings. Experimental studies demonstrated that recruited seedlings and sprouting initiates succession on lower slopes adjacent to forested riparian zones, which had the greatest stem densities (4.5 seedlings, 7 sprouts/32m 2 ) and species diversity (16 seedling species, 23 sprout species/384 m2 ). Tree seedlings were small-seeded (14 species; 95%/total count) with wind and animal dispersal equally represented. Herbicide is not recommended because recruited seedlings are susceptible to desiccation during the dry season. Herbicide also kills tree sprouts and shrubs, which can function as bird and bat attractants. Initially, cattle can be included in low densities to disperse large-seeded species. Isolated sites were unlikely to regenerate where seed sources were less numerous and less diverse (μ = 7.5 stems, 3.5 species per .78 ha). Natural regeneration was depauperate in terms of stem density (<2 seedlings, <4 tree sprouts per 32 m2 ) and species diversity (<5 seedling species, <11 sprout species per 384 m2 ). To accelerate forest succession, herbicide should be applied, cattle excluded, and seedlings planted. Planted seedlings had greater success in no cattle, herbicide treatments, with Cedrela odorata showing the lowest mortality and highest growing rates. Insect herbivory had a minor effect on seedling health. A forest rehabilitation conceptual model outlines natural regeneration potential and management techniques for accelerating succession in dry tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Increasing amounts and types of timely and accurate data are required for monitoring to ensure compliance with natural resource regulatory requirements. This study developed a cost-effective method to partially fulfill these data requirements using super large scale aerial photography (Scale: greater than 1:2,000). Two synchronized, metric, Rolleiflex 70mm (2.76in) cameras mounted 12m (40ft) apart on a rigid platform and carried at 5.6 km/hr (3 knots) by a helicopter collected this high resolution, 3D imagery from Alaska and Washington. The overlapping photo pairs provided 3D views of natural resource objects as fine as twigs. The 12m (40ft) inter-camera distance improved ground visibility between tree crowns of dense old growth forests. Analytical stereoplotters and the application of photogrammetric principles enabled measurement and interpretation of photo objects such as trees and their height in a cost-effective way. Horizontal and vertical measurement accuracy was within 2% and 3% of field measurement, respectively. Forest inventory and riparian buffer monitoring applications were used to test this method. Although field work is still required to develop photo-field relationships unique to each ecosystem and for quality assurance, the photo estimates of individual tree height, volume, diameter, type, and location, as well as down tree decay class and landing spot, plot timber volume, and area were comparable to and may replace approximately 95% of field effort. For example, the average of the absolute differences between field and photo estimates for tree height was 2.4m (7.8ft) (s.d. = 2.1m (6.8ft), n = 376), diameter at breast height (1.4m (4.5ft) above ground on uphill tree side) was 5.8cm (2.3in) (s.d. = 5.6cm (2.2in), n = 109), and plot volume in gross board feet was within 10.9% to 13.4% (n = 10) depending on the estimator used. Forest type was correctly classified 99.4% (n = 180) of the time. Timber inventory, species identification, sample distribution, down wood detection, and mapping of habitat features such as streams and trees provided improvement over field methods alone. For example, tree species was correctly identified 90% (n = 176) of the time for alder, Alaska cedar, lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and western redcedar. The spatial position of tree bases using digital elevation models was within 2.6m (8.4ft) of the actual position (s.d. = 1.4m (4.5ft), n = 20). Tree height, riparian buffer, and forest inventory plot volume data photo collection costs were one-fourth to one-half those of field methods. The new variables of tree crown closure and tree branch density were developed but did not contribute significantly to tree volume estimation. Physiographic limitations and sampling bias were eliminated by helicopter use.

AB  - The biological community, margin structure, and part soil quality indicators were investigated in 30 field margins and 10 patches of croplands in Quzhou Experimental district from May to October in 1996 and 1997. The research results were showed as follows. 259 carabids and 187 spiders were collected in 1996 and 1997. All of the carabids belong to 19 species, 7 genera. Harplus Latr. Is dominant genus; its number ranks first in carabid community. Other dominant species are H.simplicidents Schauberger H.griseus Panzer and H.tridens Mor. The rare species are Ch.uigulifer Chaudoir, Ch.micans Fab.,H.vicarius Harlod and Ch.serimicans Chaudoir. In 1996 monthly fluctuation of carabide individual numbers showed that the maximum carabides were collected in September and the minimum in July, In 1997 monthly fluctuation of carabids individual numbers increases gradually and reaches maximum in September. Monthly change of animal individual numbers in time seems to be related to its own biological characteristics, climate, agricultural practices. The investigation in Qianjiang county of Yantze river plain shows that 36 species, 13 genera Carabids were collected in 1996. The biological community in Qianjiang country was more abundant than that in Quzhou. Individual numbers and density of carabids and spider collected in different landscape and dynamics in time are different. The average of biodiversity index biological communities and carabids and spider individual numbers in field margins is more than those in fields, although those in croplands are more than those in margins sometimes, The average of monthly normal difference of carabides in field margins is lower than that in croplands, which indicates that change of monthly normal difference of carabides in field margins, is lower than that in croplands, which indicates that change of biological communities in field margins was more stable than those in cropland. It is concluded that animals always move between croplands and field margins, field Margins are animal's shelters and distribution area and play an important role in protection of natural enemy, such as carabids spider. Principal component and cluster analysis indicates that biodiversity in field margins is positive related to carabids individual numbers, its monthly normal difference, alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen and vegetable biodiversity; negative related to soil salinity; Carabids individual number was positive related to biological species, height of main vegetation and plant diversity, negative to soil salinity. Field margins were divided to six categories based on principal component analysis. There is some correlation between biodiversity and soil quality indicators in little disturbed field margins. Therefore, soil biological community and some characteristics can be used to evaluate soil quality. They can be probably used as soil quality indicator. But in human controlled farmland, some biological communities, which move fast and are heavily affected because of frequent farming practices,. Have little related to soil quality indicators so that they can't be used to evaluate soil quality.

AB  - The Kentucky Division of Water indicates that agriculture is responsible for 55% of the Commonwealth's assessed streams not supporting their designated uses. Riparian buffers reduce nonpoint source pollution in agroecosystems by storing and cycling nutrients, stabilizing streambanks, increasing infiltration, and storing water. Specific information regarding riparian buffer management is needed for land managers to maximize buffer effectiveness at reducing agricultural contaminants impairing water quality. Baseline soil properties (texture, pH, C and nutrients) of the riparian buffer surrounding a tributary of Cane Run Creek in Fayette County, KY were characterized prior to imposing three mowing regimes (intense, moderate, and no mow treatments) and one native grass regime. Measurements were made along parallel transects located 2-m and 8-m distances from the stream. Root biomass, aggregate distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured along the 2-m transect in two consecutive years following treatment establishment. The 2-m transect soils had the highest C, pH, Ca, Zn, and sand content. The 8-m transect had the highest P, K, Mg, and clay content. Semivariogram analysis of C content indicated slight to moderate spatial dependency along the 2m transect and moderate to strong spatial dependency along the 8m transect. Root biomass increased with decreased mowing frequency at the surface depth after one year; the native grass treatment had significantly less root biomass in both years compared to mowing treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on aggregate size distribution at the surface depth in either year. Mean weight diameter and large macroaggregates decreased from 2011 to 2012. Vegetation treatment had no statistically significant effect on water stable aggregates or saturated hydraulic conductivity. Experimental semivariograms provided evidence of spatial structure at multiple scales in root biomass, aggregates, and soil C. Spatial variability occurred over a shorter lag distance in 2012 than 2011, suggesting an effect of imposed treatments slowly developing over time.

AB  - Water use, photosynthetic gas exchange, and energy balance were studied in coffee (Coffea arabica L. cv. Yellow Catuai) hedgerows with leaf area index (LAI) from 0.7 to 7.5. The objectives were to: (1) estimate the irrigation requirements of coffee, (2) characterize the components of the energy balance at different LAI, (3) examine carbon isotope discrimination $(\Delta)$ an gas exchange as indices of performance, and (4) evaluate the contribution of environmental and physiological factors on the control of transpiration. Latent heat flux was the most important component of the energy balance, while sensible heat remained relatively constant and soil heat flux declined during canopy development. Concurrent canopy energy balance and branch sap flow measurements were used to partition total evapotranspiration (ET$\sb{\rm c})$ between crop and soil and interrow vegetation components. The transpiration component increased with LAI, comprising almost 100% of ET$\sb{\rm c}$ at LAI = 6.7. The crop coefficient (Kc), an estimate of relative water use, was 0.6 for fields with $LAI < 2$ and between 0.7 to 0.8 for fields with a $LAI > 2.$ $\Delta$ values of sun leaves indicated that intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE) increased with LAI, in contrast with a decrease suggested by measurements of instantaneous WUE. Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) decreased with LAI, suggesting a physiological compromise between intrinsic WUE and PNUE. Changes in $\Delta$ of mature leaves seemed to be the result of carbon turnover during leaf acclimation to the shade. Average stomatal, crown and boundary layer conductance remained relatively constant during canopy development. Average values of the decoupling coefficient $\Omega$ ranged between 0.7 and 0.8 at all values of LAI examined. Covariance of environmental factors during the day obscured stomatal responses to individual factors. Strong stomatal responses to light and air humidity, and wind speed were detected, particularly if the leaf surface was used as the reference point for estimation of external vapor pressure. Close correspondence of transpiration with net radiation and stability of leaf temperature indicated that stomata played a major role in restricting canopy temperature to a range favorable for physiological activity.

AB  - An alley cropping system was established in Madison County, Georgia, on a kaolinitic Kandiudult soil. The climate is subhumid and agricultural production is hampered by acidity, low base saturation, and high P fixation. In 1991-92, hedgerows were planted with mimosa (Albizia julibrissin), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), and princess tree (Paulownia tomentosa) and separated by 4 m-wide alleys. Alleys were cropped with a grain sorghum-winter wheat rotation. Soils were analyzed periodically for concentrations of K, Mg, Ca, N, and P. In 1992-93, the pigeonpea was moved from the hedgerows and interplanted with sorghum in the alleys. Treatment effects were compared between alleys, conventionally-tilled but unfertilized plots, and conventionally-tilled and fertilized plots. In-row sorghum yields were not statistically different between alley cropped and unfertilized plots in either 1991 or 1992; fertilized plots yielded significantly more sorghum than alley or unfertilized plots in 1992. Yields in 1992 declined significantly from 1991 yields. Alley cropped wheat significantly out-yielded unfertilized wheat in 1992 and 1993 and was as productive as the fertilized plots in 1993. Hedgerows did not provide a substantial amount of N as prunings but increasing the density of N-fixing hedgerow trees would increase this contribution. Potentially mineralizable nitrogen increased significantly for two months following the distribution of hedgerow residues on the surface of the alley cropped plots. A P-fractionation procedure was followed to determine the concentration of the various forms of soil P. The supply of labile P was found to cycle from relatively abundant after the sorgnum crop to significantly lower concentrations after the wheat crop. Three possible explanations for this phenomenon are offered. Litter bags containing mimosa, pigeonpea, and combined mimosa and pigeonpea residues were placed on the soil surface in alley cropped plots and collected periodically over a 6-month period. Lignin, polyphenol, and C and N contents were determined for each sample. A computer model was used to test the influence of air temperature and precipitation on rates of decomposition. Lignin was the most important chemical component limiting decomposition, but precipitation and temperature were also highly correlated to decomposition rates.

AB  - Imported fire ants are invasive and cause injury to people, crops, livestock and wildlife. Disturbance may increase abundance and activity of fire ants. However, native grass field buffers established for grassland birds require periodic disturbance. I experimentally tested if fire ant mound density and foraging activity changed after burning and disking in native grass buffers and examined relationships among fire ants, vegetation, and grassland bird and butterfly metrics in undisturbed buffers. In 2008, disking increased mound density and foraging activity, but burning did not. In 2009, disking had no effect, but effects of disking the previous season persisted. Fire ant metrics were not related generally to bird or butterfly metrics. Mound density and foraging activity were related negatively to grass cover and related positively to forbs. Burning had less influence on abundance and activity of fire ants, and may better conserve grassland habitats in areas with fire ants.

AB  - The physical parameters of past experimental riparian buffer studies were used to develop a riparian buffer classification framework (RBCF) that uses high resolution remotely sensed data to identify the physical parameters of a riparian buffer and assign an estimate of total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiency. Topographic data with a contour interval of 2 feet, color digital orthophotography with 1-foot resolution, and hydrography data covering a 1.8 square mile study area located within the city limits of Raleigh, North Carolina were utilized to test the RBCF. A cartographic model was developed to prepare each data layer for analysis. Applying the RBCF within the framework of the cartographic model produced highly detailed maps of existing riparian areas, and also provided an estimate of a riparian buffer's efficiency in removing TSS from stormwater runoff. In this study, riparian buffers are identified through remote sensing at spatial scales of sufficient detail to determine regulated widths and also to examine the separate management zones within a buffer. Automated processing techniques for remotely sensed data, used in combination with specific resource classification schemes such as he RBCF will enable the assessment and analysis of site-specific conditions at county-wide scales.

AB  - Non-point source pollution in agricultural regions in the Midwest consists of two important components, namely, dislodgement of common pollutants, their movement across the landscape and subsequently transport through surface waters to their final destination. The objectives of this study were to: (1) model surface movement of agricultural pollutants for a succession of sub-watersheds in Bear Creek using AGNPS; (2) calibrate and validate the model for a small sub-watershed using available experimental plot data; (3) incorporate Monte Carlo simulation within the modeling process where field data was not available; (4) apply the calibrated and validated model to a small sub-watershed with a riparian buffer strip to observe mitigating effects on surface pollutants if any; (5) formulate a Markov random field model for use in modeling nitrate-nitrogen concentrations for a network of monitoring stations on the Des Moines River; (6) estimate, fit, and cross-validate the model and; (7) apply the model to dissolved oxygen and suspended solids to evaluate the model's specificity for each water quality variable. The agricultural non-point source pollution model (AGNPS) was used to model surface transport processes at the watershed level. Modifications were made to the existing AGNPS-ARC/INFO interface in order to automate feedlot, point source, and channel information. The model was calibrated for total runoff (inches), sediment yield (tons), soluble nitrate-nitrogen in runoff (lbs/acre), soluble nitrate- nitrogen concentration in runoff (ppm), phosphorus in sediment (lbs/acre), soluble phosphorus in runoff (lbs/acre) and soluble phosphorus concentration in runoff (ppm) to be found at the outlet of each watershed. The model was then applied to a small watershed to demonstrate the effect of riparian buffer strips in mitigating surface pollution in an agricultural field. From graphical displays it was clear that the model predicted better under drier conditions than for excessively wet conditions. Corn consistently gave lower RMSE for all seven parameters calibrated compared to either the combination of rowcrop and switchgrass or row crop, switchgrass. shrubs and trees. The buffer strip in general seemed to have a mitigating effect on the pollutants as they moved over the surface. Switchgrass seemed to be highly effective in reducing the movement of pollutants into the stream. Runoff volume was reduced by 19%, soluble nitrogen concentrations were reduced by 3%, soluble phosphorus concentrations were reduced by 3% for the early summer precipitation event. Smaller watersheds in the headwaters were the highest contributors of pollutants to the stream. For the second part of the research a statistical model was developed for modeling nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the Des Moines River. A space-time metric was developed to represent spatial dependence in the "variable distance" model versus a purely spatial metric in the "fixed distance" model. An independent model was also fit, which only included systematic trend, in order to make comparisons between models. The "variable distance" or flow model performed better due to the ability to model greater variability in the system. When applied to dissolved oxygen and suspended solids, the model did not perform as well. This indicated that the model was specific to nitrate-nitrogen which transported differently than dissolved oxygen or suspended solids. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Throughout human history, humans have altered the environment upon which they continue to depend. Rapid expansion of urban and agricultural areas, which has occurred with the expense of natural areas, has degraded water resources with excessive nutrients and suspended sediment loadings. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that specific current land use configurations have a strong influence upon water quality in the Han River Basin, Korea. Following the examination of the hypothesis, the study analyzes the preservation of riparian vegetated area as an alternative management practice to improve water quality at the water-land interface. Riparian vegetation and soils are examined as a nutrient and sediment filters. This study also compares current riparian management measures in the U.S.A. and Korea, because special problems with implementing a program of riparian buffer strip mitigation were anticipated in Korea. This task was undertaken to determine culturally and politically appropriate riparian management measures for Korea. Major findings of this study are: (1) among various land uses, urban land uses are the most strongly related to water pollution of the Han River, Korea; (2) existence of riparian forest is negatively related with all pollutant concentrations except the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in agricultural areas; (3) the preservation of riparian forests can be a considered possible alternative to reduce water pollution of the Han River; (4) finally, in addition to existing management measures, the preservation of riparian areas by voluntary approaches, using subsidy and incentives, can be successfully adopted from US experience by Korea with some legal and political adjustments.

AB  - Reliance on agricultural chemicals as the primary method of pest control is not a practical long-term pest management strategy, especially for low-resource farmers in developing countries like Haiti where poverty, illiteracy, and limited access to training compound the risks associated with pesticide use. Conservation biological control is an ecologically-based pest management strategy that seeks to increase existing beneficial arthropods and enhance their regulatory activity by making the agricultural landscape more favorable for their establishment and survival. In this study, the impact of vegetational diversity on the abundance of pest and natural enemy populations was studied in vegetable production systems in Florida, and central Haiti. Non-crop vegetation including weeds and refuge strips was incorporated into squash ( Cucurbita pepo L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and mixed cropping systems. Additionally, the pest management practices of farmers living in rural Haiti were investigated using the Sondeo method. In Florida, pest and natural enemy abundance, weed richness and biomass, and yields were compared in pepper in Florida with different weed densities using multiple sampling techniques. Beneficial insects were generally found in greater numbers in the unweeded treatment than in weed-free plots. Greater numbers of arthropod taxa correlated with increased weed richness. However, leaving weeds within the plot did not result in increased biological control and negatively affected pepper yields. A similar experiment conducted in Haiti compared the influence of weed density and locally available mulches on the invertebrate community. The use of sugarcane ( Saccharum sp.) bagasse mulch was more useful than maintaining a weed refuge for increasing numbers of beneficial arthropods in the soil surface community and reduced the labor associated with weeding. The impact of intercropping non-crop vegetation on the above-ground arthropod community was assessed in squash. Natural enemies were most abundant in the native weed complex and pigeon pea borders; however, there was only limited spillover of natural enemies into the adjacent squash crop. Intercropped strips did not influence the movement of thrips and whiteflies into the plots. None of the border intercrop treatments prevented a heavy infestation of melonworm ( Diaphania hyalinata L.). Conversational interviews conducted during a participatory rural appraisal in north central Haiti revealed that agrochemicals ranging from moderately to highly toxic are available to rural Haitian farmers in the study area without label and safety information. Currently, pesticides are only used for seed conservation and in high-value vegetable production. Farmers in the study area have received little training in pest management and none of the farmers interviewed were aware of beneficial insects. Integrated pest management (IPM) training would be highly beneficial to farmers in this community. Successful training is likely to take place within existing community groups and among future farmer groups. A survey of selected invertebrate groups associated with different soil conservation barriers in central Haiti was conducted during fall 2009. Pitfall traps were used to characterize the invertebrate communities within contour hedgerows and non-living erosion barriers in both successional and mixed cropping systems. Collembola, ants, and spiders were most closely associated with the barrier habitat regardless of the type of border or cropping system. Local farmers that participated in the survey expressed interest in the ecosystem services provided by natural enemies and fauna involved in decomposition and nutrient cycling.

AB  - On the boreal forest landscape, inherent edges are already prominent features and edges created by timber harvesting are also becoming common. Both types of edges border unharvested buffer zones left around lakes following harvest. I investigated forest structure and composition along edge-to-interior gradients from lakeshore and clearcut edges, and within buffer strips of different width. I had three objectives: (1) To quantify trends in forest structure and composition and to determine distance of edge influence for different response variables for both lakeshore and clearcut forest edges; (2) To assess edge influence on forest structure and composition at edges of different aged cutblocks; (3) To model edge influence and to predict the width of interior forest in buffers of different widths. Trees, coarse woody material, saplings, shrubs and herbs were sampled at different distances from lakeshore edges and created edges adjacent to 1, 2, 5, and 16 yr old cutblocks, within buffer zones of three different widths (25, 100, 200m), and in interior forest. I developed a new method for quantifying distance of edge influence by comparing averages of response variables at different distances from the edge to critical values determined by randomization tests of data collected in interior forest. There was a structurally diverse 40m wide lakeshore forest edge community with greater amounts of coarse woody material, and more saplings and mid canopy trees than in interior forest. Following harvest, clearcut edges experienced damage to five trees and snags, increasing the amount of coarse woody material. Prolific suckering of Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera was accompanied by a decrease in total shrub cover, and changes in understory composition. Overall, distance of edge influence from clearcut edges extended about 20m into the forest, and this did not differ substantially among edges at different aged cutblocks. Edge influence in narrow buffers is predicted to be greater for combined edge influence from lakeshore and clearcut edges, and less if the riparian forest is resistant to edge influence. The 200m buffers are the only ones predicted (of the three studied (25, 100, 200m)) to have substantial interior forest habitat over time.

AB  - A 2-year study in East Texas evaluated Short's (1986) Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) for white-tailed deer. This study focused on Model III which requires estimates of available winter forage and implies only general habitat information. Forage availability in 3-4 (YP), 5-9 (IP),and 11-15 (OP) year old pine plantations and associated riparian zones (RZs) was sampled. HSI values for each stand type were determined and correlated to telemetrically obtained deer locations. There were significant differences in forage availability between stand types and years; the YP stand type provided the most forage and thus had the highest HSI values. The IP, RZ, and OP types ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively. HSI values were poorly correlated with deer locations primarily because the model considered only forage availability, and radio locations did not consider types of animal activity. The primary advantage of Short's models was the simplicity and ease of application. Disadvantages included unreliable indications of habitat quality, unclear model specifications, and unrealistic representation of animal needs. Model improvements would include specific collection methods involving food preferences, sample size statements, and modification of graphs to accommodate wet weights of vegetation.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones are defined as strips of natural vegetation separating streams or lakes from surrounding upland landscapes. These zones may effectively reduce the nitrate-N load in shallow ground water draining intensively fertilized agricultural regions. Contemporary research has tended to focus on wide, forested riparian zones situated on poorly drained lowland sites. In addition, research has typically focused on the growing season, when the ecosystem is biologically active, with relatively dry hydrological conditions. This field study monitored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate-N in a comparatively narrow, non-forested buffer zone situated in an upland agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Results show that the nitrate attenuation ability of the buffer zone is spatially and temporally variable. At one site, the buffer zone consistently reduced concentrations of nitrate from input values greater than 10 mg/l, to less than 1 mg/l. At another site, located only 200 m up stream, the reduction of nitrate concentrations was much less. However, the rate of nitrate attenuation in terms of mass was similar at both sites. Temporal variations were observed in the nitrate attenuation ability of both sites. While the ratio of nitrate removed to nitrate input decreased during the dormant season, the actual mass removed increased. Differences in hydrogeological structure and land use associated with the two sites are likely responsible for the different attenuation patterns.

AB  - Field margins were sown with a range of indigenous British wild flower species and managed using a variety of management techniques including the application of selective herbicides during the plant establishment phase. Densities of overwintering polyphagous arthropods and their potential prey were measured in a wild flower margin site during two winters. Numbers of polyphagous predators were found to be influenced by plant diversity, margin management (especially mowing) and numbers of potential prey species present. A higher number of key predatory invertebrates were present in some wild flower-drilled margins than in undrilled control margins. Floral resources were foraged upon by a variety of hoverfly species during the summer months, many of which have aphidophagous larvae. Wild flower drilled field margins were shown to attract greater numbers of some hoverfly species and also have a significant impact on the distribution of adults within the adjacent field. No significant differences in the numbers of syrphid larvae or aphids were found between fields with or without wild flower-drilled field margins. A survey of hoverfly foraging preference was used to assess the importance of individual wild flower species to foraging aphidophagous and non-aphidophagous hoverflies. Syrphids foraged selectively on wild flowers and preferences differed between sites and between dates. The potential role of field margins in enhancing the level of biological control by naturally occurring predators on arable land is discussed.

AB  - Using Negeri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia as a case study, this dissertation focuses on the following issues: the relationships between human land use and secondary forest creation, the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance via land use on the recovery of secondary forests, and the benefits that these forests provide to humans. The introduction presents a review of the state of knowledge on the ecology and uses of tropical secondary forests. In the next two chapters, the findings from ecological field studies on secondary forests are presented: First, the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on these forests are revealed using plot surveys to assess the vegetation characteristics of riparian forest strips and 18-year-old abandoned paddy fields. It is shown that the former paddy fields and the riparian forest strips do not show high similarity with undisturbed floodplain forests in the vegetation's structural and compositional characteristics. Also, species similarity between the abandoned paddy fields and the riparian forest strips is moderately low (CS = 0.47). Vegetation characteristics of the former paddy fields and riparian forest strips have also been influenced by non-native species, constituting 23 % of the total identified species. Second, there follows an account of experimental work on the growth variable responses of tree seedlings to elevated levels of important nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). It is found that Glochidion obscurum and Lagerstroemia speciosa respond positively to combined NPK but not to single P additions, whereas Vitex pinnata does not show any responses. The findings are discussed in the context of current agricultural practices in the study area whereby high fertilizer input is commonly used to achieve high crop yields. It is suggested that these land use practices can potentially produce adverse growing conditions for the non-responsive V. pinnata but not for G. obscurum and L. speciosa, at least not for the near future. Next, the dissertation changes focus to investigate the uses of secondary forests by rural households and the sales of forest products in rural towns. From Household surveys, it is found that overall the use level of forest products, based on a sample of nine plant-derived forest products, is low. From Market surveys, it is found that the 'alternative markets' provide an avenue for the rural as well as the town populations to buy several types of forest products. The conclusion brings together the findings of previous chapters, and provides a short discussion on how these findings can be used for better management of secondary forests especially in Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Eutrophication of surface waters remains a worldwide and rising environmental problem despite more the 40 years of research and implementation of mitigation and management strategies. Agricultural nonpoint phosphorus (P) has been recognized as the main cause of impairment of fresh waters in the USA. Questions persist about the potential of natural subsurface pathways to export P from agricultural ecosystems to surface waters in the Midwestern region of the US. The capacity of vegetative riparian buffers to limit P transport in this pathway is also uncertain. A comprehensive understanding of the parameters and mechanisms controlling subsurface P losses from cultivated lands to adjacent water bodies also remains to be achieved. In order to address these questions, forms and concentrations of soil solution P were characterized at 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.5 and 2.5m depths within of a corn-soybean rotation field, across two riparian buffers and in tile and ditch drainage flows. Field surface and subsurface hydrology and riparian vegetation biomass were also characterized in order to establish a P mass balance. Results suggest that the main mechanisms controlling seasonal patterns of total, total reactive and total unreactive P concentrations in the upper soil profile were freeze-thaw cycles and enhanced mineralization in winter, P fertilizer inputs, large P leaching and elevated biological activity in spring, dry-wet cycles in summer, and P leaching combined with reduced soil P buffering capacity in fall. Mean water table P concentrations remained constant across seasons in the cultivated field indicating that seasonal P losses were mainly controlled by subsurface water discharge. Amount and form of subsurface P export were influenced by enriched top-soils, pathway of infiltration and field pattern of surface runoff. They occurred at concentrations above the minimum level able to accelerate eutrophication of fresh waters. The two riparian buffers were able to significantly reduce subsurface P transport and the proportions of P lost in the reactive most-bioavailable form. Phosphorus removal by the riparian vegetation was larger than potential P loads from the agricultural field. Management of the two vegetated riparian zones could ensure their long-term efficiency to diminish P loads to surface waters.

AB  - Grassy arable field margins provide important permanent habitats for arthropods in agro-ecosystems and due to their proximity to high input areas, are exposed to pesticide drift. The aims of this thesis are to determine the likely effects of glyphosate drift in arable field margins by examining patterns of a medium quality spray drift intercepted by plant species in buffer strips and the effects of glyphosate on non-target field margin arthropods. Levels of medium-quality spray drift, analogous to herbicide drift, intercepted by field margin plant species in field boundaries were significantly reduced by inclusions of 2m and 6m wide buffer strips. Levels of spray drift interception varied between plant species and were related to plant height and leaf area. Dose-response testing of glyphosate against field margin plant species was done to establish inherent susceptibilities to the herbicide. Many species appeared to be unaffected by high levels of glyphosate (1800g ha -1 ), while others had relatively high ED50 s that were unlikely to be exceeded by UK recommended rates of glyphosate. It was noted that lack of exposure to interspecific competition may have enhanced the plant species tolerance to high levels of glyphosate. Different rates of glyphosate were screened against the non-target arthropods Lepthyphantes tenuis (Araneae) and Leptopterna dolabrata (Heteroptera) to assess toxicity. Glyphosate was found to be non-toxic, however, applications of glyphosate to food plants increased mortality in L. dolabrata . In a field experiment, glyphosate applications of more than 360g ha-1 to a grassy arable field margin reduced Araneae, Heteroptera and Carabidae abundance. Community analyses (DCA) indicated that communities in the field margins exposed to more than 360g ha-1 glyphosate were distinct from unsprayed field margins. It is predicted that drift of field applied glyphosate at rates greater than 1440g ha-1 would reduce phytophagous Heteroptera and Gonatium rubens (Araneae) abundance.

AB  - Riparian management in the Pacific Northwest has become an increasingly common way to conserve biodiversity on landscapes managed for timber production. The efficacy of two different riparian buffer widths in providing habitat for terrestrial amphibians was assessed using a Before-After-Control-Impact approach. My findings suggest that there is no global response by terrestrial amphibians to logging or to the retention of riparian management zones in the US Pacific Northwest. Rather, species showed individual responses that varied over time and between treatments and transects. Overall, a minimum riparian buffer width of 30 m was sufficient to maintain the relative abundance and richness of terrestrial amphibians at levels commensurate with pre-harvest conditions. A co-inertia analysis revealed that habitat associations changed little over time and that there were no significant differences between buffered sites suggesting that the treatments applied were biologically insignificant. The benefits of retaining riparian forest are identified and discussed in the context of maintaining biodiversity and conserving terrestrial amphibians in western Washington.

AB  - Recent studies of agricultural watersheds have indicated that vegetated filter zones (VFZ) may not function optimally because of channelized surface runoff through the zone. One promising solution has been to disperse channelized surface runoff in the receiving portion of the filter zone (FZ) with level spreaders. However, widespread adoption of level spreaders as a best management practice requires designs that are both functional and cost effective over a range of site characteristics including FZ condition and with varying sources of nonpoint-source pollution and under differing rates of loading. The main objective of this research was to evaluate different level spreader designs and configurations for dispersing channelized agricultural runoff and to evaluate them for enhancing FZ effectiveness on several sites with greatly differing watershed characteristics. Other objectives included estimating construction and maintenance costs and developing recommendations for level spreaders for specific watershed and FZ conditions. Level spreaders with associated instrumentation were constructed on eight watersheds from 1989 to 1997 representing a wide variety of watershed and FZ conditions. Spreaders without associated instrumentation were constructed on three watersheds. Source areas included crops under both conventional and conservation tillage, a pasture, a dry-lot for dairy cattle, and a paved and partly-roofed cattle containment area. Designs tested included commercial galvanized gutters, treated wood, fabric-lined ditches with gravel just above and below the ditch, and vegetated berm and trench. Reductions in NPSP through-puts were a function of filter zone size, input concentration, runoff volume, and season. Filter zones where FZ area was greater than two percent of source-area size generally removed a least a third of each analyte. Of the six sites with dispersed flow which did not have large unaccounted contributions to the FZ, only one failed to reduce N by 30 percent. All spreader designs improved FZ performance. Level spreaders with larger cross-sectional areas were more effective for high peak-flow events. The most easily maintained design is a vegetated berm and trench spreader shaped from soil. This design also allows limited vehicle traffic over the spreader.

AB  - Coexisting congeneric species often are segregated ecologically via resource partitioning. Sympatric sibling species provide the ideal situation for investigating resource partitioning and mechanisms of coexistence because of their recent common ancestry and great phenotypic similarity. Avian sibling species, such as Alder Flycatchers ( Empidonax alnorum ) and Willow Flycatchers (E. traillii ), are often segregated into distinctive climate-vegetation zones, and are thus essentially allopatric during the breeding season. However, secondary contact occurs where preferred habitats abut, providing opportunities to study coexistence between recently-diverged species. I quantified habitat use by Alder and Willow flycatchers in areas of local allopatry and local sympatry in a region of secondary contact in southwestern Alberta. I measured numerous variables pertaining to horizontal and vertical components of vegetation structure and ground cover at three spatial scales on territories of each species. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, I tested for differences in habitat use between the species within site types, and compared habitat use by each species between sites of local sympatry and local allopatry to test for possible effects of coexistence. I found numerous differences in habitat use between territories of each species in local allopatry across all three spatial scales. They differed in the amount of water cover and the structure and composition of vegetation on their territories. Alder Flycatcher territories were located in dry areas and contained very tall, partially-dead bushes. Willow Flycatcher territories were located in low-lying areas that always contained still or moving water, saturated soil and mossy ground cover and low, wide, dense bushes. Local coexistence of Alder and Willow flycatchers occurred only where environmental conditions produced a mosaic of habitats at the boundary of their respective ranges. When in local sympatry, the species vigorously defended interspecific territories. Although fewer significant differences in habitat use were detected than in allopatry, they remained microspatially segregated along the hydrological gradient at the sympatric sites. Therefore, differential habitat use is probably the key factor in the ecological segregation of the species in areas of secondary contact. Comparisons of habitat use between areas of local allopatry and areas of local sympatry revealed non-experimental evidence for an asymmetrical competitive relationship. Alder Flycatchers showed numerous differences in habitat use between the two site types at all scales of measurement, whereas Willow Flycatchers showed very little change in their habitat use whether in the presence of absence of their sibling species. The observed shift in habitat use by Alder Flycatchers in local sympatry may be the result of competitive displacement. In the contact zone in eastern North America, Willow Flycatchers use dry, upland thickets and meadows and Alder Flycatchers use boggy to wet alder. My study suggests that the pattern of habitat use by the two species in their western range may be opposite to that shown by eastern populations. This is an unusual ecological and evolutionary phenomenon and is the first documentation of regional reversal of habitat use by sympatric species.

AB  - Increased nutrient loads have resulted in several adverse impacts on surface water quality, including excessive algal growth, fish kills, and drinking water taste and odor issues across the United States and especially in the Ozark ecoregion of northeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas. Nitrogen is a concern, but phosphorus (P) is generally considered the limiting nutrient in most surface water systems. Scientists and engineers need to identify critical nutrient source areas and transport mechanisms within a catchment in order to cost effectively protect and enhance drinking water systems, recreation activities, and aquatic ecosystems. While surface runoff is considered to be the primary transport mechanism for P, leaching through the vadose zone and subsurface transport through coarse gravel subsoils to gravel bed streams may be significant and represents a source of P not alleviated by current conservation practices (e.g., riparian buffers). Therefore, the overarching objective of this research was to characterize subsurface phosphorus transport in the coarse gravel floodplains of the Ozark ecoregion. An injection test was performed which showed preferential flow paths and physical non-equilibrium in the coarse gravel vadose and phreatic zones. Preferential flow paths were interpreted to be buried gravel bars. Long-term flow and transport monitoring was performed at two floodplain sites, showing aquifer heterogeneity and large scale bank storage of stream water, as well as large scale, stage-dependent transient storage of P in the alluvial aquifer. Subsurface P transport rates in the alluvial aquifers were quantified and found to be significant compared to surface runoff P transport rates on well managed pastures. In order to quantify P leaching through the vadose zone, a berm method was developed and utilized for plot-scale infiltration experiments. The surface soil type (ranging from silt loam to clean gravel) and macroporosity were found to have a significant impact on P leaching capacity. This research highlighted the difference between the conceptual model of uniform piston infiltration and actual infiltration in field conditions. Since floodplains are well-connected to alluvial aquifers and streams in gravelly watersheds, a higher level of agricultural stewardship may be required for floodplains than upland areas. This has implications for the development of best management practices specifically for floodplains in the Ozark ecoregion due to their close proximately and connectedness to streams.

AB  - Changing weather patterns, the declining social fabric of rural communities, and economic uncertainty increasingly pose challenges to Vermont communities. The socially and environmentally embedded production practices within sustainable agriculture present a potential solution to these problems. In order to make the most of the potential benefits of these practices society must maximize their adoption. This requires an understanding of both farmer adoption of these practices and consumer perceptions of the resulting food products. This thesis contributes two original articles on sustainable agriculture through the analysis of factors driving both farmer adoption and consumer perceptions of products and practices often thought of as sustainable. The first article seeks to understand farmer adoption of climate change best management practices (CCBMPs). Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices (BMPs) are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure appropriate price points are offered through these programs, regional price structures must be based upon locally established costs. Thus, this article focuses on the economic cost of implementing and maintaining CCBMPs for twelve diverse farms in Vermont. Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results of a yearlong farmer based data collection process indicate that the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, for MIRG is $79.82/acre, and for a tree based riparian buffer strip is $807.33/acre. We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption. The second article reports on a study which seeks to understand the factors influencing Vermont consumer perceptions of raw milk safety. While this article makes no assertion regarding the sustainability of raw milk, an association is established between the motivations for raw milk consumption and sustainable agriculture support. Vermonter's appear to be continuing the trend of consuming raw milk at an increasing rate despite continued declarations from local and national public health officials that raw milk is too microbiologically dangerous to justify its consumption. Thus this study was designed to increase understanding of the factors driving consumer perceptions of raw milk safety. A conceptual model was developed to establish potential factors and related questions were incorporated into the 2014 Vermonter Poll. Resulting data were analyzed using a Probit regression analysis. We conclude that observable factors have the greatest influence on perceptions of raw milk safety. Specifically, perceived health benefits, presence of children in the household, and taste all influence perceptions of raw milk safety.

We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption. The second article reports on a study which seeks to understand the factors influencing Vermont consumer perceptions of raw milk safety. While this article makes no assertion regarding the sustainability of raw milk, an association is established between the motivations for raw milk consumption and sustainable agriculture support. Vermonter's appear to be continuing the trend of consuming raw milk at an increasing rate despite continued declarations from local and national public health officials that raw milk is too microbiologically dangerous to justify its consumption. Thus this study was designed to increase understanding of the factors driving consumer perceptions of raw milk safety. A conceptual model was developed to establish potential factors and related questions were incorporated into the 2014 Vermonter Poll. Resulting data were analyzed using a Probit regression analysis. We conclude that observable factors have the greatest influence on perceptions of raw milk safety. Specifically, perceived health benefits, presence of children in the household, and taste all influence perceptions of raw milk safety.

AB  - Denitrification, nitrogen fixation, methanogenesis and carbon dioxide evolution were measured in bottomland soils in a 1560-hectare agricultural watershed. In Georgia's upper coastal plain, excess fertilizer and animal wastes move in subsurface flow from upland zones into lowland forests, where microbial uptake and processing occur. Highest rates of denitrification, at 295 kg N ha('-1)yr('-1), were measured in a forest immediately downslope from a hog pen. Two sites with forests adjacent to crop fields showed spring denitrification maxima, with yearly estimates of 36 and 23 kg N ha('-1)yr('-1). Rates of denitrification were consistently low or absent at a "control" site which was buffered from agricultural inputs by a 120-m uncultivated strip; the annual estimate for this site was about 1 kg N ha('-1)yr('-1). Denitrification was inhibited at both low and excessively high soil water contents. No effect of nitrate on denitrification was found, but ammonium had a positive effect, strongest (r = .715, p = .0001) at a site with an upland crop field. Upland field drainage reduced nitrogen inputs into lowland forests and limited denitrification rates, although loss of nitrogen from organic matter partly offset this effect. Denitrification was significantly correlated with CO(,2) production, measured by alkali absorption, at all sites. Production of N(,2)O during the winter months was compared in cores incubated with and without acetylene. Significant differences were found only at the hog pen site, where N(,2)O evolution rates were 62 and 28 kg N ha('-1)yr('-1) with and without acetylene, respectively. N(,2)O evolution due to nitrification was demonstrated by nitrapyrin inhibition at this site. At other sites, similarities both in rates and spatial patterns of N(,2)O emissions with and without acetylene suggested that N(,2)O was a terminal denitrification product. A coupled nitrification-denitrification process was probably required to maintain denitrification rates due to low ambient nitrate concentrations. Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation was low relative to denitrification except at the control site, ranging from 0.60 to 2.33 kg N ha('-1)yr('-1). Inhibition by low concentrations of nitrate was demonstrated by correlation analysis. Fixation rates were high in zones of high methane flux. Methanogenesis was highest at the hog pen site (125 kg ha('-1)yr('-1)) and at crop field sites during the spring. Timing of methane flux and a strong correlation with soil ammonium concentrations suggested that agricultural nutrient inputs were stimulatory. Depth profiles suggested that methane oxidation occurred at the surface. At the hog pen site, active methanogenesis occurred beneath or downslope of denitrifying zones. Soil CO(,2) evolution showed an "edge effect" at the forest/field interface; rates decreased as much as 100% moving downslope into the wetter forest zones, and reductions occurred also in adjacent fields. Gradients in soil moisture and organic matter were opposite to CO(,2) evolution, suggesting that organic matter accumulates and/or export of organic compounds to the streams occurs in bottomland areas.

AB  - In spite of increasingly stringent water policy and years of stream ecology research, urban and agricultural land uses continue to degrade stream ecosystems across the United States. This is due in part to incomplete scientific understanding of land use impacts on streams. I quantified relationships among land use, in-stream environmental metrics, and invertebrate metrics in streams of central Iowa to provide insight into differential impacts of agriculture and urbanization on stream condition, and to identify potential mechanisms of land use effects on stream condition. Results suggest that even moderate levels of urban land use can have greater adverse effects on headwater stream ecosystems than intensive agriculture. However, even in highly degraded streams, invertebrate assemblages and related ecosystem functions likely benefit from practices that maintain or increase abundance of coarse substrate, particulate organic matter, and plants. In urban areas, continuing degradation of stream ecosystems also results from difficulty in fully integrating human and non-human factors into research of stream ecosystems, and from inadequate knowledge of effectiveness of stream restoration practices. We addressed these challenges in a project that integrated public participation, urban stream restoration, and ecological research. We facilitated mutual learning through public participation in the design and implementation of an urban riparian buffer, a process that was informed by ecological research. Evaluations of learning revealed that participants' knowledge about urban water quality issues and stormwater management practices increased, and their perceptions about the importance of stream ecosystem functions changed. Infiltration tests and in-stream monitoring provided early evidence of buffer effectiveness in absorption of runoff and pollutants from surrounding surfaces. Elements essential to the success of this project included an opportunity for dialog focused on a specific natural feature, sustained interaction between participants and researchers, opportunities for hands-on participation, and flexibility in restoration practice installation. Integrated research and restoration projects like this one can overcome many of the obstacles that hinder efforts to reduce human impacts on streams.

AB  - The manipulation of beneficial insects can be done through purposeful releases of biological control organisms, or through manipulation of non-crop habitat. Both mechanisms are explored in various agroecosystems. In chapter 2, I determine if the parasitoid wasp Binodoxys communis , imported from China, is able to colonize, and suppress soybean aphid, Aphis glycines in Iowa soybean fields. In addition, the effects of initial soybean aphid densities are measured. Binodoxys communis successfully colonized soybean aphids in Iowa soybean fields, but is not always effective at suppressing soybean aphid populations. Abiotic and biotic factors were more important for the suppression of soybean aphid. In addition, Binodoxys communis acts in a density-dependent manner when soybean aphid populations are lower. Thus, augmentative releases when soybean aphid populations are lower may limit soybean aphid populations. In chapter 3, I examined conservation of natural enemies (and other arthropod guilds) as part of a larger interdisciplinary study. Prairie vegetative strips were planted in various treatment amounts (0% to 20%), and distributions (0 to 3 strips) within watershed catchments devoted to annual crop production. Arthropods were significantly more abundant within prairie land cover than crop, but the various treatments had no effect on arthropod abundance. When examining the most commonly collected natural enemy taxa, we find that most taxa are more abundant within prairie over the entire season. At different sampling dates throughout the season, these natural enemy taxa responded in varying ways to the availability of alternative prey and resources available within prairie land cover. Within this system, prairie integration had a significant impact on the abundance and diversity of arthropods; however the surrounding matrix of each site was dominated by prairie, and likely silenced the treatment effects.

AB  - This project examines the effect of providing boundary strips of Phacelia tanacetifolia (Hydrophyllaceae) beside cereal fields to attract adult hoverflies, on biological control of aphids in the adjacent crops in the adjacent crop by hoverfly larvae. Phacelia, a North American annual species that is a good source of pollen for adult hoverflies, was drilled in the margins of three winter wheat fields in 1992 and in different fields in 1993. Numbers of hoverflies caught in yellow water traps, oviposition rates and aphid densities in these fields were compared with those in control fields. In 1992 in the fields bordered with Phacelia more hoverflies were captured in the traps but neither the amount of oviposition, nor aphid numbers, differed significantly between treatments. This may have been because the wheat matured early so that it was less suitable for syrphid oviposition when gravid females were in the field. In 1993, numbers of adults caught in experimental and control fields were not significantly different. However, significantly more eggs were found in fields with Phacelia borders than in control fields and fewer aphids were present in these fields than in controls during the 4th week of the experiment when many third instar syrphid larvae were found in the crop. The results of a supplementary experiment comprising yellow water trap catches of hoverflies at crop height and at ground level indicated that the crop high traps were selectively attracting newly emerged and hungry individuals.An investigation into the feeding preferences of the most common aphidophagous syrphid species in New Zealand revealed that anemophilous pollen was an important component of its diet, but that Phacelia pollen was also eaten by this species.The extent to which this work has clarified the relationship between flowers and oviposition by hoverflies is discussed along with ideas for continued work in this field.

AB  - The stalk borer (SB), Papaipema nebris Gn. exhibited from 7 to 9 instars when reared on a meridic diet in a controlled environment. Both sexes went through variable numbers of instars before pupation. Head capsule width measurements did not form discrete sets, and overlap occurred between adjacent instars. In feeding preference tests with first instar larvae using either leaf disks or stem sections, higher numbers of larvae fed on grasses, such as orchardgrass, Dactylis glomerata L. or fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., compared to numbers feeding on other plants. In no-choice laboratory and field tests, larvae tunnelled into plant stalks at the same frequency by which they would feed on foliage, showing a tendency to tunnel into plants they accept as hosts. Third or fourth instar larvae preferred to tunnel into orchardgrass and rye, Secale cereale L. over the other plants present in field cage tests. The SB prefers to oviposit on narrow leaved, perennial grasses, such as fescue and orchardgrass, over wide leaved annual grasses or broadleaf plants. Significantly higher numbers of eggs were laid on upright over prostrate plants in cage studies. The SB also preferred ovipositing on desiccating or dry plant material. Higher numbers of SB infested corn seedlings were found next to field margins compared to numbers found within fields. Contour and transect maps of SB infested fields showed considerable aggregation over three years, and this distribution was confirmed by high variance to mean ratios, and small k values. SB distribution in no-till corn can be adequately described by the negative binomial model. Field collections of SB in corn stalks showed 2, 3, or 4 instar larvae infesting the youngest seedlings. Variation existed in larval development from year to year. Linear regression covariance analysis showed that larval development was different between field collected larvae from year to year.

AB  - Two poultry operation transects in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed were assessed for phytate and other phosphorus compounds using 31 P NMR. Samples soluble reactive P, total P, and organic P concentrations---in bicarbonate, Mehlich3, and water extracts---were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, combustion, and colorimetry. Calcium, iron, magnesium, aluminum, and manganese concentrations were assessed in the same extracts, as well as, NaOH-EDTA, to assist in identifying dominant metal-compound interactions that influence the transport and bioavailability of P compounds. This research established that phytate concentration decreases down-gradient of poultry manure-applied fields. Biological indicators such as phosphomonoesterase and anaerobic plate counts were employed to support the assertion that biological factors were playing a role in phytate hydrolysis. Isolation of new phytate-degrading, aerobic bacteria and an assessment of their phytate activity from one transect site, showed that each ecosystem is host to bacteria that can hydrolyze phytate to produce the eutrophication agent orthophosphate. In addition, this work shows that the biological transformation of phytate provides a latent pool of orthophosphate that is present in manures, soils, and sediments. New phytate-degrading bacteria were identified, specifically; Pseudomonas marginalis, Bacillus pumulis, Staphyloccus equorum, and Arthrobacter bergeri species were isolated, each of which could provide phytase enzymes for subsequent use as a feed additive for monogastrics. Finally, this work hints that more stringently controlled composting of poultry manure as well as the planting of simple riparian strips beside canals could result in a greater use of soluble reactive phosphorus by crop plants and a smaller release of SRP into the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - This thesis is an investigation of the visual qualities of landscapes valued by a rural community. Huron County was selected as the study area. Commonplace rural landscapes were selected, photographed and rated by 32 local residents. The residents also commented on which qualities most appealed to them in their preferred landscape choices. The data was analyzed in terms of visual elements and design principles. In general, the results revealed a preference for landscapes of design restraint, unity and moderation. However, intriguing subtleties emerged. Residents preferred hedgerows, driveways, roadside landscapes and lakeshores that were very orderly, and farmsteads and fields that were orderly but with variety. On the other hand, they preferred Forests/Woods and Rivers/Streams landscapes that were very natural, and, wetlands and residential landscapes that were natural but with some conscious design intent. Design that compliments vernacular landscape character is discussed.

AB  - Since 2006, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth has been considered the most problematic weed in agronomic crops across the Midsouth. As a result of glyphosate resistance, producers began to again utilize a diverse herbicide program for management of this weed, which consists of several soil-residual herbicides most notably diuron, fluometuron, fomesafen, and metolachlor. Fluridone inhibits phytoene desaturase in plants, and is unique in that its mechanism of action (MOA) is not currently registered for use in cotton. Studies were conducted to determine the length of residual that fluridone provides in controlling Palmer amaranth in Arkansas glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant cotton programs and along field margins in comparison to other soil-residual herbicides. Furthermore, studies were conducted to assess the persistence of fluridone in Arkansas soils and the risk for injury to crops subsequently planted following fluridone use in cotton. Regardless of the cotton program, fluridone failed to provide season-long control of Palmer amaranth; hence, reducing the number of postemergence applications will not be recommended when applying fluridone at cotton planting. Additionally, fluridone failed to provide season-long control of Palmer amaranth along ditchbanks over that of other labeled soil-residual herbicides; however, when applied under favorable conditions fluridone applied preplant incorporated provided extended control of Palmer amaranth with or without a sequential application. Injury to wheat as a rotational crop from an application of fluridone to cotton was greater than that of other crops commonly rotated with cotton; albeit, injury was not severe enough to result in wheat yield reductions. Although fluridone did not provide season-long control of Palmer amaranth, introducing a herbicide with a unique MOA into current cotton would be beneficial for reducing the risk of resistance to herbicides that are currently used in cotton.

AB  - Monoculture crop production and prevailing farming practices have greatly reduced perennial plants on the landscape and nearly eliminated native Iowa prairie vegetation. The STRIPs (Science-based Trials of Row crops Integrated with Prairies) project is a watershed-scale experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, in Jasper County, Iowa, US, in which strips of prairie vegetation were planted within watersheds of corn ( Zea mays ) and soybean (Glycine max ) production to aid in soil and water conservation. The project includes 12 0.5- to 3.2-ha watersheds. Nine watersheds included buffer strips in one of three design treatments that varied the number and position of strips and/or the proportion of the watershed converted to buffer and three watersheds were 100% crop. The present study investigated: (1) If the design of prairie buffer strips influenced their vegetation; (2) If the vegetation of prairie buffer strips shifted over time; (3) If prairie buffer strips caused a weed problem in adjacent crop fields. From 2008-2011, the identity and percent cover of plant species within the buffer strips were surveyed, and from 2009-2011, the identity and percent cover of weed species within the cropped areas of the watersheds were surveyed. Differences among treatments and among years in plant species diversity, percent cover, and composition were analyzed using ANOVA and NMS. The design of buffer strips did not influence plant species diversity or composition; however, buffer strip vegetation did shift over time. In 2008, the strips had 38 species (in 6 m 2 ) with 37% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 22% composed of native perennial species. By 2011, the strips had 55 species (in 6 m2 ) with 90% of the total plant cover composed of perennial species and 58% composed of native perennial species. In addition, NMS analyses indicated that the buffer strip plant community shifted from annual to perennial species. Within the crop, weed species richness and percent cover did not differ among watershed treatments, regardless of whether watersheds contained buffer strips or not. Prairie buffer strips greatly increased plant diversity in the watersheds; 380% more species were found in 6 m 2 of prairie buffer than in 6 m2 of cropland. Within four years of establishment, the buffer strip vegetation was predominantly perennial and native species, the target vegetation for both ecohydrological functions (i.e., erosion control) and for conservation. Furthermore, weed species richness or prevalence did not differ between watersheds that incorporated prairie buffer strips versus 100% crop watersheds. Therefore, converting 10-20% of arable cropland to prairie buffer strips successfully reintroduced perennial species and conserved native Iowa prairie without causing a weed problem in adjacent crops.

AB  - This study examines spatial and temporal changes in the boundary between California annual grassland and coastal sage scrub under disturbed and relatively undisturbed conditions in three southern California coastal valleys, two in Point Mugu State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains an one on Santa Cruz Island. The goals are to describe the boundary characteristics, to correlate changes in vegetation with environmental variables, and to assess the impact of ranching on the characteristics and the position of this boundary. Spatial changes between grassland and coastal sage were examined by comparison of air photos covering a 40-50 year period. These were interpreted with respect to ranching activities. Brush clearance and cultivation were important in expanding grassland and creating abrupt grassland/sage boundaries. Grazing prevented invasion of grassland by coastal sage. Cessation of cultivation and later of grazing led to invasion of grasslands by coastal sage, changing both the location and characteristics of the vegetation boundary. Vegetation and soils were sampled in fifteen transects placed perpendicular to the grassland/coastal sage boundary. Correlations between vegetation and environmental factors demonstrated the importance of disturbance and moisture-related soil variables in determining the gross aspects of vegetation structure. Soil nitrogen was correlated with diversity of herbaceous species. Shrub seedlings were associated with bare soil. Regression models and ordination of the samples supported these conclusions and pointed out the relation of other soil nutrients to species composition within the broader framework of each vegetation type. Quantitative description of the vegetation boundaries by differential profiles permitted their classification into two categories of abrupt boundaries and three categories of gradual transitions. Differences between these boundary types appear to be the result of differences in spatial distribution of disturbance, soil texture and compaction, and patterns of shrub invasion that may in turn be related to past disturbance patterns. It was concluded that disturbance often creates sharp boundaries between grassland and coastal sage. Cessation of disturbance will usually result in invasion of grassland by coastal sage, replacing abrupt boundaries with wider and more gradual transition zones. Clayey or compacted soils may inhibit shrub invasion, thereby maintaining abrupt boundaries.

AB  - The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, can be an economically important pest in Midwestern soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill. Soybean production has been altered since the discovery and establishment of this invasive insect in 2000. In 2001-2003, we evaluated the spring colonization of soybean aphid to better understand the population dynamics and make treatment recommendations. In a state-wide study of Minnesota, spring colonization began during the early vegetative stages and lasted approximately two weeks. The production of summer migrants started prior to the flowering of soybean and continued until pod set. On a relatively smaller scale, non-attractive pan traps were evaluated as a tool for describing the landing behavior of alatae aphids. Spring colonizing alates did not preferentially land at commercial soybean field edges. The precision and cost of pan trapping was compared to whole-plant counts. Both sampling methods were generally precise over the season, yet pan trapping may be too time-consuming for most research. The spatial and temporal within-field distribution of soybean aphid was examined using geostatistics. Variograms and kriged density contour maps also indicated soybean aphids did not have a landing preference during initial colonizing in early vegetative soybean. However, yield analyses indicate one well-timed insecticide application at the economic threshold can reduce loss. As a result of these small scale studies, site-specific management is not recommended as a tool to suppress soybean aphid populations. Two sampling plans were created as a method to estimate soybean aphid densities in commercial soybean. An enumerative (i.e., counting) sampling plan was developed for reaching desired precision; 310 plants are required for ecological research and 38 plants are required for pest management purposes. A binomial sequential (i.e., presence/absence) sampling plan was developed for making treatment decisions. A minimum of 11 plants are required to make a management decision using 40 aphids per plant as a tally threshold. Finally, a preliminary description of the mitrochondrial DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) provided evidence of the soybean aphid being genetically distinct from other closely related aphids and has not yet developed biotypes throughout native and introduction populations.

AB  - Agricultural practices may result in nitrate losses, diminished surface water quality and widespread groundwater aquifer contamination. Many works have identified preferential flow through macropores as an important feature that may increase nitrate losses. Subsurface drainage collectors may intercept preferential flow and indicate changing unsaturated/saturated processes. Antecedent conditions are important in determining runoff response. It is unclear how tile drains modify the antecedent soil moisture regime and water tables in near stream areas. Vegetated riparian buffer zones found between agricultural fields and watercourses may attenuate nitrate in shallow groundwater pathways. However, little work recognizes the close proximity of buffer strips and tile drainage systems nor studied their interactions. This thesis provides results from study at two sites within the 3.5 km 2 Strawberry Creek Agricultural Watershed in southern Ontario. The goal of the study was to identify some of the features controlling runoff and nitrate export from tile drained fields in agricultural watersheds with macroporous soils and narrow vegetated riparian zones.

AB  - Humans make decisions within ecosystems to enhance their well-being, but choices can lead to unintended consequences. The ecosystem services (ES) approach supports decision-making that considers all environmental goods and services. Many challenges remain in the implementation of the ES approach like how specific ES vary through space and time. We address this research problem using the Tualatin and Yamhill river basins in northwestern Oregon as a study area. Freshwater ES are quantified and mapped with the spatially-explicit ES modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST). In chapter II, we develop a simple urban land cover change modeling approach with selected stakeholder input. The products of this analysis are used in part to answer the question of how the freshwater ES of water yield, nutrient retention, and sediment retention will change in the future, and how their distribution potentially will change? In chapter III, these ES are modeled in InVEST using the land cover scenarios and three downscaled global climate models. The base period is 1981 to 2010 and the future period is 2036 to 2065. The models are calibrated to empirical estimates, and display different sensitivities to inputs. Water yield increases with higher rainfall but decreases with the highest temperature scenario. Nutrient export and retention estimates are positively correlated. In the Tualatin basin, more urban lands generally lead to increases in nutrient exports and retention. The effect is reversed in the Yamhill basin from much larger agricultural exports. Sediment exports and retention increase with higher winter rainfall but are negatively spatially correlated due to topographic effects. Simulation of a landscape scale installation of riparian buffers leads to decreases in exports and increases in retention. The distribution of the provision of freshwater ES remains unchanged throughout the scenarios. With few parameters in each InVEST model, all display a high degree of sensitivity. Parameterization is subject to high uncertainty even with calibrated values. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of InVEST's freshwater models. The spatially explicit nature of InVEST is its main advantage. This work coupled with other analyses in the study area can facilitate the identification of tradeoffs amongst ES leading to better ecosystem management.

AB  - Forty ex-arable field corner plantations, between 1 and 15 years old, were selected on chalky boulder clay soils in north-west Essex. Levels of soil total nitrogen, potassium and organic carbon increased over the 15-year span, whilst soil pH declined. The species richness of the ground flora was at times surprisingly high, but all species found were common and widespread. The plantations do not act as `weed reservoirs', as a floristic succession was observed: annual arable weeds are displaced by perennial weeds and wasteland plants, these in turn are partially displaced by grassland species, which are themselves eventually outcompeted by shade-tolerant hedgerow species. High levels of soil potassium appear detrimental both to overall species richness and the proportion of hedgerow species. Tree and shrub survival rates are typically around 75&#37, with failures levelling-off after about 9 years. These failures seem associated with high proportions of grassland species, and with high levels of soil organic matter and nitrogen. Vegetative colonisation by woody species increases over time, and this encourages the shade-tolerant vascular species. Area is important, with larger plantations being more species-rich, and having more self-sown woody seedlings. Plantations adjacent to a quality hedgerow or wood have greater numbers of woodland species, both vascular and woody, but the `wildlife corridor' concept is not supported. If left to regenerate without planting, the succession to woodland will take longer, and the resultant mix of woody species in field corners may be quite different from site to site. Floristically, the conservation value of field corner plantations is very similar to scrub, and thus equal to or greater than post-enclosure hedgerows. Their conservation potential can be improved through increased size, correct location, the inclusion of natural regeneration and management practices which maintain habitat diversity.

AB  - An erosion/sediment yield model designed for farm fields is needed to select Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control erosion and sediment yield. Closed form relationships for detachment, sediment transport and deposition for overland flow areas and field channels were developed. The new model estimates rill and interrill erosion and deposition for concave, convex and complex slopes. The model also estimates erosion, sediment transport and deposition for natural and grassed waterways and terrace channels for restricted and unrestricted outlets. Basic relationships in the new model are similar to those in the CREAMS model. However, the new model replaces the Yalin bed load formula used in CREAMS by a simple formula fitted to the Yalin formula. Unlike CREAMS, the new model simulates each particle type independently in case of multiple particle types, reducing cost and simplifyng the simulation process. A closed form detachment relationships for channel flow were obtained using the Binomial Theorem and similar mathematical techniques. The new model was programmed in Standard Fortran and then compared with the CREAMS model. Program size and simulation cost for the new model are nearly half that for CREAMS. The new model can analyze such effects as slope shape, grass buffer strip, conservation tillage, grassed waterways and other field channels with and without outlet control. When simulating long term records, estimates of sediment yield and sediment enrichment ratio by the two models are essentially the same. However, for single storm events large differences in sediment yield values and sediment enrichment ratio may occur. More specifically, large differences in total sediment yield values may occur when flow shear stress is low or slope profile is steep. Large differences in sediment enrichment ratio may occur when the sand fraction in the soil mass is high.

AB  - Ecological effects of plant protection chemicals and the intensity of farming were studied in spring cereal fields at Jokioinen in southern Finland. In the traditional plot experiment (plot size 100m2 ), effects of two insecticides, fenvalerate and permethrin, on soil animals and decomposition of straw were studied in 1991-1992. In the large scale experiment (1992-1995), effects of two pesticide regimes (conventional, reduced) and two types of farming systems (customary, integrated) on non-target arthropods were studied in large plots (0.7 ha). Succession of perennial grass strips at the margins of the treated plots and its impact on arthropod fauna were also studied. In the traditional plot experiment, fenvalerate and permethrin decreased the numbers of epigeal Arachnida, and Collembola, but effects on soil animals or decomposition rate of straw were not detected. Although the pesticide programme in the large-scale experiment included several pesticides, insecticides had the greatest effect on the non-target arthropods. In particular, dimethoate and deltamethrin had severe effects on non-target species, but pirimicarb was almost harrnless. Effects of insecticides on polyphagous predators (Araneae, Carabidae, Staphylinidae) lasted longer (2-4 weeks) than on vegetation-living insects (a few days), due to the different recovery rate by dispersal. Effects of farming systems on arthropods were clearly less significant than effects of pesticide use. Arthropod numbers and species richness were higher in the perennial strips than in the cereal fields. The perennial strips affected abundance of Araneae and Carabidae in the fields: catches near the strips were higher than further away. However, improved recovery rate after pesticide effects near the strips could not been detected. Botanical composition of the perennial grass strips changed over four seasons. During succession, the total number of plant species decreased and the cover of gramineous plants increased. Nevertheless, the perennial strips maintained a diverse community of Auchenorrhyncha and Araneae.

AB  - The Kaskaskia River is a large river system draining approximately 1,488,000 ha (IDNR, 1999) and is situated in central and southwestern Illinois serving as a tributary to the Mississippi River. Within the Lower Kaskaskia River Watershed (LKRW), an active urban-rural gradient currently exists in the Metro East area of St. Louis. Such areas of urbanization are particularly vulnerable to stream degradation. This study focuses on the effects of urbanization on water quality parameters within Silver and Richland Creeks, both of which are tributaries to the LKRW. Forty-three catchments within Silver and Richland Creeks were identified as study catchments. Stream water samples were collected within these catchments every two weeks in the dormant season and monthly in the growing season from January 2008 to August 2009. Stream storm samples were collected and stage was recorded within four intensively sampled catchments, which were representative of an urban-agriculture gradient. Stream samples were analyzed for total suspended solids, turbidity, pH, specific conductance, bacteria coliforms as total coliform, fecal coliform (FC), and Escherichia coli (EC), nutrients (orthophosphate, ammonium-N, nitrate-N, chloride, sulfate), and caffeine. Caffeine presence was measured in the LKRW to test whether it was a useful indicator of urbanization. Geographic Information System was utilized to identify catchment scale percent urban, agriculture, and forest land covers and riparian buffer scale percent impervious surfaces (RIS). Since the proportion of agriculture and forest land covers decreased as urbanization increased, catchment urban land cover (CULC) was used to classify categories of urban, village, and agriculture watersheds (>10.5%, >1% to 10.5%, and 0% to 1% CULC, respectively). RIS was classified through manual digitization of structures (i.e., buildings, houses) and roads (i.e., highways, streets) within 10 m, 30 m, and 50 m buffer widths of the main tributary within each catchment. Correlations of water quality variables to percent CULC were comparable to that of RIS. Stream water levels of EC, FC, and orthophosphate were relatively high in the urban, village, and agriculture watersheds. Regardless of watershed classification, levels of FC at both baseflow and stormflow and EC at stormflow far exceeded US EPA (400 CFU) and IL EPA (500 MPN) Review criteria, respectively. During baseflow, stream orthophosphate and nitrate-N concentrations within urban watersheds were significantly higher than in village and agricultural watersheds. The significant nutrient and bacteria levels in urban streams may be due to inputs via stormwater runoff, wastewater treatment effluent, and home septic systems. Caffeine concentration in streams was not a useful indicator of anthropogenic impacts within the LKRW study area. Among the four intensively sampled catchments, hydrometric data showed no significant differences in stream discharge, flow frequency, flow duration or baseflow index. Furthermore, event mean concentrations during stormflow for stream nitrate-N, stream orthophosphate, and stream sulfate were generally significantly lower in the two urban watersheds compared to both the village and agriculture watersheds. Results from this study demonstrate that watershed managers can utilize CULC since it is comparable to RIS. In addition, results illustrate the need for urban best management practices to reduce water quality impacts, such as storm water management, improved wastewater treatment, and maintaining or developing vegetated riparian buffers.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to achieve a higher level of understanding of the adoption and diffusion process of conservation technology on Iowa farms. The tools used in this discovery process are a qualitative analysis of farmers' perceptions of conservation technologies, an analysis of the adoption and diffusion model, and the formulation of a local dependency theory to explain the patterns of adoption on Iowa farms. Specifically, this investigation comes to the conclusion that the Iowa farmer is trapped in a dependency situation that is controlled by the government, trans-national corporations, and local capital, a triad known as the triple alliance. The resulting dependency hampers the adoption of technologies that do not benefit the triple alliance. The argument is based on an USDA funded study of mid-western farmers known as the Management Systems Evaluations Area project, or MSEA. The socio-economic, portion of the study employed the focus group and case study methods of investigating farmers' reaction to the conservation technologies of ridge tillage and permanent vegetative filter strips. The studies revealed a dependency situation on the farm that was preventing the adoption of the two technologies. As a result, the dependency theory of international development was reformulated to the local level of abstraction to explain the adoption process in relation to conservation technology adoption. The use of dependency theory to explain the adoption of conservation technology overcomes the traditional shortcomings of the widely accepted adoption model that originates from the modernization theory of development and the concepts of rational choice and the free market. The reformulation provides an understanding of the conservation technology adoption process that better fits the current sociopolitical situation of the Iowa farmers.

AB  - Vector competition analysis, a model for elucidating interspecific plant growth and nutrient interactions, was developed and validated using two case studies representative of contrasting agro-ecosystems. The first case study involved evaluating interactions between nutrient loaded and conventionally fertilized black spruce ( Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) seedlings with neighboring natural vegetation on various forest sites in northern Ontario. The second case study involved interactions between Leuceana leucocephala tree hedgerows inter-cropped with maize in an alley cropping system in western Kenya. In the first study, vector competition analysis revealed seedling growth was limited primarily by competition for N on competitive sites, while competition for light and or moisture was greater after fertilizing the same sites. However, nutrient loading countered weed competition on most sites. Similar analysis in the second study revealed competition for N limited maize production at low tree density (8 m wide alleys) while moisture and or light competition was greater at higher tree density (2 m wide alleys). Maximum maize performance was obtained at intermediate tree density (4 m wide alleys), and was associated with increased N uptake presumably due to N mineralized from added mulch. These results demonstrated the usefulness of vector competition analysis to quantify interspecific plant growth and nutrient interactions in a simplified and systematic framework. Since response parameters were compared relative to standardized reference treatments, a wide range of ecological conditions and management regimes could also be quantified and ranked.

AB  - Alley cropping, the growing of crops between rows of leguminous trees or shrubs, has been used to sustain crop yields in the tropics. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess suitability of tree species as hedgerows for alley cropping in terms of amounts and rates of N release in three environments, (ii) to assess effects of hedgerow management on soil C and N dynamics and (iii) to determine optimum hedgerow management that improves maize ( Zea mays ) yield and N-recovery. Five hedgerow species were selected on the basis of biomass yields for C loss and N release studies at each site. Species differed in C loss and N release patterns within sites. Initial leaf N concentrations correlated with C loss (phase I) whereas (lignin + polyphenol):N correlated negatively with N release rates (phase II). Application of prunings of Leucaena leucocephala and Delonix regia (calcareous site) Leucaena hybrid (basaltic site) and Acacia angustissima (high elevation) led to greater soil organic N than in control plots after 5 years. Stem-amended soils showed similar N mineralization among treatments within sites. Cumulative effects of Leucaena hedgerow management (pruning utilization by pruning regimes) on soil organic C and N dynamics were determined. Pruning application had greater organic C and N and potential mineralization than the control in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Addition of fertilizer did not increase soil organic C and N but, enhanced soil N mineralization. Application of Leucaena prunings increased maize yield and grain N uptake. Yield declined over seasons in the control and where prunings were removed. Addition of inorganic fertilizer increased further yields and N-recovery by maize. Over seasons, three-cut regime had higher maize yields and better % N-recovery than the two-cut regimes. Low N-recovery under the two cuts made at planting and 40 DAP indicated tendency for N immobilization under this pruning regime. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - &lt;p &gt;The objectives of this study in the Nakuru District of the Kenyan Highlands, the major milk sources for the Nairobi milk market, were to evaluate current dairy cattle rearing and feeding practices, and suggest efficient feeding management strategies on large and small-scale commercial dairy farms. 139 small-scale farms with 738 dairy cows were surveyed and 6 large-scale dairy farms with 4379 dairy cattle. On the small farms, high mortality rates, cost of AI, and disease were the major causes of poor reproduction leading to a lack of replacement stock. Feeding systems used were: 24% free grazing system, 33% semi-zero grazing, 40% zero grazing, and 3% rotational grazing, but limited feeds were available â¿¿ crops and feed crop residues, cut grass on the roadside, neighbouring farms with some purchased hay and straws in the dry season. After weaning, feed supplements were rarely given to calves, priority being given to milking cows, explaining the few replacement stock kept and their high mortality. The six large scale farms were from 200 to 3500 acres with milk production, cereal crops, fodder crops, the scale of replacement dairy stock and hay to other dairy farms the main activities with land allocated 65% to livestock, 20% to cash crops (Barley and Wheat), 10% to fodder crops and 5% to other land-uses. Replacement heifers for sale were insufficient to meet demands from small-scale farms. Grazing systems were mainly extensive with supplements fed at milking.Â All the farms depended on planted forage grasses, mainly: Rhodes grass, Star grass, Sudan grass and Kikuyu grass. Calf mortality rate (10-18 %) was high caused mostly by respiratory diseases and East Coast Fever. Extended age at first calving (&amp;gt;31.8 Â± 4.5 months), long calving intervals (&amp;gt; 406 days) and low average milk yields (6.81/day Â± 3.9) for all breeds, occurred. Production and reproductive performances needs to be addressed by proper nutrition. Suitable pasture grasses, legumes and fodder crops not currently being used have been identified as potential options to complement the existing pasture. Among these are: Guinea grass (panicum maximum), Cynodon dactylon, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Naivasha star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) and Rhodesian star grass (Setaria sphacelata). Other studies examining supplementation of animals on low quality pastures with the above feeds resulted in increased body weights and milk yields. The greatest potential seems to be supplementing with home-grown proteinaceous feedstuffs such as Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra, Sesbania or food crop residues like groundnut, cassava, sweet potato vines or pigeon-pea leaves and stems. Farmers could increase their pasture land productivity by establishing fodder grass, fodder shrubs and food crops as intercropping, hedgerows and along contour bands.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Bovine liquid manure (BLM) obtained from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) often is added to agricultural fields as fertilizer. Unfortunately, pathogens inherent to BLM might contaminate surface and ground waters via field runoff and expedited transport via field drain tiles. Buffer strips, placed at the edge of agricultural fields, can intercept pathogens that infiltrate into soil. Buffer strip efficiency to intercept pathogens is dependent on soil type and microbial attributes. Parameters for each have been included in models (e.g. the advection-dispersion model) that describe distance-dependent densities of microorganisms being transported with saturated water flow. In this model, C(t) /Co represents the ratio of bacteria that transport a given distance (x) and time (t) through soil from the application source. I hypothesized that (1) an advection-dispersion model could predict distance-dependent densities of fecal indicator bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus hirae ) commonly present in BLM. (2) Model predictions could be extrapolated to determine the minimum transport distance (depth of proposed buffer strip) required to decrease microbial densities within BLM to the levels suggested by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's Water Quality Standards (WQS), i.e. geometric means of 126 and 35 CFUs/100 mL, respectively. The project's objectives were to: (1) Formulate a semi-pervious soil that could be used to construct buffer strips using components (sand, clay, and plant material) obtained in northwest Ohio. (2) Use formulated soil in microcosms of three lengths (30, 45, and 60 cm) to obtain numerical values for the model parameters: fluid velocity, v; dispersivity, αL; initial injection volume, V o ; and single collector efficiency, η. (3) Obtain values for distance-dependent densities of fecal indicator bacteria in BLM during transport through the microcosms, and determine whether the advection-dispersion model predicted these values by using a correlation analysis. (4) Use the model to make predictions of distance-dependent densities for bacterial transport through simulated buffer strips and compare the resultant predictions to observed effluent densities from field lysimeters containing formulated soil. (5) Extrapolate the data to predict transport distances that are needed to sufficiently reduce BLM derived microbes, i.e. buffer strip widths needed to obtain target densities of bacteria. Outcomes for each goal included: (1) A soil was formulated by combining sand (60 % by volume), clay (20 % by volume), and dried plant material (20 % by volume). Formulated soil had an infiltration rate of 123 mm/hr and fluid velocity of 0.015 - 0.025 cm/s; (2) Model parameters had the following values: single collector efficiency (η = 6.16 x 10 -2 ); dispersivity (αL: 30 cm = 2.17 cm; 45 cm = 2.28 cm; 60 cm = 5.41 cm); and initial injection volume (Vo = 0.014 - 13 mL). (3) The maximum ratio (C/Co ) of indicator organisms in effluent from the microcosms decreased with soil depth (E.coli - 30 cm: 0.11, 45 cm: 0.061, 60 cm: 0.0265, E. hirae - 30 cm: 0.11, 45 cm: 0.032, 60 cm: 0.016). The precision of model predictions decreased with system size (R2 : E. coli - 30 cm: 0.978, 45 cm: 0.987, 60 cm: 0.741; E. hirae , 30 cm: 0.852, 45 cm: 0.737, 60 cm: 0.638). (4) Results from a correlation analysis of model predictions and field lysimeter data yielded a difference in model precision between indicator species (E. coli : R2 = 0.4828; E. hirae : R2 = 0.020). (5) Lysimeter data were used to predict minimum soil distances needed to decrease bacterial densities to WQS; E. coli and E. hira e required 254 cm and 282 cm of soil distance respectively. A buffer strip that contains soil formulated to optimize infiltration rate and provides a minimum of 254 cm of subsurface flow will reduce the threat of contamination from BLM-derived pathogens to surface waters.

AB  - <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Hedgerow fruits provide a food resource for several <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> farmland bird species from late summer, through winter and into spring. This project aims to develop the understanding of the interactions between fruit-bearing hedgerow flowers, their pollinators, hedgerow fruits and frugivorous birds. Experiments revealed that flowers of blackthorn, hawthorn and ivy all benefited from insect visits in order to develop fruit. The flowers of bramble and dog rose showed little requirement for insect pollination, and produced fruit when insects were excluded. There was evidence that for the hedges under study, the pollination service provided by insects to blackthorn and hawthorn flowers was inadequate since the flowers of these plants were pollen limited. The relative abundance of different insect groups foraging on blackthorn flowers was highly variable between hedges, suggesting that the contribution of a particular insect group to blackthorn pollination may vary according to their local density. Bumblebees, bristly flies and solitary bees were considered to have the greatest value for pollinating blackthorn flowers, based on foraging attributes (bumblebees and solitary bees), and abundance (bristly flies), but their activity did not correlate with the proportion of flowers that set fruit. Solitary bee activity correlated with hawthorn pollination, and there was strong evidence that social wasps were the best pollinators of ivy flowers on the hedges studied. Environmental factors such as hedge aspect did not significantly affect the activity of most pollinators (with the exception of solitary bees) or the proportion of blackthorn flowers that set fruit. Equally, the presence of the mass-flowering, attractive forage source, oilseed rape in fields adjacent to hedgerows, did not significantly influence the activity of most pollinators or the proportion of hawthorn flowers that set fruit. The abundance of some frugivorous birds, in particular the migratory thrushes (redwings and fieldfares) was positively related to the yield of fruits, including sloes and haws in hedges. So the evidence suggests that on these farms, pollinator communities are important for ensuring some hedgerow shrubs provide copious fruit, which may be vital for birds during winter months when invertebrate food is scarce. These links between flowers, pollinators, fruits and birds are discussed, alongside suggestions for safeguarding the fruit supply for farmland birds in the future.<o:p></o:p></span> ]]>

AB  - This study examines the effects of two riparian buffer widths on microclimate variables, shade-producing canopy cover, and the temperature of stream water in multiple clearcut harvest units adjacent to a fish bearing (Class I) stream in northern California. Data collected before and after timber harvest operations in years 2000, 2001, and 2002 was analyzed to determine changes in response variables to wider (175 ft.) or narrower (100 ft.) riparian buffers. Angular canopy cover was measured to be 85% at mid-stream and no less than 80% within the riparian buffer regardless of buffer width. Vertical canopy cover was measured to be 50% within the riparian buffer for each harvest unit following the first phase of timber operations. Microclimate results show that edge effects from the adjacent upslope clearcut harvest units had no discernible impact within 40 ft. of the stream bank. No difference in the extent of microclimate edge effects within the riparian zone was found for either the 175 ft. buffer or the 100 ft. buffer under very warm summer conditions. This study found that two separate timber harvest operations, conducted in summer 2000 and summer 2001, resulted in only minor (±1.5°C) changes in the water temperature pattern along the experimental reach. The monthly maximum water temperature never exceeded 21.1°C before or after harvest throughout the study area. In general, the trend of the data over the three-year study showed upstream and downstream average, minimum, and maximum water temperature response values becoming more homogenous over time. Water temperature results from this study are consistent with previous research that concluded forested buffer strips either maintain stable water temperature patterns or sustain only minimal increases in daily maximum water temperatures (<2°C) after upslope timber harvesting. In this experiment, no practical difference in the canopy cover, near-stream microclimate, or water temperature patterns were found between the wider 175-ft. and the narrower 100-ft. buffers. The lack of change in response variables was likely due to the very small measurable reduction in shade-producing canopy cover mid-stream and within the riparian buffer. Only minimal changes in the near stream microclimate and water temperature occurred despite the fact that 35% of the merchantable tree volume within the riparian buffer was removed during summer 2000 timber harvest operations. Results from this study show that 100-ft. vegetative buffers that maintain at least 50% vertical or 80% angular canopy cover minimize potential negative impacts to the temperature of stream water and the near-stream microclimate from adjacent upslope clearcut harvest operations.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has resulted in reduced biodiversity on farmland. A consequence of this decline is the potential loss of ecosystem services. The effects of intensification on native bees in agricultural habitats are not well understood. The objective of this study was to compare bee diversity in hedgerows on conventional and organic farms in order to assess how different management techniques affect bee populations. Bee diversity data was also analyzed in relation to other field variables, floral diversity and landscape structure. Bees were sampled by pan trapping and netting in hedgerows adjacent to soybean fields on 9 pairs of organic and conventional farms in Eastern Ontario, Canada during the summer of 2009. Bee diversity did not differ between farm types at the local scale; however bumble bee abundance was higher on organic farms in intensively managed landscapes. The amount of semi-natural habitat emerges as the most important factor for bee populations.

AB  - Transferring plot and reach scale hydrologic understanding to the catchment scale and elucidating the link between catchment structure and runoff and solute response remains a challenge. To address this challenge, I pursued the following questions as part of this dissertation: How do spatiotemporal distributions of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic connectivity influence whole catchment hydrologic dynamics and what are the implications of this for stream biogeochemistry? What are the implications of catchment structure for riparian buffering and streamflow source water composition? What are the hierarchical controls on hydrologic connectivity and catchment runoff dynamics across 11 diverse headwater catchments and across flow states? I addressed these questions through detailed hydrometric monitoring and analysis (160 recording wells across 24 HRS transects and stream discharge across 11 catchments), tracer sampling and analysis (groundwater, soil water, and stream water sampling of major ions, specific conductance and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), and newly developed digital landscape and terrain analyses. I installed this unprecedented network of instrumentation to address these questions across 11 adjacent and nested catchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF), Rocky Mountains, MT. I determined that (1) hillslope topography, specifically upslope accumulated area (UAA), was the first order control on the duration of transient water table connectivity observed across HRS landscape positions; (2) the intersection of HRS connectivity with riparian area extents determined the degree of riparian groundwater turnover, riparian buffering of upslope water, and the magnitude of DOC transport to streams; (3) 11 catchments' stream network hydrologic connectivity duration curves were highly correlated to streamflow duration curves and the variable slopes of these relationships were explained by vegetation, geology, and within catchment distributions flowpath length and gradient ratios. This dissertation consists of five key chapters / manuscripts that address how landscape structure/organization within and across catchments can control the timing and magnitude of water and solutes observed at catchment outlets.

AB  - Riparian areas are fundamental to the ecological health for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest. Efforts to protect riparian areas for salmon recovery have typically focused on public land acquisitions and habitat restoration projects to meet near-term goals. This study evaluates the effectiveness of regulatory and voluntary conservation land use tools used for protecting riparian areas in the Lake Washington/Cedar/Sammamish watershed (Water Resource Inventory Area 8 [WRIA 8]) based on the presence or absence of land cover change. Aerial imagery from 2006 to 2009 and a vegetation change model developed by Kenneth Pierce with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife were used to characterize land cover change. In the last decade, new and more stringent land use regulatory tools and voluntary land use incentives have been established to help advance long-term strategies, such as conservation easements, transfer of development rights, Urban Growth Areas (UGA), and Critical Areas Ordinance (riparian buffers). The absence of land cover change in the riparian areas of parcels with conservation easements and TDRs are positive indicators that these conservation land use tools can be an effective alternative approach for advancing salmon recovery efforts. The presence of land cover change due to development and transportation projects associated with public and private lands inside the UGA was more than expected. Evaluating the effectiveness of riparian buffers administered by the local jurisdictions of WRIA 8 proved challenging, as jurisdictions and landowners are allowed to mitigate the riparian buffer width permitting variations. There is still much to learn on how jurisdictions are applying these new land use tools and how well they are working.

AB  - Most of the animal waste from hog production in eastern North Carolina is temporarily stored in anaerobic lagoons before being applied to agricultural land as organic fertilizer. Two immediate concerns of such a system are lagoon safety and nutrient loss from the application fields. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the lagoon performance in a land application system using DRAINMOD, and (2) evaluate the effect of two Best Management Practices, controlled drainage (CD) and vegetative buffer strips (VBSs), on drainage water quality. Lagoon safety and performance was evaluated by conducting long term simulations using DRAINMOD. Crop nitrogen budget, lagoon mass balance, and lagoon emergency operation routines were added to the original model. While the current emergency design standards are based on the 24-hour, 25-year storm, the most hazardous period for lagoon operation was during wet winter months. In summer months, a lagoon usually had the storage space for severe storms because of high evaporation and frequent waste application. In order to avoid lagoon overflow nitrogen application had to sometimes exceed the requirement of cover crops. Field drainage conditions and cropping systems also affected lagoon performance. A field experiment was conducted to monitor drainage water quality from waste application fields in eastern North Carolina. Controlled drainage and VBSs were implemented. Occasional high concentrations of nitrogen in drainage water (>100 mg/L, mostly still in the form of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)) were caused by applying waste on wet soils. Lower drainage outflow from controlled drainage treatments was observed, as well as reduction of Total-P on the treatments with VBSs. However, the treatment effects were generally overshadowed by short duration high concentration periods. Nitrogen and phosphorus loss could be high in the short period after waste applications. Using a 20 day screening window, we found that up to 90% of the annual loss occurred after six application events. Runoff volume and water table depth at the time of application were found to be important factors affecting the loss. Based on the relationship between the nutrient loss and hydrologic factors derived from the field measurements, long-term simulations showed that nutrient loss could be reduced by requiring deeper water table depth prior waste application. However, this also reduced the total amount of wastewater that could be applied and treated due to narrowed operation windows on poorly drained soils.

AB  - Agroecosystems dominate the U.S. landscape, and conversion of natural land to crop fields is often cited as a leading threat to biodiversity. Agricultural practices designed to enhance biodiversity can provide farms with ecological services such as pollination. Insect pollinators, including bees, are widely considered to be indicators of ecosystem health as a result of their co-evolved relationships with the plants they pollinate. This study explored whether native plant hedgerows have a positive effect on pollinator presence. Bees were collected from six organically managed farms in Central California, four of which had hedgerows and two that did not. On hedgerow sites, bees were sampled at varying distances out from the hedgerows. Native bee abundance and diversity were markedly greater on hedgerow sites. Additionally, native bee presence and species richness were higher in samples collected within the hedgerow than in those collected at further distances from these native plantings.

AB  - The overall goal of my research was to assess the potential for integrating bird conservation on farmlands while enhancing production goals through augmentation of insect pest control. Working on selected conventional and organic farms in North-central Florida my study objectives were to (1) assess habitat characteristics on and adjacent to farms influencing avian species diversity and insect-foraging activity, and to identify 'functional insectivores' on these farms; (2) determine the effectiveness of sunflower intercrops as refugia for, both, insectivorous birds and beneficial insects in cropped fields, and as tools to enhance insect-foraging by birds in cropped areas; (3) test the hypothesis that insectivorous birds can potentially augment pest control programs involving hymenopteran parasitoid predators, via active preferences for unparasitized over parasitized prey. Using a combination of bird surveys and focal foraging observations over two years, I determined that bird diversity in cropped and non-cropped habitats on farms varied in the following ways; (a) vegetation type in field borders significantly influenced species richness per census point (F 5,30 = 3.5, P = 0.013) and in field borders (F5,30 = 3.8, P = 0.009); (b) mixed crops generated significantly greater bird densities per point (F1,30 = 7.4, P = 0.011) and in cropped fields (F1,30 = 8.2, P = 0.008) and (c) foraging activity and abundance of functional insectivores were greatest in mixed crops (F1,29 = 4.2, P = 0.051). In a replicated, controlled field experiment I determined that intercropping rows of sunflowers significantly increased densities of birds (F = 43.33, p < 0.001), attracted greater numbers (F = 57.51, p < 0.001), and increased foraging time by individual insectivores in crops (F = 50.18, p < 0.001). Visual observations and stomach samples confirmed that birds consumed economically important pest insects. In feeding trials blackbirds exhibited no preference between parasitized and nonparasitized lepidopteran larvae of similar body size (Z = -7.44, p = 0.46) but a significant preference for larger non-parasitized prey (Z = -3.93, p < 0.001). My study suggests that managing farmland habitat can enhance wild bird populations and the potential that they can augment pest control programs in modern agricultural operations.

AB  - Trenbolone acetate (TBA) is a potent synthetic androgen that is widely used to promote weight gain in beef cattle. A possible consequence of its use is endocrine disruption in aquatic vertebrates, which could occur if trace concentrations (>10 ng/L) reach receiving waters. While the ecotoxicity of TBA metabolites, including 17alpha-trenbolone (17α-TBOH), 17β-trenbolone, and trendione, have been reasonably well characterized, their fate and transport in the environment is poorly characterized. Therefore, lab, plot, and field scale experiments were used to quantify the mass of TBA metabolites that could transport from agro-ecosystems to receiving waters. Observed leaching of 17α-TBOH from manure during irrigation closely matched estimates made from a 1-D diffusional model, suggesting that leaching during irrigation was diffusion limited. When applied to rainfall events, the model drastically underestimated the leachable mass, likely because it didn't account for physical disturbances due to raindrops. Therefore, a power model based on rainfall intensity was fit to the data to describe leaching under different rainfall scenarios. Based on these models, 1,600-22,000 ng and 1,800-4,000 ng 17α-TBOH is expected to leach during 1-5 cm rainfall events and 6-12 hour irrigation events, respectively. To evaluate attenuation, 17α-TBOH was continuously applied to 3-5 m vegetative buffer strips, and ~80% removal was observed. While >97% removal was expected based on equilibrium partitioning, colloid facilitated transport and non-equilibrium conditions likely limited removal. Based on these data, concentrations in runoff from irrigated pastures were predicted to be <1 ng/L, but actual first flush concentrations were 11 ng/L. Runoff concentrations dropped from 11 ng/L to 2 ng/L after only 3 m of overland flow and exceeded 1 ng/L levels for <30 minutes. During rainfall events from small (6-10 m 2 ) plots, average 17α-TBOH concentrations were 2 ng/L. Using mass balance estimates, runoff concentrations are expected to be <1 ng/L as long as stocking densities are <25 animals/hectare, which is the upper limit recommended for pastures. Given a likely no observed effects concentration of 1 ng/L, the ecological risk due to TBA use on well-managed pastures is low. When cattle excrete wastes directly into surface waters, however, several attenuation processes (e.g., sorption, transformation, infiltration) are ineffective, and concentrations are expected to increase 15-20 fold. Furthermore, while densities of 25 animals/hectare is the upper limit for pastures, animal feedlot densities can be much higher, and with higher implant dosages, concentrations as high as 100-250 ng/L are predicted in runoff from feedlots, indicating that the risk of transport on feedlots is substantially larger compared to more diffuse rangeland or irrigated pasture sources.

AB  - Hedgerows constitute a major wildlife habitat in many areas of Britain. The theory of island biogeography, and in particular the equilibrium model, is often invoked to explain the characteristics of communities inhabiting habitat patches. The particularly interesting feature about hedgerows is that they are both a linear, and often an interconnecting patch-type. Landscape ecology addresses the spatial and temporal relationship between patch and matrix habitats and may, therefore, contribute to an understanding of species distributions in hedgerows. Hedgerows on arable land in North Yorkshire and Oxfordshire were studied to assess which factors influence community characteristics and to determine the relevance of island biogeographic and landscape ecological concepts. Three contrasting wildlife groups were studied. First, a plant study addressed the extent to which habitat area can be used to predict species richness. Only in Oxfordshire did a significant species-area effect exist. Hedgerow isolation was also investigated by using indices of connectivity and with the formulation of a hedgerow accessibility index that attempted to measure the degree of physical connectance of a hedge to the surrounding hedgerow network. These indices were only of minor interpretive value and both their conceptual limitations and the difference between functional and physical habitat connectance is recognised. Second, a small mammal study investigated the habitat preference of species and the movements of individuals in and around hedgerows that were either isolated or well connected to others. Species-specific patterns in field/hedgerow preference and movement behaviour were observed. There appeared to be no reliance on hedgerow connections for inter-hedge movement although the presence of nearby roads and verges may have modified movement patterns. Third, a study of millipedes and woodlice addressed both the effect of hedgerow connections and the influence of soil properties on species distributions. Soil pH appeared to be a major determinant of community composition. Hedgerow configuration history and the possibility of `relic' communities are discussed. It is considered that the role of hedgerows as habitats and corridors will depend upon the autecology of the species considered, the quality of the hedgerow habitat and the nature of both the adjacent fields and their surrounding hedgerow network. Island biogeographic concepts are unable to model adequately community characteristics in hedgerows both because of their often narrow and interconnecting nature and because of the temporarily variable land matrix in which they are set. Landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics may be more profitable conceptual frameworks within which to address the community characteristics of hedgerows.

AB  - A series of field experiments were designed to examine the role of hedgerows in maintaining a rich and diverse invertebrate community and to determine the function of hedgerows as corridors along which invertebrates can move through farmland.Intrinsic and extrinsic hedgerow characteristics were assessed for their potential to provide a suitable habitat for a diverse and abundant invertebrate population, in order to develop a classification system based on their attractiveness to invertebrates. Although this was not possible due to the great number of interacting variables and small sample size, some interesting associations were nevertheless revealed between floral and fauna species. The taxonomic composition and spatial distribution of invertebrates in the hedge was explored by means of a new sampling technique, developed to allow a reliable method for assessing arthropod populations within hedges. From only 4% of the total hedge area, 15 orders and 70 families of invertebrates were identified, with 90% of the 13,390 individuals belonging to six dominant orders. The spatial distribution of arthropods was found to be aggregated at both ends and in the middle of the hedge.Invertebrate movement along hedges was examined in two consecutive years by monitoring reinvasion back into a repeatedly sprayed section of hedge, in order to explore the role of the hedgerows as a movement corridor. A wide variation in the ability of invertebrates to recolonise was displayed. In the first year polyphagous predators were fastest to reinvade, possibly regulating the rest of the population by predation to a new lower level, while scavengers were the first to recolonise in the second year. The influence of spatial continuity (gaps) and connectivity (nodes) of the hedge on movement was explored for ground-dwelling arthropods. Gaps in the hedges of between 7-9m did not inhibit movement of carabid beetles, while hedge nodes, seemed to attract a high number of carabids, possibly due to local microclimatic conditions.It was concluded that hedges provide one of the most important non-crop habitats in agroecosystems, in terms of the diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna they support, and through their connectivity with other landscape features provide an important continuum of habitat for invertebrates on farmland.

AB  - Understanding the source of insects within an agricultural production system is essential to selecting the most suitable management practices. In this thesis, I examine the spatial patterns of arthropods in Michigan commercial celery systems and evaluate whether field margins are sources of insects therein. Insect abundance was measured at different distances within six different celery fields located in southwest Michigan during 2013 and 2014. Most herbivores were evenly distributed throughout the field, although minor edge effects were detected when overall abundance was low. Herbivore abundance in margins, relative to the field, varied across groups; tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers are key pests that may be using margins for habitat. Most predators were evenly distributed across the field. Syrphid flies were more abundant in margins, suggesting greater association with these areas than other groups. Parasitoid abundance was also consistently margin-centric across groups during both seasons. In 2014, I performed a mark-capture experiment in which three field margins were sprayed with a protein marker. Arthropods were subsequently captured and tested for the presence of the protein. Most groups had at least one individual testing positive for the presence of the marker, but the majority of specimens in every group tested negative. Variation in mark percentage, as well as the spatial distribution of marks, showed that some groups, such as tarnished plant bugs and syrphid flies, utilize the margins more than others. Any systematic change in the way growers manage their margins would likely affect these groups to a greater degree than the other groups in the study.

AB  - Clearing of catchments draining into the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (Queensland, Australia) has increased sediment and nutrient loads in river runoff. The extent of land cover change and the intensification of land use were analyzed for the Pioneer River catchment near Mackay (from Landsat images, 1972--2004), and for the estuary (from aerial photographs, 1948--2002), to determine whether and how loss of natural vegetation has affected sediment delivery to nearshore waters and adjacent coral reefs. Geochemical proxy records of weathering and sediment delivery to the sea, deposited in skeletons of living Porites corals from inshore (5 km from Pioneer mouth) and midshelf (32--51 km offshore) reefs, were analyzed to determine the spatial and temporal extent of terrestrial impacts. High-temporal resolution (∼weekly) concentrations of barium (Ba), yttrium (Y) and calcium (Ca) were measured by laser ablation inductively-coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), while annual samples of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) were measured by solution ICP-MS. Major trends emerging from integration of contemporaneous terrestrial changes, marine geochemical proxies and climate records include: (1) A 33% net decline (1972--2004) of forests on alluvial plains as farms encroached into riparian zones; and a 22% net decline (1948--2002) of tidal mangroves in the estuary. (2) Ba/Ca correlations with Pioneer River discharge were influenced by wind direction and strength; but there was no apparent temporal change in Ba/Ca since 1946. The absence of enrichment in mean inshore Ba/Ca ratios (versus midshelf reefs) may be due to biological recycling by phytoplankton, which may restrict Ba availability. (3) Mean Y/Ca ratios from inshore (5 km) corals were 3.1 and 3.6 times higher than from midshelf (32 and 51 km) corals, and inshore REY abundances were ∼2--5 times higher than from mishelf reefs. Inter-annual REY variation on both inshore and midshelf sites was correlated significantly with year and discharge, while long-term temporal trends in maximum annual Y/Ca, normalized to Pioneer River discharge, appear to reflect both agricultural expansion and changing management practices. (4) The combination of high turbidity and high nutrient discharge from the Pioneer River may be affecting benthic community composition on both inshore and midshelf reefs.

AB  - Agricultural production is a major cause of non-point source pollution in the U.S. Alley cropping, grass barriers and terraces can significantly contribute to reduction in soil and nutrient losses, and therefore, sustain crop yield and improve water quality. In the southeastern U.S, there is an emerging interest in research for alley cropping and grass barriers as alternative soil conservation barriers to costly terraces. Data are lacking for the performance of these alternatives and no studies have compared them in Alabama. This research was carried out at the North Alabama research center in Cullman County, Alabama, on a Hartsells sandy loam soil, 6.5% field slope, to study the effectiveness of alley cropping of mimosa, blackberry and switchgrass hedges in (i) reducing surface runoff, sediment yield and nutrient losses, (ii) sustaining crop yield and nutrient uptake, (iii) improving soil physical and chemical properties, and (iv) returning benefits to farmers compared to underground pipe outlet parallel terraces or no barrier control. Terraces were the most effective barriers and significantly reduced surface water runoff, sediment yield, NH4 -N, NO3 -N, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), total K, Ca and Mg by 74, 84, 64, 84, 76, 76, 78, and 79%, respectively, compared to the control. Switchgrass hedges were the second best soil conservation barriers by reducing the same parameters as for terraces. Blackberry hedgerows were the next best barrier after those of switchgrass but did not significantly reduce total K, whereas the plot had the highest loss of NH 4 -N. Mimosa hedgerows ranked fourth and did not significantly affect any form of N and total K losses. Vegetative barrier effect reduction in surface runoff and sediment and nutrient concentrations and yields, progressively improved over time. Indeed, 2002 and 2003 were establishment years and vegetative barriers effectiveness is expected to improve in the next few years. Most losses occurred during year 2003, which was the rainiest and generated the highest runoff losses. Conservation barriers' effects on nutrient losses contributed to improve water quality in the receiving stream compared to cultivation without barriers. Corn and cowpea yields were not significantly affected by treatments at the 0.05 probability level. Alley cropping and terraces had a minimal effect on crop yield, especially for corn, despite a 7% reduction in cropping area due to the barriers. Terraces and alley cropping did not significantly affect the removal of most nutrients. However, harvested sweet corn in switchgrass and mimosa treatments had significantly lower N removal than did the control, blackberry and terrace treatments. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Targeting agricultural conservation practices to farmland that has the greatest impact on surface water quality has received wide support from scientists and watershed managers. The targeting approach has, however, been politically contentious as many believe farmers will oppose the approach on grounds such as privacy invasion and unfair distribution of government incentives. Targeting conservation practices using complex optimization models has become common in the scientific community, and yet targeted results are underutilized in practice because of difficulties such as knowledge transfer and absence of a political framework for their use. For targeting to be successful, it must be politically supported in concept and practically demonstrated in implementation. In this work I have conducted an interdisciplinary study and targeting experiment that brings together the human dimensions of targeting with the engineering tools of watershed modeling and spatial optimization to demonstrate an adaptive targeting approach. The approach is adaptive in its involvement of stakeholders, namely farmers and landowners, in the targeting process. Fourteen farmers were engaged through in-depth interviews about their farmland, conservation practices, and opinions on targeting of conservation. Interviews and the targeting experiment were conducted in 2012-2013 in two small west-central Indiana watersheds--the Little Pine watershed (56 km 2 ) and Little Wea watershed (45 km2 ). There was general support for the targeting approach among farmers interviewed, despite wide variation in farmer views of conservation and government programs. Farmer views of differing conservation practices varied as well, supporting a flexible targeting approach where farmers are consulted prior to targeting conservation on their lands. The watershed modeling and spatial optimization approach tailored to farm boundaries was a suitable tool for targeting field scale practices at the watershed scale. Conservation practices represented in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) varied in effectiveness of reducing total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment from reaching surface waters. Grassed waterways, filter strips, and strategically cited wildlife habitats had the greatest efficiency in lands with little existing conservation, and cover crops and wetlands were capable of intercepting nutrients and sediments other practices could not reach. The adaptive targeting experiment resulted in a stated intention to adopt 35% of all targeted recommendations across ten farms. Interviews clearly improved the targeting approach, provided an avenue for knowledge transfer, and built trust with farmers.

AB  - Tetrastichus asparagi Crawford (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is the primary parasitoid of the common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Failure to control the common asparagus beetle effectively will affect the yield and growth of the plant. This study assessed the bionomics, parasitism and the impact of pesticides on T. asparagi and the common asparagus beetle. In the field, standard commercial practices for control of the beetle were compared to an integrated pest management approach. Parasitism by T. asparagi was very low in all the treatments. Eggs collected from a carbaryl and chlorpyrifos treated field, had zero parasitism. The insecticides free asparagus fields had 14.2-50.9% parasitism depending on the methods of asparagus crop management. In the laboratory, all the insecticides tested caused 100% mortality to T. asparagi. The fungicide chlorothalonil also caused 10-60% mortality of T. asparagi in the bioassay. Asparagus beetle eggs and honey water as food increased both longevity and fecundity of T. asparagi in laboratory studies. Volunteer asparagus ferns and nectar producing plants in the field and field margins can enhance T. asparagi survival and longevity.

AB  - In Malawi, poor management of farmlands and use of agrochemicals result in acute forms of non-point source (NPS) water pollution. However, research data and information allowing evaluation of effects of NPS pollution and control measures on water quality are limited. This study evaluated effects of cropping systems and vetiver grass ( Vetiveria zazaniodes ) on reduction of non-point-source pollution from croplands. The crops evaluated were maize (Zea mays L .) and burley tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum ) against bare plots as controls. Surface runoff samples were collected in field pits and analyzed for suspended sediments, NO3 -N, total phosphorus and organochlorine (OC) pesticide residues to determine on-site material losses. The results obtained showed higher material losses from the maize plots than the tobacco plots due to differences in crop canopy height development and structure. The losses were higher at the beginning of the season when the soil was dry, bare and still loose from previous tillage than at the end of the season when the soil became compacted. The results also showed that vetiver grass hedgerows can significantly reduce sediment and nutrient losses in surface runoff. The vetiver grass effect on pesticide residue loss reduction was, however, less definitive suggesting that trace levels of OC residues may not be sensitive to the cropping systems and management practices used. A study of off-site effects investigated changes in stream discharge and water quality with respect to seasonal rainfall and smallholder farming activities. The results obtained showed that the variability in flows and pollutant loading in Mtemankhokwe Stream depended on seasonal rainfall/runoff patterns. Suspended sediment and total phosphorus pollution were dominant during high stream flows while nitrate (NO 3 -N) contamination was dominant during low flows, suggesting a concentration dilution effect downstream. Also, this phenomenon suggests that runoff and soil erosion control in the watershed can reduce non-point source pollution from croplands in watersheds. Overall, the establishment of a long-term research and monitoring program could improve our understanding of the seasonal changes in water quality and would also enhance detection of long-term changes in stream discharge.

AB  - Alley cropping is a crop production system in which food crops are grown in the alleys created by hedgerows of selected tree species, preferably legumes. The objective of this study was to model a Cassia/maize alley cropping system in the semi-arid district of Machakos in Kenya. The modelling was done with respect to the system's ground water dynamics as it affects its biomass production. First the dynamics of water in a bare soil was modelled, and then Cassia and maize were introduced separately and their biomass production modelled with respect to water. Finally, a combined Cassia/maize/ground water model was build and analysed. The model suggests that water is a critical factor in the biomass production of Cassia and maize. The main achievement of this project has been to provide a starting point for a framework in which empirical research results can be integrated and interpreted in a more holistic manner.

AB  - Analyses of physical trade flows over the last decade reveal that the global South is running ever higher physical trade deficits. These deficits are being magnified by the increased export of both resource-intensive and pollution-intensive commodities onto the world market. A primary aim of this dissertation is to empirically demonstrate support for the theory of unequal ecological exchange in the case of Turkey and the European Union. This research undertakes three levels of analysis: cross-national, national, and local. The dissertation attempts to answer the following questions: To what extent have Turkey's natural resources been appropriated at the global level through the process of unequal ecological exchange? What are the economic and political conditions that give rise to unequal ecological exchange? To what extent is unequal ecological exchange occurring between Turkey and the EU? What are the socio-ecological impacts of unequal ecological exchange in the Köprülü Canyon and its buffer zones? Answers to these questions are derived from both quantitative (physical accounting and regression analyses) and qualitative methods (20 semi-structured interviews and previous research results from my unpublished MA thesis), relying heavily on long-time data series analysis. In contrast to the Netherlands Fallacy, the findings showed that Turkey increases its impacts on the environment within "her" borders through the exportation of resources and importation of wastes--a process which is conceptualized as the Turkish Fallacy -- the overconsumption of resources in both primary and secondary sectors of the economy. The increase in physical flows of agricultural exports has resulted in deterioration of both "cropland" and "agroforestry" reserves over four decades. As articulated by the theory, resource consumption and ecological degradation paradox, and a decrease in biocapacity, are at least partly a function of cores that utilize their advantageous positions in the global economy to externalize their consumption-based environmental costs to Turkey. These findings showed that not only the materials but also the consumption of fossil fuels embedded in agricultural trade has increased. This finding supports climate change for the Turkish case. Turkey had the largest increases in "energyland deficit"; whereas, the core has been able to outsource energy inefficient sources of income to Turkey, increasing the "entropy" of Turkey. This study also reveals how environmental surpluses are extracted from Turkey through trade. Turkey has been a net-exporter of "dirty" manufacturing over forty years. As "dirty" physical net-exports created pollution havens--an indication of the second contradiction of capital-- the amount of "energyland" embedded in "dirty" manufacturing production has also increased. The findings run counter to macroeconomic orientations that predict an environmental Kuznets curve. The results show that the energy embedded in Turkish manufacturing production, and the carbon intensity of Turkish trade is the dissipated energy and carbon dioxide produced by trade. The deeper analysis of unequal ecological exchange showed that through the export of 'dirty' products, the EU is creating a 'pollution haven' in Turkey, contributing to cropland degradation while protecting the EU's cropland through trade. The expansion of European capital accumulation is predicated on the consumption of growing quantities of natural resource flows from Turkey to the EU-15. This study reveals that the physical exports of Turkey are more pollution-intensive in comparison to the flows of the EU-15. Also, Turkey's embodied crop/grazing land in exports is higher than that of the EU-15. The EU appropriates ecological space through trade without having to deal with its local ecological consequences. The undervaluation of natural resource exports is a key mechanism of unequal ecological exchange and valuation fails to account for local negative externalities associated with nat ral resource extraction. Hence, these costs are encountered at local levels, such as in the destruction of the subsistence base and sustainable ecological and social system of the yayla -farmers at Köprülü Canyon who are subsidizing the profits of foreign capital. The yayla -peasants became exporters of various crops and became more dependent on external market conditions. They experienced the degradation of their cultivated land due to the pressure of production on resources rather than due to excessive population pressure on these resources. The forest ecosystem of the Köprülü Canyon shows an unsustainable growth path over several decades. As a result of social class transformation, the exporting corporations become the winners; whereas, the majority, including semi- yayla farmers, become victims of unequal ecological exchange.

AB  - This project was initiated to identify and quantify levels of pesticides in the River Tall in compliance with the Water Framework Directive (WFD).Â It was also intended to investigate the significance of fate and transport of pesticides in the catchment and the associated risk of contamination of the River Tall. Monitoring of the River Tall indicated the presence of simazine, atrazine, terbutryn, ethylene thiourea (ETU), carbendazim, diuron, isoproturon and monuron at parts per quadrillion levels (pg/L) i.e. well below the threshold value (0.1 &#956;g/L) set by the groundwater directive.Â Diazinon, ETU and fenbuconazole were prioritised for fate and transport studies.Â Atrazine and linuron were used as reference compounds.Â The soil half-life (DT<sub>50</sub>) at 10Â°C for test compounds varied from &lt;1 -538 d.Â The mobility of the test compounds at 20 cm depth in soil varied from &lt;0.001-1.37% of the applied amount under controlled environmental conditions.Â Under field conditions, the mobility of the test compound varied from &lt;0.001-1.63% of the applied amount at 10 cm depth in soil.Â The restricted movement of pesticides could be due to the dominance of carbon enriched soil types (surface water gleys) in the catchment.Â The main routes of entry for pesticides could be via spray drift or surface runoff.Â However, the normalised loads of chemicals contained in surface runoff reported in this study represent worst-case scenario based on the microscale experiments.Â At the macroscale, various factors such as dilution by uncontaminated rain, infiltration and accumulation of pesticide runoff in the riparian buffer etc can result in a reduced availability of these chemicals to enter and thus contaminate the River Tall. The above results indicate that the risk of contamination of the River Tall from the use of pesticides in the catchment is not significant.

AB  - Rational utilization of wood requires an adequate knowledge of its properties. In tree stems, the juvenile and mature wood zones can exhibit entirely different properties. Therefore, it is important to know how the properties of the juvenile wood core differ from those of the outer layers of mature wood. Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) properties are relatively unexplored in plantation-grown tress. In New Brunswick, plantations are at an adequate age to provide well developed trees needed to draw reliable conclusions. This study concentrated on property variations in the radial and height directions of a single stem. Wood properties studied were: maximum crushing strength parallel to grain, relative density, tracheid length and longitudinal shrinkage. The sample tree was 23 m in height, 55 years old and 400 mm in diameter at breast height. The levels studied were 1.5, 4.5, 9.5, and 13.5 m above the ground. All wood properties studied showed pronounced trends with radial age. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Methane (CH4 ), nitrous oxide (N2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) fluxes from agricultural landscapes may contribute significantly to regional greenhouse gas budgets due to stimulation of soil microbial activity through fertilizer application. Few studies have made measurements of CH4 , N2 O, and CO2 from the dominant landscape features of the agricultural landscape: farmland, riparian zone, and wetland habitat. This study assessed gas emission variability from the Mississippi Delta agricultural landscape and explored the effects of hydrology and hydrophytic vegetation on gas emissions. Gas collection chambers were utilized to make gas measurements from soybean and corn farmland, vegetated riparian buffer, and two vegetated wetlands in summer of 2013. CH4 emissions were highest in the wetland, CO2 emissions were highest in the riparian zone, and N2 O emissions were highest in the farmland. Percent soil moisture was lowest in the farmland and increased into permanently-flooded wetlands. CH4 emissions were positively-correlated with soil moisture (R2 =0.31), while N2 O emissions were negatively-correlated (R2 =0.29). CO2 emissions, fit with a polynomial trendline, were significantly-correlated with soil moisture (R2 =0.33). To assess the effect of hydrophytic vegetation on wetland and riparian zone gas emissions, aboveground vegetation was clipped at the soil surface prior to gas sampling and compared to vegetated chambers. Wetland vegetation had no effect on gas emissions, while riparian zone vegetation had a slight inhibitory effect on gas emissions. Gas emissions were compared between two wetlands with contrasting hydrologic regimes, yet existing in the same drainage system. One wetland was used for agricultural irrigation and thus experienced fluctuating water levels, while the other wetland had stagnant conditions due to upstream beaver activity and impoundments. CH 4 emissions were higher under stagnant hydrologic conditions, whereas CO2 emissions were identical between the two. N2 O consumption occurred under stagnant conditions, and N 2 O emission occurred under fluctuating hydrologic conditions. This study indicates that gas emission hotspots exist on the agricultural landscape and are influenced by distinct habitat soil moisture levels. Hydrophytic vegetation did not play an important role in gas emissions, but hydrologic variability was important in creating conditions suitable for microbial gas production and emission.

AB  - The aim of this project was to provide a framework for future habitat management schemes aimed at conserving bumblebee populations in agro-ecosystems. I focused on the identification of landscape components that could be of value in the implementation of future conservation schemes. Specifically, two areas where individual bumblebees display ecological 'choice' were investigated; forage choice, and nest-site choice. The availability of suitable forage resources and nest sites are two important components in the continued survival of bumblebee populations on agricultural land, and must be considered in planning any conservation scheme.One way in which increased melliferous forage can be provided in agro-ecosystems having impoverished floral diversity is through allowing natural regeneration along field margins, or sowing these with a wildflower seed mix. I found that margins of both types attracted a higher density and diversity of foraging bumblebees than corresponding edges managed as conservation headlands. Floral diversity was found to be a much more important component of overall attractiveness than floral density, and perennials were a much more attractive resourse than annuals; the preference of different bee species for different forage plants indicates that conservation schemes could have a species-specific component.

Subterraneous nesting species (B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. lucorum) showed a strong preference for searching along banks, whilst B. pascuorum, B. hortorum and B. ruderarius searched preferentially along edges with tussocky vegetation. B. lapidarius in particular was most frequently observed searching along exposed boundaries; this species has a higher temperature threshold, and nests along exposed edges may maximise the heat reservoir effect of the soil.

AB  - The aim of this project was to provide a framework for future habitat management schemes aimed at conserving bumblebee populations in agro-ecosystems. I focused on the identification of landscape components that could be of value in the implementation of future conservation schemes. Specifically, two areas where individual bumblebees display ecological 'choice' were investigated; forage choice, and nest-site choice. The availability of suitable forage resources and nest sites are two important components in the continued survival of bumblebee populations on agricultural land, and must be considered in planning any conservation scheme. One way in which increased melliferous forage can be provided in agro-ecosystems having impoverished floral diversity is through allowing natural regeneration along field margins, or sowing these with a wildflower seed mix. I found that margins of both types attracted a higher density and diversity of foraging bumblebees than corresponding edges managed as conservation headlands. Floral diversity was found to be a much more important component of overall attractiveness than floral density, and perennials were a much more attractive resource than annuals; the preferences of different bee species for different forage plants indicates that conservation schemes could have a species-specific component. Growing certain crop species could greatly supplement the floral resources provided by areas of semi-natural vegetation, especially such nectar-rich 'novel' crops as Onobrychis viciifolia . Newly emerged queens displayed interspecific site preferences when nest searching along field boundaries. Subterraneous nesting species ( B. terrestris , B. lapidarius , B. lucorum ) showed a strong preference for searching along banks, whilst B. pascuorum , B. hortorum and B. ruderarius searched preferentially along edges with tussocky vegetation. B. lapidarius in particular was most frequently observed searching along exposed boundaries; this species has a higher temperature threshold, and nests along exposed edges may maximise the heat reservoir effect of the soil. It is clear that a range of different boundary types need to be provided if nesting requirements of a variety of bumblebee species are to be met.

AB  - Clear-cut logging, and removal of riparian canopy, can result in considerable increases in solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm) flux to streams, and may increase the exposure of aquatic organisms to UVR by altering the export of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial catchment. Riparian buffer strips have been adopted to mitigate the effects of canopy removal, however, the width and composition of prescribed buffer strips can vary, and provide variable shading to the stream. Experiments were performed along coastal streams in British Columbia to examine the effects of UVR from canopy removal on stream algal, invertebrate, and fish communities. I performed in-stream and mesocosm experiments that manipulated the exposure of stream biota to UVR by using solar exclusion filters which removed all, or portions of, incident UVR. Increased solar UVR exposure to streams either from direct canopy removal or declines in DOM significantly decreased total invertebrate biomass and community diversity, particularly during low-flow summer months. Increased UVR exposure affected riverine food-webs in a complex manner, clearly altering community interactive processes such as herbivory. Increases in UVR exposure had even greater effects on communities when they occurred in combination with increased water temperature. The effects of UVR on benthic food-webs varied across the spectrum, with UVA (320-400 nm) predominantly inhibiting benthic algae, and UVB (280-320 nm) having the most pronounced effects on invertebrates. No significant effects of UVR on benthic communities occurred under old-growth canopies, which had significantly more diverse invertebrate assemblages. Attenuation of UVR by dissolved organic matter was important for protecting organisms from inhibitory effects of UVR, with concentrations between 2-5 mg/L DOM in a critical concentration range for biological effects. Juvenile coho salmon that live in these coastal systems avoided high intensities of solar LTVA in experimental enclosures, suggesting that UVR may influence microhabitat selection by salmonids. These results demonstrate that increases in solar UVR exposure to streams from clear-cutting, either by directly removing riparian canopy or changing DOM, has severe effects on the productivity, diversity, and functioning of coastal stream ecosystems.

AB  - Naturally-functioning riparian ecosystems provide important habitat for wildlife and serve as corridors for individuals to move from one area of suitable habitat to the next. Site-level quality and landscape-level connectivity of wildlife habitat are of critical importance to myriad species across the landscape in southern Illinois. However, multi-scale analyses of habitat suitability and connectivity of riparian corridors are rare in the literature. The first objective of this study evaluated microhabitat quality at 4 streams (3 treatments, 1 control) restored 30 years ago following strip mining for coal in Perry County, Illinois. Microhabitat differences were very minor among restored and control stream sites. Of the 41 variables measured, 14 differed among sites, 4 of which were uncorrelated: canopy cover, overstory hard mast, bare ground, and herbaceous ground cover; thus, restored riparian buffers were comparable to unmined sites, indicating that restoration efforts were successful. The second objective assessed broad-scale habitat connectivity of stream corridors across the Coastal Plain, Shawnee Hills, and Southern Till Plain Natural Divisions in southern Illinois. Landscape metrics were measured from 3,157 ha of riparian buffers utilizing the 31 longest stream segments across these study sites. Of the 39 variables measured, 17 differed among sites, 3 of which were uncorrelated: mean patch size of forested area, area-weighted mean shape index of wetland patches, and the mean nearest neighbor distance between wetland patches. The Shawnee Hills division had the largest mean patch size of forests, Coastal Plain wetlands had the most connectivity via mean nearest neighbor metrics, and Southern Till Plain wetlands were the most fragmented via their area-weighted mean shape indices. These findings can be useful to land managers when preserving or restoring riparian wildlife habitat in southern Illinois and throughout the Midwest.

AB  - Differences in soil quality have been detected between operator-owned and rented land, however, these differences are not indicated to have resulted from differing annual crop and soil management practices. Moreover, differences have been detected in the rate of employment of durable soil inputs (tile drainage, grassed waterways, wind breaks, etcetera) between operator-owned and rented land. This indicates that the observed differences in soil quality resulting from tenure are more from a lack of durable soil inputs on the rented parcels than from differing annual crop and soil management practices. Current lease content and/or lease characteristics are significantly related to annual crop and soil management practices implying that reworking of lease arrangements can change the rate of employment of these practices. Significant relationships were not found, however, between lease content and/or lease characteristics and long-term durable soil inputs. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Denitrification is recognized as the major mechanism for reducing nitrate (NO3- ) in riparian buffers and thus diminishing non-point source pollution (NPS) of surface water bodies subject to high N loads. However, increasing denitrification rates in riparian buffers may be trading the problem of NPS pollution of surface waters for atmospheric deterioration and increased global warming potential because denitrification produces nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a greenhouse gas also involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. Also N2 O produced in the denitrification process can be dissolved in groundwater and is eventually emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. Riparian buffers restored from cultivated crop fields may have significant capacities as sinks or sources of CH 4 . It therefore is important to quantify the fluxes of N2 O, CH4 and dissolved N2 O, identify the source of N 2 O from different kinds of riparian buffer systems and evaluate the significance of N2 O and CH4 sources. We measured N inputs, weather conditions and N2 O and CH4 fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. We measured concentrations of NO3- , dissolved N2 O, and other chemical properties in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and the adjacent crop field. The forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density; and higher pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium (NH 4 + ) than those in the crop field. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (1.8-4.5 kg N2 O-N ha-1 ) were significantly less than those in the crop fields (7.2-16.8 kg N 2 O-N ha-1 ), but no differences among different kinds of riparian buffers were observed. Our results indicate that the emission factor (ratio of N2 O emission to N inputs) of soils in riparian buffers was smaller than the crop fields. While N2 O peak emissions followed by rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils significantly contributed to annual N2 O emissions from soils in the crop fields, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events. Soil incubation with inhibitors indicated that the main sources of N2 O might be nitrifier denitrification and denitrification in the crop field soil and nitrifier denitrification in the riparian buffer soils. The ratio of N2 O to N2 in riparian buffer soil (0.88-6.8) was less than that found in crop field soil (16.5). These results suggest that N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field. In both a multi-species riparian buffer and a cool-season grass filter, NO 3- concentrations in groundwater were significantly decreased in comparison to those in the crop field, by 48-59%. However, dissolved N 2 O concentrations in groundwater did not differ among locations (6-14 μg L-1 ). These results indicate that the riparian buffers decreased NO3- concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N2 O losses. Methane fluxes in crop field soil were not observed to be significantly different from those in the forest buffer and grass filter soils, and no significant difference in CH4 flux was found between the forest buffer and grass filter soils. Annual CH 4 flux was -0.80 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , -0.46 kg C ha-1 yr-1 , and 0.04 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters, respectively. The annual CH4 flux in forest buffers and grass filters were not significantly different from zero and these three amounts were not significantly different from one another. These results suggest that (1) N2 O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers were significantly less than those in the crop field, (2) the riparian buffers decreased NO3 - concentrations in near-surface groundwater, without increasing N 2 O losses, and (3) CH4 flux in the crop field, forest buffers and grass filters were not different and CH4 flux was not changed in the forest buffers and grass filters soils, despite that soil properties have changed significantly since the planting of the forest buffers and the grass filters.

AB  - Tree species identification is important for a variety of natural resource management and monitoring activities including riparian buffer characterization, wildfire risk assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and wildlife habitat improvement. Coordinate data from airborne laser scanners can be used to detect individual trees and characterize forest biophysical attributes. Metrics computed from LIDAR point data describe tree size and crown shape characteristics. The intensity data recorded for each laser point is related to the spectral reflectance of the target material and thus may be useful for differentiating materials and ultimately tree species. The aim of this study is to test if LIDAR intensity data and crown structure metrics can be used to differentiate tree species. Leaf-on and leaf-off LIDAR were obtained in the Washington Park Arboretum. Field work was conducted to measure tree locations, heights, crown base heights, and crown diameters for eight broadleaved species and seven conifers. LIDAR points from individual trees were identified using the field-measured tree location. Points from adjacent trees were excluded. We found that intensity values for different tree species varied depending on foliage characteristics, the presence or absence of foliage, and the position of the LIDAR return within the tree crown. In terms of the intensity analysis, the classification accuracy for broadleaved and coniferous species was better using leaf-off data than using leaf-on data while in terms of the structure analysis, the accuracy was better using leaf-on data than using leaf-off data. The stepwise cluster analysis was conducted to find similar groups of species at consecutive steps using k -medoid algorithm. When using both LIDAR datasets showed the most reasonable clustering result compared with the result using either one of the datasets. The research presented in this dissertation provides a significant contribution to the understanding of how various tree species can be identified through the structural and spectral characteristics derived from LIDAR data.

AB  - The recent changes in land use planning in Ontario and the increase in watershed planning studies provide an opportunity to create a management framework for riparian buffers among the institutional actors. Given these opportunities and a need to coordinate activities, it is necessary to determine if an integrated approach can be applied to a riparian buffer management framework. To this end, an institutional analysis is undertaken to examine the applicable provincial and municipal agencies operating in the Grand River watershed in southern Ontario. The analytical framework considers five aspects: context, legitimation, functions, structures, and organizational culture and attitudes. The results of the institutional analysis indicate that several statutes, including the Planning Act, Weed Control Act, and the Fisheries Act, influence buffers although there is limited buffer policy and limited financial assistance to promote buffer creation. Nonetheless, agency integration for buffers requires improvement, and several opportunities exist to facilitate integration. These opportunities include the establishment of a lead agency to coordinate buffer establishment and management, the use of watershed planning, and the creation of a common policy or strategy for buffers among the various agencies for buffers. Watershed planning is becoming more widely adopted in Ontario, and is an excellent mechanism to integrate buffer management. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - In British Columbia, the Canada-British Columbia Environmental Farm Plan Beneficial Management Practices Program (BMP Program) encourages the adoption of agrienvironmental practices on farms. The BMP Program is a voluntary and confidential program, which is jointly funded by the BC Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Since 2005 the BMP Program has provided funding to farmers to adopt agri-environmental Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) and during this time no evaluation of the program has occurred resulting in a lack of program feedback to program directors. The specific objectives for this project were to (1) develop a methodology to conduct a social, economic and environmental outcome evaluation of BMPs adopted on BC farms; (2) evaluate the social, economic and environmental outcomes of four BMPs and; (3) make policy recommendations to the Ministry of Agriculture to allow for adaptive management of the BMP Program using the evaluation methodology. The four BMPs evaluated for this study included Alternative Watering Systems to Manage Livestock, Riparian Buffer Establishment, Irrigation Management, and Wildlife Damage Prevention. The evaluation was undertaken for four BMPs with partially overlapping surveys, which were administered with a sample of BMP adopters in the fall of 2011 with in-person interviews as well as with mail surveys. The surveys collected both baseline and social, economic and environmental BMP outcome data. Results show that environmental outcomes are positive but in some cases depend on on-going maintenance and upkeep of certain BMPs. Generally adopters of the Riparian BMPs are motivated by stewardship and environmental factors whereas adopters of the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs are motivated by on-farm benefits offered by the BMPs. The largest barrier to adoption for all BMPs appears to be cost; however, barriers are overall lower for both the Irrigation Management and Wildlife Damage Prevention BMPs , which is reflected in the adoption levels to date. Results of the study highlight both the outcomes of the BMP to individual farm operations, and the overall impact of the BMP Program to society and also provides critical feedback to program directors.

AB  - This study examined socio-economic factors that drive the conversion of the rangelands into cultivation in a context of rangelands managed under conservation and development land use policies. Specifically, it compared the extent and factors of rangeland conversion to cultivation between and within land-use zones managed under conservation-biased policies and those managed under development-biased policies. The study was conducted in Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) and Loliondo Game Controlled Area (LGCA) buffer zones of the Serengeti National Park (SNP), chosen on the basis of generally comparable ecological, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, but different land-use policies. NCA pursue conservation compatible policies whereas LGCA pursue land-use policies that allow for almost all sorts of land-uses. The results show interesting variations in the level of households' involvement in cultivation and the magnitude of rangeland conversion that reflect the varied influence of conservation and development policies. NCA had more households that were cultivating (96%) compared to LGCA (87%). However, there was more land converted to farmlands in the LGCA (4.02 acres per household), as opposed to the NCA (2.36 acres per household). Conservation policies, particularly the controls over cultivation, in-migration, and management of the range resources in the NCA account for the low levels of rangeland conversion in the NCA. All the NCA sample households (100%) wanted to cultivate, and majority would increase the size of their farms if not for the controls on tools to be used. In the contrary, development-biased policies which do not regulate in-migration and land-use were encouraging rather than limiting conversion of the rangelands. In the LGCA, the only limitation was ecological conditions in some of the sites. In-migrant cultivators and the use of tractors and ploughs were allowed, and extension services for the development of cultivated crop were available. Households of different socio-economic and occupational backgrounds - pastoralists and non-pastoralists, residents and in-migrants, the poor and the rich - were all cultivating, but with a generally low acreage compared to cultivator communities outside the buffer zones. Wealthier pastoralists and the few settled pensioners however, owned and cultivated larger farms in both zones. In all these sub-groups, cultivation was contributing significantly to subsistence needs and herd-building. Despite the increasing cultivation, land cover change associated with human activities between 1975 and 2000 was very small compared to other buffer areas in the east African rangelands protected areas. This suggests that the current levels of cultivation in the study area can be maintained without much threat to the purposes for which the buffer zones are created. It was therefore concluded that the buffer zones ought to be managed under policies that regulate in-migration and land-use, foster growth in the livestock economy, and, allow small-scale cultivation among pastoralists.

AB  - <![CDATA[1. This research project on small mammals was carried out between December 1994 and August 1997 at the Leeds University Farms in West Yorkshire.<P>2. Densities of captures were assessed using weekly live trapping and mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods. One hundred and thirty two Longworth traps were set out in a complex farming landscape consisting of four replicate blocks of silvoarable agroforestry designed as a series of tree rows planted at low density (178 trees/ha) and separated by arable alleys cropped with cereals (wheat or Barley). Adjacent to each of these agroforestry systems is an area of trees planted at forestry density (2500 trees/ha), an arable field and a mature hedgerow.<P>3. Overall 1680 captures were obtained, 70% of which were of <I>Apodemus sylvaticus</I>, 20% of <I>Sorex araneus </I>and only 10% of <I>Clethrionomys glareolus</I>.<P>4. <I>A. sylvaticus </I>and <I>S. araneus</I> showed preferences for the agroforestry system, whereas <I>C. glareolus </I>preferred the mature hedgerows. Overall, the highest density of capture was found in the tree rows (13.4 animals per 100 trap nights) and the least in the arable field (4.2 animals per 100 trap nights).<P>5. Densities of captures of <I>A. sylvaticus </I>were greater in Autumn than the other seasons, notably in the tree rows when the arable areas provide little cover.<P>6. Population densities were calculated and showed the same seasonal pattern as densities of captures. The highest population density was in October 1996 (36 mice/ha).<P>7. Male <I>A. sylvaticus </I>bred extensively from mid-Winter until early Summer. The female had a longer and more sporadic breeding period. Overall, the animals showed little or no breeding condition during the phase of population increase in the Autumn-Winter period.<P>8. Radiotracking of <I>A. sylvaticus, </I>estimated using 95% of the density distribution, was between 0.04 and 0.30 ha. Home ranges of males were larger than those of females and showed seasonal patterns, with larger ranges during the Spring-Summer period which corresponds to the breeding season.]]>

AB  - With tropical deforestation a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, the land use decisions of small-scale farmers at the forest margins have important implications for the global environment. In some tropical forests, such as the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, farmers practice a shifting cultivation system that maintains large amounts of land under forest fallow. I examine whether local benefits of fallowing such as soil restoration, erosion mitigation and hydrological regulation are of sufficient value to farmers to stem the expansion of permanent cropland at the expense of forest. I quantify the value of ecosystem services provided by fallow to agriculture and test whether local forest externalities are economically significant, using farm survey and GIS data from the Eastern Amazon. I estimate a production function to determine the contribution of on-farm and upstream fallow to income, using an instrumental variables approach to address endogeneity. I find that on-farm and upstream fallow are both associated with higher farm income. This result both confirms the agronomic evidence that fallow boosts yields and suggests that fallow provides positive hydrological externalities to downstream farms. I also examine whether farmers respond strategically to their neighbors' land use, taking advantage of ecosystem services provided by upstream farms. I use a spatial econometric model to estimate the effect of upstream farms' fallow on downstream land allocation. I find no evidence that farmers alter their fallowing based on land use upstream. I then investigate whether market failures encourage fallowing. If farmers cannot purchase inputs used in cultivation due to liquidity constraints, they may keep more land under fallow than optimal. I use the estimated production function parameters to determine whether each farm's allocation of land between cropping and fallow is efficient from an individual perspective. I then estimate the effect liquidity indicators on land use efficiency. I find that over-fallowing is negatively associated with commercial credit use and off-farm income, suggesting that liquidity constraints do hinder agricultural intensification. Because I find evidence to support the existence of positive externalities to fallow, the loosening of liquidity constraints that encourage fallowing has ambiguous implications for community-level welfare.

AB  - A survey comparing buffering of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) by natural forest buffers and grass filter strips was conducted at 11 farms in three northeast Missouri watersheds. Results from the survey examining 74 CFPs occurring in row crop fields found that natural forest buffers dispersed flow from 80% of CFPs before they reached the stream, and grass filter strips dispersed 100%. It was estimated that 473 metric tons of soil moved to the riparian buffers via CFPs since the last tillage. Of the 473 metric tons, 97 metric tons of sediment was estimated lost to stream channels, all through natural forest buffers. Results suggest that the presence of higher densities of rooted vegetation and the wider buffer areas of grass filter strips are responsible for the higher percentage of buffered CFPs. Adding a grass filter strip along natural forest buffers may improve water quality by reducing sediment loss to streams.

AB  - This dissertation examines income-earning and agricultural strategies of households living in Kalabancoro zone, a Bamanan village 15 km southwest of the core of the city of Bamako, the capital of Mali, upstream along the Niger River. The population, predominantly farmers, used to grow vegetables and rice on the river borders and staple foods on rainfed fields. In recent years, the village has been literally invaded by the city of Bamako, provoking conflicts among people who need land for diverse uses such as dwellings, commercial enterprises, farming, and herding. The research focused on the range and types of economic activities that native inhabitants and those who migrated into the area are mixing to survive and/or to accumulate, with particular attention to how their differential access to land, labor, and capital affects the choices they make. It documented recent changes and new diversifications in the resource allocation practices of households, including their systems of production and the types of crops planted, that have occurred as a result of farmland shortages, and their increased involvement in the national and world market economies. By using an anthropological perspective to examine coping strategies of households living in Kalabancoro zone whose farmlands were consumed by the expansion of the City of Bamako, the research intended to contribute to a better understanding of the significance of peri-urban agriculture in the survival of the urban poor, especially in Africa. The specific questions investigated were: how do households cope with fluctuations and financial risk in the larger context of political, macroeconomic, and demographic changes? What opportunities for, and constraints to employment exist? Which strategies succeed or fail? I used two concepts in responding to these questions: (1) "agrarian change in Africa" and (2) "household." Some of the main findings are: (1) the indigenous population's farmland is being transferred to immigrant households, without bringing about any accumulation of wealth to the former; (2) Migrants' land is being used primarily not for agriculture, but for the construction of homes and rental houses; (3) to survive, households combine dry season intensive horticulture, rainfed agriculture, and informal economic activities. Women are the first victims of land shortage and must rely on petty trade to make a living.

AB  - The three papers of this dissertation embrace interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving in Conservation Biology. The first paper, A Comparison of Alternative Strategies for Cost Effective Water Quality Management in Lakes , examines whether septic system improvements or riparian buffer strips are the more cost effective strategy to improve lake water clarity in Minnesota. The paper is a response to the often used but incomplete approach to mitigating declining water quality of identifying the major sources of phosphorus. This addresses only half the problem because identifying pollution sources still does not tell us what the appropriate policy response should be. The paper couples a traditional water quality model with an economic model and in turn offers a more policy relevant analysis. For a large majority of lakes, buffer strips are the more cost effective strategy to achieve a given water clarity goal. The second paper, Group Hug for Lakes: The Determinants and Efficacy of Social Capital in Minnesota Lake Associations is based on survey work of roughly 500 lake associations in Minnesota. Using regression analysis, I explain the determinants of participation rates by lakeshore residents in lake associations. Then, using participation rates as a proxy for social capital, I provide some evidence that increased social capital is associated with better water clarity. Thus, not only bio-physical but institutional factors affect lake water clarity. The third paper, Adaptive Harvesting in a Multiple Species, Multiple Use Coral Reef Ecosystem , adopts a unique approach to bio-economic harvest modeling by examining at the effects of harvesting at two trophic levels in a coral reef ecosystem by adaptive rather than optimizing agents. Modeling human behavior as adaptive is not only more realistic but also places people in a more interactive role with their environment. The results indicate that the dynamics of the ecological system are very sensitive to economic and biological parameter values, exhibit threshold effects, and are determined by initial conditions. As compared to traditional, single-species, optimization harvest models, the model presented offers some counterintuitive results and a richer set of policy alternatives to managing coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - A large-scale field project was conducted on the Boreal Shield near White River, Ontario, to investigate the ecological implications of forest watershed disturbance by logging on stream habitat conditions, benthic invertebrate communities, and leaf litter breakdown processes. In the comparative study, there were no significant differences between logged and reference watersheds in stream habitat measurements or riparian conditions, but there were significantly lower decomposition rates of leaf litter in streams of logged watersheds. This was accompanied by significant differences between logged and reference watersheds in the community structure of aquatic invertebrates on leaf packs. These differences were largely the results of significantly lower abundances of two leaf-shredding caddisfly taxa, and a detritivorous mayfly in streams of logged watersheds. Effects on litter decomposition and leaf-pack invertebrate communities were linked to upland logging disturbances because riparian areas were undisturbed. The mechanisms or pathways by which upland logging disturbances were conveyed to instream processes and biota were not directly measured but may be related to peak flow increases from logged watersheds. In the experimental study, the partial harvest in riparian buffers resulted in 10, 20 and 28% average basal area of riparian forest removed at the three logged sites. At the two more intensively logged sites, there were small (<10%) reductions in canopy cover and no significant changes in solar radiation at stream surfaces. There were no measurable impacts on stream temperatures at two of the three logged sites. At the most intensively logged site, daily maximum temperatures were significantly higher (∼4° C) for about 6 wks in the first summer after logging than in pre-logging years or at reference sites. Temperature increases were attributed to a logging-induced temporary disruption of cool water inputs from ground disturbance in a lateral-input seep area. No significant differences from sedimentation patterns at reference sites were detected for two of the three logged sites. At the site with the more intense riparian logging, significant increases of about 3-5 times higher than pre-logging or reference levels were detected in fine inorganic sediment (250 μm-1 mm) load and accumulation, but not in fine organic sediments or very fine sediments (0.5-250 μm), in the first year after logging. The increased inorganic sediment deposition at that site was temporary with no significant differences from reference or pre-logging levels detectable by summer of the second post-logging year. Post-logging leaf litter decomposition rates at the experimentally-logged sites were not significantly different from pre-logging or reference rates. This is in contrast to the findings from the comparative study, and plausible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. At the two sites with the more intensive riparian logging, no significant postlogging differences from reference streams were detected among a suite of invertebrate community metrics and composition measures. At the 3 rd logged site, there were significant post-logging differences from reference and pre-logging measures of invertebrate communities, and these were largely the result of increases in some leaf-shredding stoneflies, and a detritivorous mayfly, concomitant with decreases is some chironomid groups in fall samples 2-4 years alter logging. Overall, the project demonstrated and explored ecological linkages between boreal forest streams and their adjacent terrestrial environment by disturbing the riparian and upland forests and measuring responses in streams. Land/water linkages between forest streams and their catchments have been explored extensively before, but very few studies of this nature have occurred in the boreal forest, especially on the Boreal Shield. Significant year-to-year fluctuations among our various response measurements across experimental sites and the significant differen es among the comparative sites indicated that catchment-wide influences (i.e., upland logging, interannual climate conditions, watershed runoff) had a greater bearing on litter decomposition and invertebrate community structure than the reach-level disturbance created by riparian logging. Partial harvesting at up to 50% tree removal (10-30% average removal but up to 50% at any one spot) in riparian buffers of boreal forest streams is not likely to adversely affect over-stream canopy cover, solar radiation inputs, temperature patterns, sediment deposition rates, leaf litter decomposition or associated aquatic invertebrate communities. This novel riparian harvesting approach could be a viable riparian management strategy for boreal forest streams. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - There are conflicting reports in the literature concerning vegetated filter strips (VFS) and the contribution of a sorption mechanism to herbicide trapping efficiency (TE). Moreover, adsorption, desorption, and mineralization of herbicide metabolites in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) have not been evaluated. Yet, these data are needed to predict the transport of these compounds through VFSS. To address the contribution of herbicide mass adsorbed (M as ) to TE, simulated runon experiments were conducted to compare TE and Mas among metolachlor, metolachlor oxanilic acid (OA), and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (ESA) in buffalograss filter strips. Subsequently, the potential transport of these compounds was assessed in laboratory experiments where adsorption, desorption, and mineralization parameters were compared between a cultivated Houston Black clay (CS) and an adjacent VFS established in a mixed stand of bermudagrass and buffalograss. Parallel field and laboratory experiments were conducted with atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), diaminoatrazine (DA), and hydroxyatrazine (HA). In the field experiment, TE was greater for metolachlor (25.3%) compared to OA (15.5%) and ESA (14.2%). Significantly more metolachlor (17.3%) was retained as Mas compared to either metabolite (≤7.0%). An identical trend was observed in the atrazine study. These data demonstrate that sorption to the VFS sorbents (grass, grass thatch, and/or soil surface) is an important retention mechanism. Retention differences among compounds were attributed to hydrophobic interactions among the compounds and the VFS sorbents. In the laboratory experiments, organic carbon content, microbial activity, microbial numbers, and soil enzymatic activity were higher in the VFSS compared to the adjacent CS. Sorption and mineralization data for metolachlor, ESA, and OA indicate that the transport of these compounds is reduced in the VFSS. In contrast, our sorption and mineralization data for atrazine, DEA, and HA demonstrate that the transport of these compounds may not be reduced in the VFSS. However, the potential transport of DIA is lower in the VFSS.

AB  - Riparian zones have come to be recognized as providers of critical ecosystem functions in watersheds, namely water pollution mitigation, erosion and flood control, wildlife habitat, carbon storage, recreation and aesthetics. Relatively few studies have focused on riparian systems in the northeastern United States where habitat degradation has been severe since settlement. The drainage of the Conestoga River in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania was selected for study, as this intensely farmed area is an extreme case in which very erodable soils and inadequate riparian buffers have resulted in the transport of remarkable loads of silt and agricultural enrichment into the watershed. Conservation of limited streamside forests and creation of new ones is vital for the region. This study focuses on four areas of streamside forest ecology: (1) The impacts of past land use from presettlement to the present, (2) The composition of the present community and changes that have occurred over the last ten years, (3) The effects of climate on the growth of nine common riparian species, comparing growth responses of trees at streamside with that of trees at a distance from the stream, and (4) The effects of floods on the woody riparian community. Information on the presettlement forest was obtained from witness trees recorded in the early 18th century metes and bounds land surveys. Dramatic changes were seen when comparing the early forest inferred from the witness trees with the modern streamside forest. At settlement, the Lancaster County streamside forests were dominated by Quercus alba, Q. velutina and Carya , spp. Today Quercus alba and Q. velutina combined make up only 2% of the community in the same area. The forest is now dominated by early successional species, namely Acer negundo, A. saccharinum, Platanus occidentalis and Fraxinus pennsylvanica . To determine the composition and structure of the modern forest, 46 sampling locations were established throughout the Conestoga River drainage to include, where possible, all tributaries and all existing stream classes. Over 8000 trees were included in the study. Two distinct streamside communities were identified, associated with the two contrasting physiographic provinces in the study area. The more species rich northern community, an environment of first and second order streams, was dominated by Acer rubrum, F. pennsylvanica, Liriodendron tulipifera and P. occidentalis , with the late successional species Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia occurring prominently in the understory. P. occidentalis, A negundo, A. saccharinum and F. pennsylvanica dominate the southern community along the mainstem of the lower Conestoga River and lower reaches of the major tributaries. The effects of severe flooding limit this community to early successional and flood resistor species. Radial growth of nine common tree species was evaluated using a dendroclimatological approach, comparing growth responses in the streamside and contiguous upland environment for each species. Radial growth was correlated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and temperature and precipitation separately. Three guilds of trees emerged in the streamside environment: L. tulipifera and F. pennsylvanica correlated positively with climate variables (grew best in wet and warm conditions); P. occidentalis, A. saccharum, A. saccharinum, A. negundo and Ailanthus altissima correlated negatively (grew best during the worst droughts); and A. rubrum and Celtis occidentalis showed weak and mixed correlations. These correlations were usually not seen with these species in the upland environments. The lower Conestoga River drainage is a region shaped by an extreme historical event, the Hurricane Agnes flood of 1972. Seven sites were selected in the lower drainage to represent a range of potential flood velocities, inferred from channel morphology. Tree core analysis revealed that most of the trees in the floodplain of the hi hest velocity sites dated to Agnes event. In the lowest velocity site no evidence of this establishment pulse was seen. There is a gradient in between. A major release event is documented in the tree ring records of those trees that established prior to 1970 and survived the flood. Patterns seen in this study can be applied to other systems to infer flood histories and stand dynamics in the absence of hydrological records.

AB  - In order to understand the dynamics of stream water nitrate-N flux, a small agricultural watershed was monitored throughout the year, along a spatial gradient, and in response to specific storm events. Seven sampling locations along the Bear Creek watershed were monitored for nitrate-N concentration. Event based samples were taken at a site mid-watershed next to an instrumented weir in order to assess the NO 3- -N concentration response during a storm event. A stage-discharge rating curve was developed in order to quantify NO3- -N flux. Nitrate-N concentrations were relatively high during the study period and would have exceeded the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg L-1 for drinking water at a majority of the sites throughout the year. The headwater of West Bear Creek (a tributary of Bear Creek) was over the MCL 89% of the time, which was the highest for any of the seven sites. The furthest downstream site, was over the MCL the least amount of time of any site, but was still higher than 10 mg L-1 47% of the time. There was a general trend of decreasing NO 3 - -N concentration from the headwaters to the outlet of Bear Creek. A spatial gradient was more profound during the spring and fall months, which was attributed to the effects of subsurface drainage. Spring consistently had the highest NO3- -N concentrations of all the seasons for each of the sampling sites. NO3- -N concentrations were the lowest during the summer months when subsurface drainage was limited and conditions are ideal for in-stream processing. Event samples showed that there was a lag between peak NO3- -N concentrations and the peak in the hydrograph. Sediment delivery models based on plot studies have been developed to predict watershed sediment yield. The modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) predicts sediment yield applicable to individual storm events. A major limitation to the MUSLE is that it does not take into account the effects of concentrated flow leading to ephemeral gully (EG) erosion. The formation of an EG provides a direct link from the uplands to the streams which increases sediment delivered from sheet and rill flow by reducing the surface roughness. Two study sites were located on the Southern Iowa Drift Plain ecoregion to quantify the amount of sediment loss in small catchments with ephemeral gullies. The observed amount of sediment loss was then compared to the MUSLE predicted amount of sediment loss for each individual storm event. The disparity among the predicted and observed sediment yields increased with storm size. A general weakness with the MUSLE is that rainfall events are based on a 24 hour rainfall depth and not intensity which is a dominant factor in how much rainfall will result in runoff. Riparian buffers have been accepted as an edge of field best management practice to improve surface water quality by reducing the sediment and nutrients transported in surface runoff. Many plot scale studies under uniform flow conditions have assessed the effectiveness of various riparian buffers at mitigating the effects of concentrated flow. The purpose of this study was to examine, at the hillslope scale and natural rainfall conditions, the impact that concentrated flow has on edge of field practices. The study was conducted on two private farms located in the Lake Darling and Lake Rathbun watersheds located in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain physiographic region. The three sites located in the Lake Rathbun watershed consisted of one control, located at the crop field/buffer interface, and two sites with a 15.2 m wide grass filter treatment. The three sites located in the Lake Darling watershed consisted of one control, located at the crop field/buffer interface, and two sites with a 15.2 m wide natural riparian forest buffer. Potential pollutants monitored were total sediment, nitrate-N, ortho-P, total-N, and total-P. The grass filter strips reduced pollutant load relative to the control at the field edge in smaller rain events. However, one of the grass filter sites was not effective at reducing pollu ant load during larger events. There appears to be a threshold that is dependent upon the amount and intensity of rain, and the contributing area to effective buffer ratio. The riparian forests were less predictable for which storm events they can be considered effective. This is because there is little to no resistance to concentrated flow within the riparian forest, as concentrated flow forms a classic gully within the buffer. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Agroforestry buffers, a system of land use in which harvestable trees or shrubs are grown among or around crops or on pastureland, have been proposed for improving water quality in watersheds. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate saturated hydraulic conductivity ( Ksat ) and water retention for soils managed under rotationally-grazed pasture (RG), continuously grazed pasture (CG), grass buffers (GB), and agroforestry buffers (AgB); (ii) to compare differences in computed tomography (CT)-measured macropore (>1000-μm diam.) and coarse mesopore (200- to 1000-μm diam.) parameters for AgB, GB, RG and CG treatments, and to examine relationships between CT-measured pore parameters and Ksat ; (iii) to compare the influence of AgB and GB systems under rotationally stocked (RG) and continuously stocked (CG) pasture systems on water infiltration measured using ponded infiltration and tension infiltration methods; (iv) to evaluate differences in root length density (RLD) and root and soil carbon content within GB, AgB, RG and CG treatments; and (v) to model runoff and sediment losses for grazed pasture watersheds with and without AgB buffers. Pasture and GB areas included red clover ( Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. Soil bulk density was 12.6% higher for the pasture treatments compared to buffer treatments. Soil water content at high soil water potentials (0 and -0.4 kPa) was greater in the buffer treatments relative to pasture treatments for the 0-10 cm soil depth. Soil macroporosity (>1000 μm diam.) was 5.7, 4.5, and 3.9 times higher, respectively, for the AgB, GB, and RG treatments compared to the CG treatment for the 0-10 cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater macroporosity (>1000-μm diam.), coarse (60- to 1000-μm diam.) and fine mesoporosity (10 to 60 μm diam.) but lower microporosity (< 10 μm diam.) compared to pasture treatments. The Ksat for the buffer treatments was 16.7 times higher compared with pasture treatments. The CT-measured soil macroporosity was 13 times higher (0.053 m3 m -3 ) for the buffer treatments compared to the pasture treatments (0.004 m3m-3) for the surface 0-10 cm soil depth. Buffer treatments had greater CT-measured macroporosity (0.019 m3 m-3 ) compared to pasture (0.0045 m3 m-3 ) treatments. The CT-measured pore parameters (except macropore circularity) were positively correlated with Ksat . Quasi-steady state infiltration rates (qs ) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs ) for buffers were about 30 and 40 times higher compared to pasture treatments, respectively. Green-Ampt and Parlange models appeared to fit measured data with r2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.98. The infiltration rate in 2007 for the GB treatment was the highest (221 mm h-1 ) and for the CG treatment was the lowest (3.7 mm h-1 ). Estimated sorptivity ( S ) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks ) parameters were higher for buffer areas compared to the stocked pasture areas. Grazing reduced the infiltration rate for the pasture treatments. Buffer treatments had 4.5 times higher RLD as compared to pasture treatments. The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm 3 ) and CG had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm3 ) RLD. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. This study illustrates that agroforestry and grass buffers maintained higher values for soil hydraulic properties compared to grazed pasture systems. The CT-study illustrates the benefits of agroforestry and grass buffers for maintaining soil pore parameters critical for soil water transport. Results from the infiltration study conclude that the buffer areas have higher infiltration rates which imply lower runoff compared to pasture areas. The root study implies that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers on grazed pasture watersheds improves soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties, thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape. Results of these studies indicate that establishment of agroforestry and grass buffers on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil hydraulic properties, pore parameters, soil carbon sequestration and water quality indices and thus contribute to enhance overall environmental quality.

AB  - Deteriorating surface water quality due, in part, to nitrogen from nonpoint sources has fueled much interest in solutions to these problems. To meet North Carolina mandates of reducing nitrogen loads in selected rivers by 30% over a five-year period, scientists proposed guidelines to meet this goal. Riparian buffers and controlled drainage are two Best Management Practices (BMPs) than have been shown to reduce the amount of nitrogen entering surface and subsurface waters as a result of denitrification, but they are not always effective or practical on all landscapes. In 1998, a project to study the effect of using riparian buffers in conjunction with controlled drainage was initiated. Soil redox potential is an indicator that provides evidence as to whether or not conditions are favorable for denitrification. Four riparian buffers at widths of 7.6 or 15.2 m, with five vegetative treatments (fescue, switch grass, pine trees, field crop, and native vegetation), were established. Groundwater monitoring wells, at three depths, were installed at the edge of the ditch, the field edge, and in the field in each treatment. A water control structure was installed at the mouth of one of the ditches. A total of 176 redox electrodes were inserted to 76 cm or 152 cm at the ditch and field edges of the riparian buffers. By raising the water table with controlled drainage, conditions favoring denitrification were enhanced. Results from this one-year study show that buffers with controlled drainage at a depth of 152 cm had low redox values favorable for denitrification and subsequently lower nitrate concentrations in the groundwater as compared to areas with buffers, but no control.

AB  - In managed forests, riparian buffer strips are maintained primarily to protect water quality. They are also thought to safeguard diverse plant and animal communities. The value of buffer strips to area-dependent and edge-sensitive forest songbirds, however, is largely unknown. Numbers of one such species, the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), have declined in narrow buffers following upland timber harvest I assessed the conservation potential of riparian buffer strips for Ovenbirds in Alberta's boreal mixed-wood forest. I measured abundance, territory characteristics, and pairing success in 20m, 100m, and 200m buffers, one year before and one year after upland clearcutting. Following timber harvest, Ovenbirds were absent from 20m buffer strips. Harvesting did not influence abundance, territory size, or pairing success in 100m or 200m buffers. Territories narrowed in both 100m and 200m buffers, though the response was significant only in the latter. Post-harvest territory position did not change in 200m buffers, but territories in 100m strips shifted lakeward, including more habitat adjacent to the riparian edge than before harvest. This positional adjustment may have resulted in changes to the structure of Ovenbird habitat. Further research is necessary to determine whether short-term results reflect long-term effects.

AB  - Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, has become an important agricultural pest in the Midwestern United States. Here I present a study that identifies the parasitoid natural enemy community of the soybean aphid and the role non-crop habitat near soybean plays in attracting parasitoids to attack the aphid. The parasitoid community consists of Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson), Binodoxys kelloggensis Pike, Starý, & Brewer, Aphelinus albipodus (Hayat & Fatima), Aphelinus asychis (Walker), Aphidius colemani Viereck, Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh), and Praon sp. Lysiphlebus testaceipes was found abundantly attacking soybean aphids in soybean fields rather than aphids in adjacent non-cropped habitat. However, B. kelloggensis apparently did not discriminate between habitats when foraging for hosts. I measured plant diversity within three non-cropped habitat treatments and compared plant diversity with parasitoid recoveries. Lysiphlebus testaceipes responded positively to increasing plant diversity in treatments mowed twice per month; B. kelloggensis showed a similarly positive relationship with increasing plant diversity, but within treatments mowed once at the beginning of the study. The simple farm practice of mowing field borders is not sufficient to aid in parasitoid transition to use soybean aphid in soybean, but the role of non-cropped habitat to attract parasitoids to soybean aphid is clarified when plant diversity of the field border is added to the analysis.

AB  - Over the past three decades, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has led to the conversion of millions of environmentally sensitive farmlands to grasslands, as well as the implementation of vegetative buffers (VBS) to prevent agrochemicals from entering water systems. The CRP has demonstrated through site-specific studies that it is effective in reducing contaminants in surface waters. However, the ability to successfully assess the impacts of the program on water quality at the watershed level requires techniques that can detect VBS and conservation grasslands. The areas and locations of these practices can then be used in hydrologic models to understand their functionality in the environment. This study assessed the impacts of conservation buffers and grasslands on discharge and Total Phosphorus (TP) loads using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with land cover data developed from an Object- Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach along with different precipitation datasets from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory (NSERL), and the Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) in the St. Joseph River Watershed (SJRW) and the Cedar Creek Watershed (CCW) located in northeast Indiana. The OBIA land cover data showed greater than 50% of the stream area consisted of VBS of 30.5 m and 61.0 m widths. Comparison of the conservation grasslands identified by the OBIA with those reported in the Common Land Unit (CLU) inventory for the year 2005 showed the area depicted by the OBIA was less than reported by the CLU. A comparison of the radar-derived precipitation and rain gauge precipitation showed that increased rain gauge density reduced the overall bias by 3.3% for data collected between 2005 and 2008. To gain a greater understanding of how different precipitation datasets affect the hydrology of the watershed, simulated streamflow values from NSERL+NCDC, NEXRAD precipitation datasets were compared with that generated using the NCDC data alone. SWAT simulated discharge with NEXRAD-derived precipitation data under-estimated the observed streamflow, while discharge simulated from the rain gauge over-estimated the observed streamflow. Calibration of the model with each precipitation dataset increased model efficiency and decreased the bias in the simulated streamflow. Although the results showed that simulated discharge with the NCDC+NSERL showed less bias, either precipitation dataset can be a valuable input for hydrological processes simulation. The NCDC+NSERL precipitation dataset was used in SWAT combined with the OBIA land cover to assess the impact of conservation buffers and grasslands on TP loads. All land cover categories were considered to define the Hydrologic Response Units such that small vegetation patches would be represented in the model.The model was run with and without conservation grasslands, VBS of 30.5 m and 61.0 m. It was found that greater than 7.0% of the TP load reduction was achieved with all the practices combined, while VBS of 61.0 m alone decreased the TP load by more than 3.0%. Furthermore, the combination of these practices with the SWAT edge-of-field buffer module achieved more that 30% reduction of TP loads. This research provides a better means of monitoring existing programs and developing more effective management strategies that can considerably reduce nutrient inputs into water systems. Because the OBIA rules can be applied to different image acquisition dates, it should help policy makers and natural resource managers to rapidly quantify areas under the vegetative buffers and conservation grasslands or other similar conservation practices. This information can then be used to assess their impact on the environment.

AB  - Tallgrass prairie evolved with fire-grazer interactions. Fire and grazing are vital processes for maintaining grasslands and cattle production, and therefore will be continued as land management schemes. The effects of fire and grazers on prairie streams are understudied, but may significantly influence stream ecology. This dissertation examined how prescribed burning, bison grazing, and patch-burn grazing (by cattle) influence water quality, stream biota, and riparian amphibians and reptiles at Konza Prairie, Kansas, or Osage Prairie, Missouri. Using Global Positioning System, we monitored bison and cattle distribution throughout watersheds. The immediate effects of prescribed burning were examined at both Konza and Osage Prairies. The impacts of bison on water quality were determined by using a long-term dataset from Konza Prairie and compared watersheds with and without bison. Amphibian and reptile assemblages were monitored for two years at Osage, and assemblage data were analyzed using redundancy analysis, permuted analysis of variance, and occupancy modeling. A patch-burn grazing experiment occurred for 5 years at Osage (2 years pretreatment data and 3 years of treatments) and was analyzed using a before-after, control-impact design. Prescribed burning had minimal effects on water chemistry. At Konza Prairie, bison did not alter water quality likely because they spent negligible time (<5%) in streams. Contrarily, cattle at Osage Prairie significantly increased stream concentrations of total suspended solids, nutrients, Escherichia coli bacteria, algal biomass, and primary production. Unlike bison, cattle spent significant time (∼21%) in streams if allowed access to riparian zones. In watersheds with cattle excluded from streams by riparian fencing, water quality contaminant concentrations increased significantly, but not to the magnitude of unfenced streams. Amphibian abundance and richness were not different among patch types; instead, they were restricted to specific basins. However, reptiles displayed preference for certain patch-types, and had the highest abundance and richness in watersheds with fire and grazing. These results have implications for natural resource management. Riparian fencing of cattle may be a useful practice in areas where water resource protection is the priority. However, overland flow may alter water quality in watersheds with grazers despite fencing. Land managers will need to define management objectives and accept trade-offs in water quality, amphibian and reptile habitat, and cattle production.

AB  - Stream restoration projects that attempt to reduce channel incision and bank erosion by reconstructing the channel and grading and armoring stream banks (channel stability restoration projects) are common, particularly in urbanized watersheds. However, integrated assessment of changes in geomorphic processes and ecological properties within the channel and in the surrounding riparian zone induced by stability restoration has rarely been carried out across multiple restored streams. I provide such an assessment by measuring channel complexity, bed sediment dynamics, channel movement rates, riparian soil structure and function, and diatom communities in multiple restored streams located in urbanized watersheds and comparing these measurements to measurements from urban and forested reference streams. Stability restoration appears to have reduced lateral channel migration and channel incision through channel reshaping. Patterns of bed sediment movement were altered through the effects of added channel obstructions on flow dynamics and bed sediment size distribution. Channel stability restoration did not alter channel complexity, primarily because channel complexity was not reduced by urbanization as has commonly been assumed. Restoration did not alter diatom communities either, primarily because diatom communities responded more strongly to urbanization-induced changes in water chemistry. Riparian soils were negatively impacted by stability restoration, particularly compared to riparian buffer establishment, which had mostly neutral effects on riparian soils. Channel stability restoration can provide a minor increase in channel and bed sediment stability. However, changes in bed sediment stability were driven by in-channel restoration structures, which can be placed without grading the banks or reconstructing the channel. Riparian buffer restoration can also stabilize channels and will provide wood to channels, which can provide similar stabilization benefits as restoration structures. Restoration of channel stability using only in-channel structures and riparian vegetation planting would reduce the cost of stability restoration and reduce negative impacts to riparian soils. Even so, effects of stability restoration were often overwhelmed by processes operating beyond the channel boundaries, suggesting that reach-scale targeting of channel instability needs to be assessed at the watershed scale and may need to be given lower priority to such restoration approaches as stormwater management, which directly address the causes of channel instability.

AB  - I studied the population ecology of the flightless, forest-dwelling carabid beetle Scaphinotus angusticollis Fischer Von Waldheim (O. Coleoptera F. Carabidae) and several aspects of its body condition for their associations with forest harvesting. Comparison of population estimates revealed that catch-per-unit-effort estimates were not significantly different from more detailed analyses. In two years of trapping, S. angusticollis population densities were found to be significantly lower in clearcuts, as compared to 30 m riparian reserves and uncut forest, suggesting that riparian buffers provide adequate habitat to maintain populations of this terrestrial insect. Movement of S. angusticollis differed in the three habitats studied between years and treatments, with the greatest movement occurring in 30 m buffers in one year and in control sites the next. Clearcuts had the lowest amount of movement in both years. One of the known prey species for S. angusticollis , snails < 2 cm in diameter, were more abundant in clearcut habitat, with Ancotrema hybridum the most abundant species. Canonical correspondence analysis suggests that only A. hybridum were positively correlated with plant cover, and that other species abundances may rely on coarse, downed wood as cover. Thus only some species of snails are associated with recently logged areas. The internal body conditions of S. angusticollis living in clearcut, 30 m buffer and uncut sites showed that gut fullness was significantly correlated with energy storage (fat body) and habitat types (clearcut, 30 m buffer and uncut). This study demonstrates how some forest insects, particularly ground beetles, are affected by harvesting and that current management practices on the stand scale can mitigate some of the negative impacts of logging.

AB  - An investigation of endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus ) ecology led to development of a Geodata Crawler with applications in eco-hydrology. Geodata Crawler includes a national GIS (geospatial information systems) database with layers that quantify climate, land cover, soils, human development, and other attributes of the biosphere. For user-locations in the continental United States, Geodata Crawler can rapidly tabulate site-specific statistics within automatically delineated sample areas: points, site radii, watersheds, and riparian zones, among others. Geodata Crawler supported a multi-scale analysis of N. americanus habitat at a military installation in western Arkansas to produce a Landsat-based monitoring tool. Royle's N-mixture model was used to simultaneously account for 1) the detection process associated with baited pitfall traps, and 2) the ecological processes driving spatial patterns of abundance. Detection rates of N. americanus averaged 20% and were optimized at about 29° C on nights with high humidity and slight wind. Effective sample radii assessed using marked beetles released at known locations were no more than 800 m, and detection rates dropped below 5% beyond 400 m. Nicrophorus americanus abundance was associated with native grasslands and open-canopy oak woodlands with rolling topography, sandy loam soils, and moderate disturbances from wildfire. Habitat measured within 800 m site radii produced best fitting models compared to 100 or 1600 m radii. A new above-ground bucket trap was evaluated in comparison to standard pitfall traps. Compared to standard pitfall traps, above-ground bucket traps were safer for beetles, more resistant to scavengers, and more time-efficient for workers to install. The first application of Geodata Crawler for aquatic ecology was an eco-hydrology project that identified seven natural flow regimes of the Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands based on daily hydrological data from 64 reference streams. Geodata Crawler quantified climate and catchment characteristics necessary to predict natural flow regimes of 24,557 un-gaged stream segments. This dissertation demonstrated the utility of Geodata Crawler for eco-hydrology and species distribution modeling. Development will continue to expand potential applications to include landscape genetics and climate change, and also to support web-based project submission, cluster computing, and FTP-based data retrieval.

AB  - Inga spp are tropical legume trees traditionally used for shade in coffee and cacao plantations and have potential for hedgerows in alley-cropping practices. Little information can be found concerning the N2 -fixation of these species. The rhizobia that nodulate Inga edulis Mart was characterized using standard laboratory procedures and DNA analysis. Dinitrogen fixation of I. edulis was determined by the 15 N isotope dilution technique. Mathematical models were used to evaluate the rate of decomposition and N release of I. edulis and I. samanensis Uribe leaves. The production of green mulch and firewood of I. edulis and I. samanensis were evaluated in an organic-corn alley-cropping practice in the humid tropics. Inga edulis is nodulated by a fast growing Bradyrhizobium sp. and is a N2 -fixing tree. Inga edulis and I. samanensis produced similar amounts of mulch, N content in the mulch, and firewood. Inga samanensis leaves decomposed faster and released more N than I. edulis leaves, but this difference in N release did not affect the corn yield. In 2001, corn yield in the monocrop was higher than in the alley cropping, but was equal in 2002. Inga edulis and I. samanensis had similar characteristics and showed to be well situated for organic-corn alley cropping in the humid tropics.

AB  - Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from agricultural areas is one of the most critical problems threatening the nation's water resources. Surface runoff is a major carrier of NPS pollutants. Riparian buffers have been proposed as a means of reducing transport of NPS pollutants from agricultural areas to streams. Using rainfall simulation techniques and natural runoff monitoring, plot studies were conducted to evaluate the ability of an established multi-species riparian buffer system to reduce sediment and nutrient in agricultural runoff. The buffer system evaluated contained three types of vegetation: cool-season grasses, warm-season grasses, and woody plants. Results indicated that the effectiveness of the riparian buffer was determined by the characteristics of the pollutants, buffer width, vegetation type, and permeability of the buffer soil. Under the simulated rainfall and runoff condition, the 6 m wide grass buffers removed 77% of the incoming sediment from surface runoff while the 3 m wide buffers removed 66%. Differences between 6 m and 3 m wide buffers were significant ( P < 0.05) for sediment and nutrient removal. A warm-season grass buffer composed of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. cv. Cave-n-Rock) was more effective in reducing transport of sediment, total-N, NO3 -N, total-P and PO4 -P in runoff compared to a cool-season grass buffer. Under natural rainfall conditions, the 7.1 m wide warm-season grass (switchgrass) buffer removed 95% of sediment, 80% of total-N, 62% of NO3-N, 78% of total-P, and 58% of PO4 -P in surface runoff. The 16.3 m wide warm-season grass/woody buffer removed 97% of sediment, 94% of total-N, 85% of NO3 -N, 91% of total-P, and 80% of PO4 -P in runoff. Clay and soluble nutrient reduction were related to the degree of runoff infiltration. Even though the warm-season grass buffer was effective at removing sediment and sediment-bound nutrients, the warm-season grass/woody buffer increased the removal efficiency of soluble nutrients by over 20%. The combination of dense, stiff, warm-season grasses, and woody vegetation in a riparian buffer system improves the removal of NPS pollutants from agricultural runoff. These results can be used to improve the design of riparian buffers for improved water quality in agricultural areas.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) can reduce the level of pollutants and contaminants carried in runoff from upland sites. The research determined the relative effectiveness of ten forage and turfgrass species in reducing the movement of nitrate nitrogen from the plant root zone below a VFS. The species tested were: Lolium perenne, Poa pratensis, Festuca arundinacea, Alopecurus arundinaceus, Anthoxanthum ordoratum, Phalaris arundinacea, Dactylis glomerata, Bromus inermis, Panicum virgatum, and Andropogon gerardi. Nitrogen (177 kg ha$\sp{-1}$) as urea was applied during the seedling year (1988) then 100 and 226 kg ha$\sp{-1}$ in the two subsequent years. Forage was harvested three times in 1989 and twice in 1990. Two year forage yield ranged from 10.8 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for Dactylis to 4.7 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for Lolium. The vegetation removal accounted for only 15% for Panicum of the amount nitrogen applied and 42% for Bromus. Total nitrogen harvested in the grass forage ranged from 53 kg ha$\sp{-1}$ for Andropogon to 137 kg ha$\sp{-1}$ for Bromus. Ceramic lysimeter plates were installed below the root zone to collect percolate. Percolate water samples generated by 78 rainfall, snowmelt, and soil thaw events were collected and analyzed for nitrate N. Twenty-six month average nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 mg L$\sp{-1}$ to 10.8 mg L$\sp{-1}$ for the percolate under the ten species. Dactylis, Festuca, and Anthoxanthum produced leachate nitrate concentrations below 2.0 mg L$\sp{-1}$. Mass nitrate N loading was 24-fold higher for Panicum than Dactylis (5.5 vs 130.3 kg ha$\sp{-1}$). Plant material selection is an important design criteria of a vegetated filter strip to ensure the highest efficiency of removing entrapped nitrogen in the VFS.

AB  - Using data from five years of field experiments, we assessed the influence of insecticidal transgenic crop technologies on non-target epigeal insect diversity in both maize and diversified vegetable agroecosystems. Concurrently, we considered the relative influence of crop species, crop rotations, and proximity to forested field margins on these insect communities. Our approach differed from other transgenic non-target studies by emphasizing species-level identification of a functionally diverse subset of the epigeal insect community, notably Coleoptera, with extensive analysis of Carabidae, to maximize the biological and functional resolution of the data. We examined population dynamics as well as community response using current statistical approaches in the fields of biodiversity sciences and community ecology. Insecticide inputs were lower in transgenic crops due to the efficient control of important pest taxa, which served to sustain epigeal biodiversity. In maize agroecosystems, no differences were found between the coleopteran communities in conventional and transgenic insect control practices where transgenic field corn contained a neonicotinoid seed treatment. Both management tactics negatively influenced coleopeteran communities compared to a control. Dominant members of the carabid community exhibited temporal partitioning of resources. One species, Harpalus pensylvanicus , consistently exhibited higher activity-densities in the control fields, and was identified as a possible bio-indicator. Despite management influences, differences between crop species and the effect of crop rotations was often sufficient to mask any treatment effects. Carabid communities were significantly different between maize and a forested field margin, and shifts in community structure along a transect were most rapid at the grassy margin between the two habitats. Carabidae communities were more diverse in the forest edge, where plant diversity was also highest. Despite strong habitat associations, most abundant carabids were found in both forest and maize. Differences between carabid communities in maize fields at varying distances from a forested margin suggested landscape level influences. In conclusion, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of agroecosystems in the northeastern U.S. seemed to promote on-farm insect diversity, although non-target effects from transgenics coupled with neonicotinoid seed treatments and conventional insect control methods were discernible from a control.

AB  - Logging pressures on boreal forests have increased in recent decades and carry with them increased concerns for wildlife and habitat conservation. Buffer strips mitigate some of the negative impacts of logging on riparian habitat and associated wildlife. Given the widespread use of buffer strips, the subsequent increase of clear-cut/forest edge, and the decline of many forest birds, I investigated how buffer strips and habitat edges influence avian nesting success. Nest predation is the most common cause of nest failure among song birds. Therefore, artificial nests are a useful research tool for investigating the influences of habitat alteration on nest predation. Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs are often used in artificial nest studies, although these eggs may be too large to detect predation by small mammals. My primary objectives were to determine (1) if nest predation differs between intact riparian forest and (a) buffer strips and (b) clear-cut forest edges, and (2) if Japanese Quail eggs are appropriate to use in artificial nest studies in western Newfoundland.

AB  - Well-designed, multi-species riparian buffer strips are recognized as one of the most cost-effective bioremediation approaches to alleviating nonpoint sources of agricultural pollutants from croplands. Thirty-six, 1 m wide and 0.5 m deep, fluorinated lysimeters with six different ground covers (bare ground, orchardgrass, tall fescue, timothy, smooth bromegrass, and switchgrass) were established in 1998 to evaluate the effect of forages on the fate and transport of atrazine (ATR), Balance (isoxalflutole; IXF) and nitrate. Concentrations of ATR, Balance and their metabolites in the leachate, soil and plant tissues were determined by solid phase or liquid-liquid extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography UV spectroscopy (HPLC-UV), HPLC mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), HPLC tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), or gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The results suggested that the total Balance (parent + metabolites) showed higher mobility than the atrazine and its metabolites. Differences in the timing of transport reflect the rapid degradation of IXF to the more soluble, stable and biologically active diketonitrile (DKN) metabolite in the system. Grass treatments significantly enhanced ATR degradation in the leachates and soils, especially through N-dealkylation reaction, but they did not reduce total ATR present in the leachates. Among the forage-treated lysimeters, the greatest ATR degradation was found in switchgrass-treated (80.7%), timothy-treated (74.7%) and smooth bromegrass-treated (72.2%) soils. In contrast, grass treatments did not promote the hydrolysis of DKN in soils and leachates, but they significantly reduced the total quantity in the leachates through enhanced evapotranspiration. The degradation of DKN appears to be an abiotic process under the conditions tested in this study. Switchgrass, smooth bromegass and tall fescue exhibited the highest microbial denitrification capacity and could remove up to 99.7% of nitrate from leachates and 91.2% of nitrate from the lysimeter soils. For ATR-treated forages, growth inhibition of each forage coincided with its hydroxylation capacity. For Balance-treated grasses, growth inhibition is strongly associated with their capacity to convert DKN to a nonphytotoxic benzoic acid metabolite. In a bioremediation system utilizing the forages tested here, the enhanced biological degradation by the forage will play an essential role in the removal of ATR. On the other hand, the apparent abiotic nature of DKN degradation in the soil implies that physical trapping is likely to be the primary remediation mechanism for Balance removal. Based on this lysimeter study, switchgrass, tall fescue and smooth bromegrass are good candidates for incorporation in multi-species riparian buffer practices designed for the bioremediation of ATR, Balance and nitrate.

AB  - Existing stresses of fragmentation on plant diversity and range dynamics will be exacerbated by climatic changes that shift bioclimatic regions northward. It is often stated that connectivity-enhancement through the establishment of corridors could facilitate the movement and conservation of plants, providing a timescale of dispersal and establishment relevant to rapid bioclimatic change. We tested this hypothesis focusing on forest herbaceous species dispersing through agroecosystems in southern Quebec using regenerating hedgerow-corridors. Most species (n= 31 of 42) recorded in regional forests were also found in hedgerows, though species rates of dispersal through hedgerows, recorded at ≤ 2.50 m year -1 , indicate corridors would not benefit the dispersal of these species in rapidly changing conditions. Forest species tend to reassemble in corridors with time, but our results suggest that establishing connectivity would only conserve agroecosystem plant diversity at long timescales; dispersal limitations and possibly environmental conditions represent a severe barrier for most species. Keywords: plant diversity, ecological corridor, climate change, fragmented landscape, connectivity, dispersal, conservation.

AB  - It is widely recognized that many agricultural watersheds are contaminated by nutrients and sediments. However, land-use change in the riparian corridor can be a viable option in mitigating the non-point source pollution. On the other hand, the water quality management strategy will be successful only if it is economically feasible. The research focus of this dissertation is to quantify the ecological and economical impacts of land-use changes in riparian buffer zones on the hydrology and water quality in the Little Miami River watershed, Ohio, through creation and application of an integrated modeling approach. The ArcView GIS based U.S. EPA BASINS/HSPF model was calibrated and validated from 1980-1993 using local DEM, climatic, land-use, flow, and water quality data. The replacement cost method was used to estimate the value of riparian forest buffer zones based on the cost of nitrogen and phosphorus removal through wastewater treatment plants. Results indicated that the 60-meter, 90-meter and 120-meter riparian forest and wetland buffers were able to reduce the mean annual flow by 0.26%-0.28%, mean annual nitrite plus nitrate by 2.9%-6.1%, and mean annual total phosphorus by 3.2%-7.8%. It was also found that three engineering best management practices (BMPs) in the agricultural land, 25% filter strips, 50% filter strips, and 25% grassed swales, could achieve similar or better nutrient mitigation results than the riparian buffers. The economic valuation showed that for the 60-meter, 90-meter and 120-meter riparian forest buffers, the benefit:cost ratios were the same, 0.269:1. The highest benefit:cost ratio, 0.348:1, was from 50% filter strips. Although none of them was cost effective, compared with two selected engineering BMPs, the 60-meter forest buffers had the highest benefit:cost ratio among three riparian forest buffer designs. This dissertation has demonstrated that the BASINS/HSPF is a very reliable and useful water quality and quantity assessment tool, and the replacement cost valuation method is able to effectively estimate both the costs and benefits of riparian land-use changes.

AB  - Multispecies riparian buffers (MRBs) are a conservation practice that protects water quality and prevents soil erosion by improving soil quality including aggregate stability, particulate organic matter (POM), and water infiltration. USDA Conservation Reserve Program MRB contracts last 10-15 years; evidence shows MRB soil quality may improve within 3-7 years, but there is little data on how MRB soils perform after contracts typically expire. Slaked soil aggregate stability was measured in a 20-21 year-old MRB in central Iowa at the surface (0-15 cm) and used to calculate the indices mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), and percent water-stable macroaggregates (%WSA). The MRB contained zones of switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L. 'Cave-in-Rock'), hybrid poplar ( Populus spp. ), and cool-season grass; results were compared with an adjacent crop field, a formerly grazed pasture, and a natural riparian forest. Bulk density, total soil carbon, and POM were also measured. A Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer was used to measure infiltration in a 10-year old tree and cool-season grass MRB, and in the switchgrass, cool-season grass and silver maple zones of the MRB used in the soil aggregate study. MRBs were compared with trafficked and non-trafficked crop interrows in a nearby crop field. Perennial vegetation had greater MWD, GMD, %WSA, and total SOC compared to the crop field. Data collected in 1997 showed no significant differences in %WSA or MWD between switchgrass and crop field, but did between cool-season grasses and crop field. However, %WSA and MWD under switchgrass increased 45.8% and 120.5%, respectively, since 1997; under cool-season grasses %WSA and MWD increased 17.9% and 34.3%, respectively, since 1997, but decreased by 37.0% and 35.2% under row crops. Sixty-minute cumulative infiltration did not significantly differ among MRBs, but was greater than trafficked crop interrows, and was best explained by rainfall rate, bulk density, and initial saturation. Percent rooted vegetation was not a significant factor explaining infiltration in MRBs. Results suggest MRBs do continue to positively impact selected soil physical parameters. Switchgrass may take longer to improve soil quality parameters in MRBs. Soil quality improvements depend upon the edaphic factors and the amount of disturbance on site.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity in the tropics is threatened by a variety of anthropogenic factors, and land cover change may have the most widespread and pervasive impacts. Costa Rica has experienced extensive deforestation, and there is a great need to understand how land cover change has affected stream ecosystems and investigate strategies for mitigating these impacts. Understanding the distribution of freshwater biodiversity in relatively pristine systems is also critical for effective conservation planning. To examine the effects of deforestation on stream communities in southeastern Costa Rica and test the hypothesis that riparian forest buffers can reduce these effects, comparisons were made between forested stream reaches and stream reaches adjacent to pasture with and without a riparian forest buffer. Based on these comparisons, deforestation appeared to significantly alter the diversity and taxonomic composition of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the study streams, as well as stream temperatures and allochthonous inputs. Reaches with a riparian forest buffer, however, generally maintained aquatic assemblages and stream ecosystem conditions more similar to those observed in forested reaches. Overall, these results provide support for existing Costa Rican regulations mandating riparian forest protection, and suggest that appropriate riparian management could significantly reduce the impacts of deforestation on tropical stream biota. To investigate landscape-scale patterns in fish diversity, stream fishes were sampled along an altitudinal gradient of nearly 500 m in the Sixaola River basin. Fish diversity decreased steeply with increasing elevation, and the main gradient in assemblage structure was strongly correlated with several stream habitat variables. Diadromous fishes were common throughout the altitudinal gradient and dominated the highest elevation sites, highlighting the importance of longitudinal connectivity in Mesoamerican river systems. Systematic conservation planning that focuses on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as biophysical linkages between these realms, could potentially identify more efficient and effective reserve networks. A critical evaluation of existing planning methods illustrates how incorporating linkages among ecosystems increases planning complexity. Several of the methods reviewed would be applicable to an example planning domain in Costa Rica and Panama, but new tools will be needed to realize the full potential of a comprehensive planning approach.

AB  - Three vegetative buffer strip (VBS) treatments were established to receive nitrogen runoff from row crops in the Elkhorn Slough watershed. Treatments included a native perennial grass mix, an exotic annual grass, and a ruderal treatment. I compared the treatments by measuring inorganic soil nitrogen (N), microbial and plant biomass N, nitrification potentials, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production, denitrification rates, and groundwater nitrate concentrations. Driven by the Mediterranean climate, the oscillation between the dry and wet seasons influenced N dynamics; soil inorganic N accumulated in the summer and autumn and declined in the winter. Plant species composition influenced soil N availability via mineralization and plant uptake during the summer and autumn. The perennial treatment retained more N in biomass, while the annual and ruderal treatments allowed inorganic soil N to accumulate each fall. Groundwater in the VBSs was derived from a combination of subsurface flow, surface runoff from the row crops. As the subsurface water moved through the buffer, nitrate concentrations declined, suggesting nitrate attenuation. Soil water anion concentrations varied greatly among plots because of farm management, subsurface flow paths, and weather patterns. High nitrate concentrations with the first rain each fall signified high leaching losses. The ruderal treatment allowed more nitrate leaching through the autumn and winter. Denitrification rates and N2 O production were highest in December 1996 and 1997 and lowest in May 1997. Buffer location significantly affected N gas production, where rates were highest at the slope bottom furthest from the row crops. Compared to the other treatments, the ruderal treatment generally produced more N gases. The mean N 2 O production rate was highest in December 1997 with 33 g N2 O-N/ha/day, which suggests that these buffers were N2 O 'hotspots'. Vegetative buffer strips had been established to reduce N in agricultural runoff. However, the improvement of water quality may come at the expense of increasing greenhouse gases. Furthermore, VBS treatments alternated between being a nitrogen sink and source, depending on the season. This study suggests that VBSs should be seen as one important but insufficient strategy to protect water quality from surface water nitrogen contamination in California.

AB  - Pollinators contribute to up to one-third of the food eaten by humans and are currently experiencing a global decline that may be driven by agricultural practices. To better understand the impact of agriculture on pollinators, the pollinators in agricultural settings must first be identified. A pollinator survey using bee bowls and sweep net sampling was conducted across wild or planted flowering cover preceding corn and in alfalfa surrounded by corn to determine pollinator richness and abundance in highly managed agricultural areas. In total, 1,250 bees comprised of 4 families and 16 genera, 20,841 pollinating Diptera assigned to 6 families, 247 pollinating Coleoptera assigned to 3 families, and 141 Lepidoptera were found. A majority of the bees were solitary and nested in the ground. Insecticides are widely used in agriculture and may move out of the treated field into non-target sources, coming into contact with beneficial insects, such as bees. To determine the risk of insecticide exposure that bees might face when foraging on plants growing along the margins of treated fields, flowers were collected from field margins and analyzed using the QuEChERS method coupled with LS-MS/MS to determine the concentration of non-target uptake of insecticides into flowers. Low concentrations and incidence of neonicotinoid, organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid insecticides were found in non-target flowers along field margins. When the insecticide concentrations were compared with the LD50 values for bees, there appears to be minimal lethal risks through flowers along field margins.

AB  - Transgenic Bt cotton is highly effective against the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). After large-scale commercial use of transgenic Bt cotton, researches focusing on its potential ecological risks should be carried out. These studies are expected to be helpful in reasonable and continuous use of the transgenic Bt cotton and its pest management. The major results and conclusions are as following: 1. Systematic investigations were conducted on the effect of weeds of cotton field edges on population dynamics of cotton spider mites to evaluate influence of eradicating cotton edge weeds on occurrence of cotton spider mites in North China in 2003-2004. Results showed (1) Eradicating the weeds on cotton edges proved to be more effective in weakening the damage caused by cotton spider mites than retaining them. (2) The distance between weeds and sampled cotton plants was negatively correlated with Damage index of cotton spider mites. 2. Field studies were carried out to evaluate the effect of two transgenic cotton varieties (SGK321 carrying Cry1A+CpTI and DP99B carrying Cry1Ac) and the conventional variety (shiyuian321-parental line of SGK321) to spider mites, Tetranychus spp. from 2002 to 2004. These results suggest that Bt cotton has no effect on spider mites populations. However, spider mites have potential to lead to severe damage in Bt cotton fields. Acaricides are essential tool in controlling cotton spider mites in Northern China. 3. The small-scale spatial distribution of spider mites, Tetranychus spp., and damage in cotton, Gossupium hirsutum L., was characterized using geostatistics during 2003-2005. Semivariograms were calculated to model the change in spatial correlation with increasing distance between samples. Spatial distribution of feeding damage during 2004-2005 was best described using an exponential model. Damage was spatially correlated among plants at distances up to 12.24 m apart. The spatial distribution of spider mites in 2003 was best described using an exponential model or a spherical model for different growing stage. Spider mites were spatially correlated among plants at distances up to 17.10 m apart. These data have implications for developing sampling plans for management of Tetranychus spp., and for site-specific pest management. 4. A two-year study was conducted to evaluate the role of four winter wheat varieties that were resistant or susceptible to wheat aphid, Sitobion avenae Fabricius in conserving arthropod natural enemies and suppressing cotton aphids in a wheat-cotton relay intercropping system in northern China. The results indicated that wheat¿cotton intercropping preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of cotton. The density of natural enemies in cotton was significantly different among relay intercropping fields with different wheat varieties. The highest density of natural enemies and lower cotton aphid populations were found in the treatment of cotton in relay intercropped with the wheat variety `Lovrin10¿ that is susceptible to wheat aphid. The lowest density of predators and parasitoids associated with higher cotton aphid populations were found with the wheat variety `KOK1679¿ that is resistant to wheat aphid. The results showed that wheat varieties that are susceptible or moderately resistant to wheat aphid might reduce cotton aphids more effectively than an aphid-resistant variety in the intercropping system by enhancing predators to suppress cotton aphids during the cotton seedling stage. 5. Interactions between the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), the Cry1Ac toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner, and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hyphomycetes) were evaluated. Cry1Ac is toxic to O. furnacalis. Not only would the larval growth and development be delayed, but the ratio of pupation and pupal weight would be also decreased when they were fed on artificial diet containing purified Cry1Ac toxin. Cry1Ac toxin acted additively r antagonistically with B.bassiana for third instar O. furnacalis either exposed to both pathogens simultaneously or had feed on Cry1Ac diet. However, the high susceptibility of B.bassiana was the third instar larvae that had reared in diet containing Cry1Ac. The results implicate that B. bassiana and transgenic Bt cotton could potentially play complementary roles for resistance management of O. furnacalis.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the ecology of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, the causal agent of halo blight of beans, in the Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions, northern Tanzania. A total of 118 isolates were collected from November 1988 to February 1990, and examined for pathogenic variability using four differential bean cultivars. Three races were found; race 2 occurred at a higher frequency (52.5%) than race 1 (44.9%) and race 3 (2.5%). Some isolates of race 2, designated race 2P, produced a brown diffusible pigment on agar media. Some race 2P isolates grew at a higher temperature (34 $\pm$ 2$\sp\circ$C) than the non-pigment-producing race 2 isolates or race 1 and 3 isolates. Race 2 isolates obtained from bean debris in Monduli, Arusha region, were more virulent than those isolated from growing bean plants. They induced systemic chlorosis and stunting on the usually resistant differential bean cultivar, Edmund. The ability of P.s. pv. phaseolicola to survive in bean debris and in dead standing bean plants varied depending on race, geographical location, depth of placement in the soil and the bean genotype used. Volunteer bean plants also provided an alternative survival site for halo blight bacteria. Of the 17 weed species belong to 10 families, only Neonotonia wightii served as a perennial reservoir of P.s. pv. phaseolicola. The weed survived the dry periods on fences, hedge rows, by roadsides, on ditch banks near bean fields and in corners of farmers' fields. Only race 1 of the bacterium was recovered from N. wightii. However, under artificial inoculation the weed was susceptible to all three races. Since race 1 of P.s. pv. phaseolicola was not seed-borne in N. wightii, this precludes the weed spreading the halo blight pathogen into new areas through seed. Intercropping beans with maize favored multiplication of halo blight bacteria on and in bean leaves, and resulted in more severe disease on pods and in a higher percentage of seed infection, than occurred in beans grown in pure stands. Maize leaves did not support high populations of halo blight bacteria, and thus do not seem to provide additional inoculum for the bean crop when the two are grown in association.

AB  - In the boreal forest, understory vegetation accounts for the majority of floristic diversity and affects overstory succession and productivity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In riparian forests, understory vegetation also plays an important functional role by reducing erosion, stabilizing the stream channel, and regulating water quality and quantity. Despite this critical importance, effects of harvesting on understory plant communities in riparian forests are still poorly understood. This study uses data from two boreal ecozones in Canada to quantify how overstory harvesting affects understory vegetation communities and how isturbance-response relationships vary from stream edge to uplands. Using data collected during the summer before harvesting (Yr 0), and three summers after harvesting (Yrs 1, 5 and 7) from headwater stream sites on the Boreal Plain study area (Central Alberta), compositional stability (i.e., the measure of change in community membership and abundance) was measured following disturbance. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to ordinate vegetation plots using species cover, and then measured vector length in the ordination space to quantify floristic dissimilarity (i.e., inverse of compositional stability) of each sample plot. Streamside understory plant communities were compositionally more stable relative to upland communities following clearcut harvesting. Compositional stability was positively related to pre-harvest species richness and negatively related to pre-harvest bryoid cover. Changes in species diversity, abundance and turnover following harvesting were also examined. Streamside communities harvested with or without a 30 m riparian buffer, were maintained to a condition similar to uncut forests. However, upland communities were less resistant to overstory harvest, relative to streamside communities, and subsequently colonized by grasses, forbs, and tall shrubs; many of which were present in pre-harvest riparian plots. Mechanical site preparation (i.e., scarification) exacerbates environmental changes following overstory harvest by destroying above- and below-ground plant parts and coarse woody debris and removing more of the forest floor. The response of boreal understory plant communities to overstory harvesting with and without scarification was examined on 24 small stream sites on Boreal Shield (Northwestern Ontario) watersheds. Species composition was not strongly affected by harvesting when forest floor and soil disturbance is minimal; but it was following scarification. However, this effect varied with habitat. First, the riparian and upland plots that were harvested and scarified diverged from the uncut plant communities; however this effect was stronger in the upland communities. Second, changes within the community following scarification were not detectable in the transitional communities; these communities retain species of both riparian and upland communities and thus their flora has lower site fidelity and likely tolerates a wider range of environmental conditions. Scarification profoundly alters the substrate by breaking up coarse woody debris and decreasing the depth of organic matter, which destroys forest floor feathermosses and creates a habitat suitable for early colonizing species (i.e., grasses). This study indicates that streamside understory plant communities are inherently more resilient to stand-replacing disturbance than upland assemblages. I attribute this to the higher moisture availability and shading from tall shrubs associated with riparian habitat that buffers the effect of harvesting on shade-tolerant species in streamside plots. Thus, the response to harvesting is not as marked as it is in the uplands. This study highlights that understory disturbance response relationships can differ within a small spatial scale (i.e., 30 m) based on habitat characteristics, imparted by hydrological processes and disturbance regimes that drive community composition.

AB  - Global demand for agricultural products is an increasingly important driver of deforestation in the Amazon Basin. This dissertation examines the consequences of agricultural expansion for stream ecosystems in the southern Amazon's agricultural frontier. At regional scales, the removal of watershed forest cover is known to change the energy balance and influence hydro-climatic cycling by altering stream flow, regional rainfall patterns, and land surface temperatures. At the landscape scale, these physical changes may be further exacerbated by land management practices that lead to the degradation of riparian forest buffers; decreases in connectivity; changes in the amount of light, nutrient, and sediment inputs; and decreases in water quality. Together, land use and management influence the quality and distribution of aquatic habitats within stream networks, potentially decreasing stream biotic integrity and resilience to further disturbances. Brazil's Mato Grosso state is one of the most actively expanding agricultural frontiers in the world and represents an ideal case study for examining the linkages among tropical deforestation, agricultural expansion, and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems. Mato Grosso accounted for 40% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon during the early 2000s--primarily due to the expansion of soybeans and cattle ranching. Deforestation rates have since dropped throughout the Amazon, but there is a lack of spatially explicit information about the land use transitions accompanying this decline. To address this gap, I combined government data on deforestation and production with the MODIS satellite time series to quantify the spatial-temporal dynamics of land use change in the region. Although agricultural expansion during this period slowed with declining commodity prices, the decline in deforestation is partly explained by a shift from soybean expansion into forests (26% of expansion from 2001-2005) to expansion into already cleared pasture lands (9% of expansion form 2006-2010). Beyond documenting these trends, the resulting dataset is a critical first step in evaluating the influence of land use and land use history on freshwater ecosystems at multiple scales. In the headwaters region of the Xingu River Basin, the proportion of small watersheds (microbasins) dominated by agriculture (>60% of area) increased from 20 to 40% from 2001 to 2010. At the same time, the stream network became increasingly fragmented by the removal of riparian forest buffers and installation of farm impoundments. I used high resolution satellite data (ASTER) to produce the first landscape-level documentation of farm impoundments in the region, mapping approximately 10,000 impoundments (one per 7.6 km of stream length) in 2007. At the catchment scale, I collected field data in 12 headwater streams to examine the effect of land management on instream water quality. Watershed forest cover (from MODIS), the density of impoundments (from ASTER), and the percent forest in upstream riparian buffers (from Landsat) were all associated with substantial increases in stream temperature. These increases in fragmentation and water temperature may have large cumulative effects on the stream network and reduce the ability of downstream protected areas to conserve freshwater resources. At the scale of the Amazon Basin, my analysis indicates that 30% of indigenous lands and protected areas are highly vulnerable to future reductions in hydrologic connectivity, simply because of their location within their watersheds. These impacts could be substantially mitigated through enforcement of existing legislation to protect riparian buffers and new regulations to limit the number of impoundments in emerging agricultural landscapes.

AB  - In situations where water courses are at a high risk of NO3-N pollution from intensively managed pastures, protection by buffer zones may be an effective solution. The design criteria for effective buffer zones for grassland have yet to be established. While earlier research focused on the use of riparian woodlands, the work presented here evaluates the effectiveness of woodlands located midslope, adjacent to the source of diffuse N pollution.Experiments were conducted at 3 scales in an area of mid-Devon on soils representative of approximately 13% of England and Wales. At the fine-scale, 9 plots were set up to study the mechanisms of N buffering. An N-rich pulse of drainage was passed through hydrologically isolated buffer zones containing young willows (Salix viminalis) and poplar (Populus spp. ) trees and ryegrass (Lolium perenne). At an intermediate-scale, a plot containing 12 year-old willows was used to study the role of hydrology and seasonality in buffering. At the widest scale, soil N was measured in woodlands adjacent to intensively managed pastures on farms across mid-Devon. Denitrification was measured on several occasions in the fine-scale plots.Nitrate concentrations of over 60 mgl-1 were reduced to environmentally acceptable levels within 15 m in the plot experiments on almost all sampling occasions. It was concluded that the degree of buffering must have been influenced by the extent of preferential flow, and by soil moisture content. Rapid buffering was ascribed to immobilisation by soil micropores. Plant uptake has the potential to be a large sink in the long term if harvested and removed. Denitrification was proposed to be a major sink for nitrate in the study area throughout much of the year, and may preclude a situation in which a nutrient input/output equilibrium is reached.

AB  - Many species of forest songbirds are negatively affected by forest fragmentation, a process now occurring in the boreal mixedwood region of Alberta. I studied forest-songbird communities there to: assess the value of forests near watercourses (riparian buffer strips) to songbirds, relative to upland forest; to determine if communities were affected by adjacent harvesting; and to determine if songbirds use and need buffer strips for movement corridors between reserves. I found that forests near watercourses supported more species and individuals than upland forest, both with and without accounting for habitat differences. Songbirds were not severely impacted by the creation of buffer strips. Only the Ovenbird was clearly affected by fragmentation; its spatial distribution in the forest changed and its abundance declined. Songbirds use buffer strips as travel corridors; significantly more forest birds were captured in buffer strips than were seen moving across adjacent clearcuts. Most of the juveniles capture d in buffer strips were probably dispersing individuals. The conservation of forest songbirds in the boreal mixedwood would be aided by making buffer strips as wide as possible ($>$100 m) and by leaving areas of forest connected by corridors.

AB  - If upland rice production is to be sustained on sloping land, soil erosion and fertility decline must be addressed. Where soil profiles are deep, hedgerows of Gliricidia sepium and Cassia spectabilis, planted on the contour, reduce soil erosion by promoting terrace formation and overcome fertility depletion by providing nutrient rich biomass. G. sepium and C. spectabilis established by seed survived better than by cuttings. Although increased hedgerow biomass was initially obtained when both species were intercropped, intense competition was observed in established hedgerows. Consequently, mixing both species at high planting density is not recommended as C. spectabilis, a non-fixing legume, may deplete soil-N reserves. In acid soils, biomass production of G. sepium was significantly increased when lime (6 t/ha) was applied. On 18 to 30% slopes, upland rice and maize production improved along fertility and moisture gradients. Rice yields were increased when biomass of G. sepium was incorporated into the soil, up to an optimum level equivalent to 40 kg N/ha. Mulching C. spectabilis increased maize productivity during the drought prone second season. Competition was observed at the hedgerow-crop interface particularly at the upper one as a result of terracing. Although green manuring increased crop yield, broadleaf weeds, seedling maggot, stemborer and blast also increased. Strategies to manage hedgerow biomass that minimize these problems need to be developed.

AB  - Plant resources were provided for epigeal beneficial polyphagous predators of cereal aphids, as a raised grassy bank 290m long, sown with grass species of contrasting structure, within a 7ha field. Densities of polyphagous predators overwintering in the grasses were estimated by sampling from grass plots during winters (1987/88 to 1993/94). Data are presented which illustrate how densities of taxa of polyphagous predators have fluctuated during the seven winters. Samples measuring densities of polyphagous predators over the last three winters of the study showed that the within-field grass bank supported greater densities of beneficial predators than an adjacent permanent field boundary.Floral resources in the form of the crucifer Lobularia maritima, provided along an arable field margin for hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), in the summer, were selectively foraged upon and preferred to native arable weeds by a variety of hoverfly species with aphidophagous larvae. A white coloured variety, compared with a purple coloured variety, compared with a purple coloured variety of L.maritima was consistently visited and foraged upon more frequently, by Episyrphus balteatus, in laboratory and field experiments.Observational studies showed that potential alternative crops were also foraged upon by beneficial Syrphidae. A field trail, using the potential alternative crop coriander, did not show any significant redistribution of Syrphidae between fields with and without border strips of coriander. Further observational studies on a hedgerow, with its floral diversity and available resources increased by sowing a mixture of alternative crops in a strip, between the hedge and crop, showed that E.balteatus remained at the enhanced strip for significantly longer periods than at the control strip. A simple model shows that the difference in numbers of E.balteatus caught in water-traps at either site cannot be fully explained simply by E.balteatus remaining at the florally diverse site for longer. To explain the differences in trap catches, E.balteatus must have immigrated to the florally diverse strip at a higher rate than to the control strip. Higher syrphid immigration rate to the florally diverse strip may have been due to the visual attractiveness of the diverse site.Although Syrphidae are highly mobile, linear features on arable land influenced their distribution. A road and tall hedge were shown to be significant obstacles preventing the even distribution of at least one syrphid species. The potential and limitations of habitat enhancement techniques for biological control agents on farmland are discussed.

AB  - This thesis examines phosphorus and nitrate transport in a first-order agricultural catchment in Southern Ontario. Specific areas of concern relate to (1) long- and short-term temporal variability in nutrient export patterns, (2) the role of drainage tiles in annual nutrient export, (3) the effects of antecedent hydrologic conditions (AHC) on nutrient export patterns and (4) temporal variability in the nutrient retention in riparian buffer strips and streams. Temporal variability in hydrochemical export from the study basin over a two-year period is described and quantified and the importance of high magnitude events is highlighted. This is the first comprehensive study to examine the role of such events in annual nutrient export from agricultural catchments (17-58% of annual nutrient export). The significance of winter thaws and in particular major snowmelt events in annual nutrient export from agricultural catchments in Southern Ontario is shown and the need to include the winter period in sampling regimes is demonstrated. The importance of sampling frequency is examined and an improved sampling strategy is suggested for the study basin. The role of drainage tiles in annual hydrochemical export from the basin is quantified and the dominance of drainage tiles as a nutrient source is shown. Tiles account for approximately 42% of annual discharge, but account for the majority of SRP, TP and NO 3- export. Tiles within the study basin exhibit spatial and temporal variability in hydrochemical export patterns but the discharge from all tiles within the basin can be predicted from one continuously monitored tile. The effect of antecedent hydrologic conditions in hydrochemical export and the complex effects of successive events on hydrochemical export patterns are also demonstrated. In general, hydrochemical export increases as conditions become successively wetter, although empirical relationships between hydrological variables in the catchment and hydrochemical export are weak. Hydrologic connectivity between surface horizons and drainage tiles by macropores and preferential flowpaths appears to be critical in exporting nutrients from the catchment, and the role of these flowpaths increases as conditions become wetter. The in-stream retention of phosphate during low flows is examined. Stream sediments are unable to retain large pulses of phosphate during very low flow periods due to poor mixing in the water column. The stream is therefore unable to retain pulses of phosphate that may occur following the irrigation of fields receiving liquid manure applications or when fertilizers are directly applied into ditches. These individual studies improve our general understanding of nutrient dynamics and export from agricultural watersheds. This thesis increases our ability to predict nutrient export by (a) suggesting a new sampling strategy to improve the precision of nutrient export estimates in basins; and (b) identifying critical periods of nutrient export and linking these to antecedent hydrologic conditions in the basin.

AB  - Forestry practices cause impacts on loss of understory vegetation. I used data from 161 permanent plots monitored over a decade in two harvesting treatments (clearcutting with natural regeneration and clearcutting with mechanical site preparation) and two unharvested treatments (riparian buffer strip and upland forest). The objectives are to 1) determine changes in understory species diversity and composition in response to the four treatments, 2) assess changes in abundance of disturbance-sensitive species, 3) relate changes in understory composition to forest floor substrates and residual canopy cover, and 4) relate species' responses to the species' functional traits. There was < 50 % change in species composition in clearcutting with natural regeneration, but > 50 % (gain of 20 open-habitat species and loss of 17 forest-habitat species) in clearcutting with mechanical site preparation. The use of mechanically prepared sites should be reduced to minimize extirpations of sensitive species.

AB  - Genetically modified (GM) crops are crops in which single or multiple genes have been introduced artificially in order to obtain certain characteristics that are difficult to obtain through conventional breeding. Even though farmers have the right to freely choose what types of crops to grow, pollen mediated gene flow from GM crops to non-GM crops can limit the possibility for crops to coexist on a same landscape, resulting in economic losses that depend on the institutional arrangements and the type of property rights in place. Although it is well known that spatial variability affects the degree of cross-contamination between GM and non-GM crops, no spatial analysis has been carried out to investigate how heterogeneity of landscapes influences the possibility for GM and non-GM crops to coexist. We aim with this research to analyze how spatial variability affects land allocation between GM and non-GM corn crops through a model composed of two parts: the first one simulates spatial units based on landscape criteria through Voronoi diagrams, and the second one reallocates the land between buffers, the GM and the non-GM crop based on cross-contamination and initial assignment of property rights. The model identifies coexistence clusters based on the deviation from an initial land allocation. We show that increasing spatial variability reduces the possibility of acceptable coexistence of crops and increases the economic losses. The economic impact from the assignment of property rights depends on the parameters that drive profitability differences (average market prices, yields and production costs). We show that buffer zones enforced to reduce cross-contamination result in less coexistence in heterogeneous spatial situations. We also elicit the economic value of unobserved factors that create a competitive advantage for certain farmers necessary for alternative crops to coexist on the same landscape.

AB  - The landscape surrounding a particular stream or river has a complex relationship with the aquatic habitat, influencing ecological health on multiple scales. Alteration of the landscape through anthropogenic activity represents a primary threat to rivers and streams via a variety of mechanisms, including habitat loss, nutrient enrichment, pollution, riparian zone and canopy destruction, and alteration of hydrology. Nutrient enrichment in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus is associated with eutrophication, increased primary productivity, decreased biodiversity, and hypoxia in both freshwater and marine environments. Nitrate retention and loss can be controlled by several factors, including a variety of biological mechanisms by which nitrogen is temporarily or permanently removed from agriculturally impacted subsurface waterways. A dominant sink for nitrate is denitrification, carried out exclusively by denitrifying bacteria. Denitrifiers are able to reduce nitrate to nitrous oxide or di-nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions, thus removing nitrate permanently from the system. Although the process of denitrification in streams is well studied, it is unclear how varying hydrologic regimes in agriculturally impacted streams and riparian buffer zones affect the denitrifying community's structure. In this study, the effect of varying hydrologic regimes on microbial community composition and denitrification rates in agriculturally impacted streams was examined. The role of flooding in driving microbial community composition and denitrification rates of naturally formed riparian benches along a primary headwater agricultural stream was also examined via a simulated flooding experiment. Results suggest that hydrology plays a significant role in determining denitrification rate, likely due to changes in sediment and soil redox potentials. Results also suggest that bacterial community structure (i.e. 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, nosZ gene copy numbers, and relative denitrifier abundance) is not a good predictor of changes in denitrification rate and subsequent nitrate removal.

AB  - Forest-field edges dominate the landscape in eastern North America. Tree establishment in old-fields results in substantial changes in forest edge structure. Such changes may modify the flow of energy and matter across forest edges, resulting in profound effects on regional patterns of diversity. Previous research suggests herbivores, in particular rodents, can influence tree invasion into old-fields. However, considerable within- and between-study variation has produced few generalizations regarding the effects of rodents on tree propagule survival. Furthermore, studies have had a short-term focus, limiting assessment of overall effects of rodents on tree invasion dynamics. White-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus ) are the dominant seed and seedling predators, respectively, in old-fields. Using these species, I conducted a series of depredation trials designed to identify additional sources of variation impeding generalization across studies, and examine the net effects of these rodents on patterns of tree colonization in old-fields. Mice were found to be attracted to, and voles repelled from, areas of high tree propagule density. This suggests that mice and voles may generate a hyper-dispersed and clumped pattern of tree propagule survival, respectively, and that depredation studies should control for background variation in tree propagule availability. Spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tree propagules occurred in 50% of depredation trials with frequency increasing as a function of declining vole density and higher site heterogeneity. A literature review showed few depredation studies attempt to control for spatial autocorrelation either through adequate spacing of replicates or through the use of statistical techniques. Both the activity and foraging behavior of mice and voles was best predicted by vegetation cover measured at intermediate spatial scales suggesting depredation studies need to modify the grain and extent of focus. Correlations were more consistent and stronger between voles, vegetation cover, and seedling survival versus mice and seed survival. In addition, natural tree seedling recruitment after four years of study was found to be much greater in areas of low vole density as well as in habitats preferred by this species, suggesting this species may be a keystone herbivore along forest-field edges. Results suggest more careful design of experiments, species-specific and community-based approaches, and longer-term studies may clarify the role of rodent herbivores in old-field succession. This information may be helpful in conservation efforts along forest-field ecotones.

AB  - University of Washington Abstract The Effect of Agricultural Riparian Buffer Width on Generalist Natural Enemy Diversity Matthew Chabot Maria Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Sarah E. Reichard School of Environmental and Forest Sciences Wooded stream buffers support food production, from fish to farms. While wider buffers of conservation woodlands do improve salmon habitat (Beechie & Sibley 1997), they decrease arable cropland. Riparian buffers do, however, benefit agriculture through erosion control, wind protection and habitat for beneficial species. Some of these beneficial species are termed "natural enemies," as they are the traditional biological control, or predators, of herbivorous crop pests. Many beetles and spiders are prime examples of natural enemies because of their generalist feeding on several families of crop pests (Landis et al. 2000, Landis & Wratten 2002). There is growing support that greater natural enemy diversity correlates to a greater control of crop pests (Lehman & Tilman 2000, Gardiner et al. 2009) Using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index I measured the diversity as well as the abundance of generalist natural enemies moving between fields and riparian buffers at different spatial scales (5', 15', 35', and 180' wide buffers from the stream) during a corn growing season. The 180 foot buffer exhibited significantly greater natural enemy diversity during early corn growth suggesting that larger buffers can provide greater biological control when crops are most susceptible to pest outbreak.

AB  - Forest and grass riparian buffer systems provide year-round soil cover, limiting erosion, and favoring soil development processes by potentially increasing soil C sequestration. Plant-soil interactions influence patterns of soil aggregation and organic matter storage. And have a major positive impact on the soil ecological functions that maintain and enhance both water and environmental quality. In this dissertation a new theoretical and experimental framework is presented that introduces the concept and determination of aggregate size-stability distribution. In addition, two new indexes, the soil stability index and the total soil stability index, both based on aggregate, are proposed for studying soil stability. Finally, the soil aggregates dynamics model, that integrates the aggregation, disruption, stabilization, and destabilization processes of soil aggregates, is developed for studying soil aggregate dynamics. The size-stability distribution and the soil aggregate dynamics model were used to assess aggrading and degrading processes that occur in riparian soils. Pooled data from 1997 and 1998 showed that the major soil process following conversion of cool-season grass to agricultural row crops is disruption, with 19% of the large and small macroaggregates being disrupted. This disruption of macroaggregates exposes previously protected labile organic carbon to decomposers, resulting in a loss of 11.3 mg C g -1 soil and further destabilizing the macroaggregates. The amount of total particulate organic C was three times greater under cool-season grass than under cropped system and accounted for 16% of the total organic carbon under and 7% under cropped system. The results indicate that macroaggregates under cool-season grass are more stable and provide an important mechanism for C sequestration supporting higher amounts of both light and heavy particulate organic matter than cropped system. Additional results indicate that the "net" soil aggregate process in a 7-year old switchgrass stand that was converted from a cropped system is aggregation, which yields 3% new unstable macroaggregates. The storage of soil organic C under switchgrass occurs at a rate of ∼43 g m -2 y-1 .

AB  - This project examined value of field shelterbelts in agricultural production and assessed the prospects for using them in adapting to climate change using a benefit-cost analysis approach. The financial analysis indicated positive returns for discount rates above eight percent without cost share. However, without the benefit of cost-share, producers would endure a significant period of negative returns. When cost share was included, negative returns were all but eliminated and benefits exceeded costs up to a discount rate of 37 percent. Economic analysis indicated favorable returns to a public investment in shelterbelts for discount rates approaching ten percent. With erosion-control costs comparable to those for the establishment of permanent grass cover, it was concluded that shelterbelts represent a more efficient investment of public funds where the control of wind erosion is the primary objective. The capacity of shelterbelts to mitigate potential economic losses connected with climate change were assessed. A comparison of the yield impacts of climate change on five million acres of sheltered and unsheltered crops were made. Yield simulations generally indicated a higher yield for sheltered crops than for unsheltered crops. The yield benefits of shelterbelts increased as more stressful climate conditions were considered. Shelterbelts completely erase financial losses for moderately stressful climate change scenarios but shelterbelt protection minimized losses in every other scenario. An input-output model was used to assess the yield impacts of climate change on agricultural production of the entire region. In every climate scenario, the conjectural shelterbelt establishment program provided benefits to the regional economy. Shelterbelt establishment activities and enhanced yields provided a total economic impact of $285 to $698 million for the range of scenarios and were thus capable of reducing total economic losses by an average of five and 32 percent respectively.

AB  - Rich in biodiversity, Tanzania's protected areas (PAs) are internationally recognized as of primary conservation value. Biodiversity loss continues, however, and limited understanding of ecological stocks and limited funding for management are making it harder to plan and carry out conservation activities. Lwafi Game Reserve (GR) is an important part of the conservation network in western Tanzania that falls in the Katavi - Rukwa ecosystem in Rukwa Region, Tanzania. I examined the role of Lwafi GR in protecting wildlife and facilitating movements between Katavi National Park (NP) and Loasi and Kalambo Forest Reserves (FRs). In particular I assessed the abundance and distribution of Lwafi GR mammals, determined signs of movements of mammals between Lwafi GR and Loasi and Kalambo FRs and possibly further into Zambia, established and quantified threats to the survival of wildlife in Lwafi GR, and determined perceived and real boundaries of Lwafi GR. My findings show that farming, hunting, logging and charcoal production take place inside and around the Reserves. Farming is dominant on the western boundaries especially adjacent to Loasi and Kalambo FRs both inside and around the border of the Reserves. The intensity of livestock incursion is similar between the eastern and western sides of the Reserves, but livestock graze more around the border on the western side than the eastern side of the Reserves. Additionally, I find that the distance from village settlements to the Reserves is much more important in determining the occurrence of human activities inside and around the PAs than the distance to town/market. For the ecological part of the study, I found 38 species of mammals in the surveyed area. The mammals are more abundant in the northern part of Lwafi GR (Lyazumbi - Kabwe and Kakoma - Ninde transects) than in the south (Namanyere - Kipili, China - Wampembe and King'ombe - Kala transects). The presence of some species declined with the distance from the nearest village center, some increased, and others did not change. Most of the species that showed a decline - eland ( Taurotragus oryx ), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis ), impala (Aepyceros melampus ), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus ), roan (Hippotragus equinus ), blue duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia ), and dik dik (Madoqua kirkii ) - could be attributed to hunting since they are consumed by locals; however some edible species did not demonstrate this trend. These species include buffalo (Syncerus caffer ), bush buck (Tragelaphus scriptus ), klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus ) and bush rat (Thryonomys ). Generally species including elephant (Loxodonta africana ) were found throughout Lwafi GR with some declines towards the southern part of the GR, possibly due to the availability of food, shelter and cover. In particular, species such as African palm civet (Nandinia binotata ), bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia ), lion (Panthera leo ), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum ), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger ), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii ), topi ( Damaliscus korrigum ) and zebra (Equus quagga ),were seen in Lwafi GR only in the dry season and disappeared in the wet season. These species either migrated to Katavi NP during the wet season or are less detectable during that time. I conclude that Lwafi GR is facing acute anthropogenic pressures. Additionally, Lwafi GR is an important depository for wildlife and a potential area for developing tourism; the presence of carnivores such as lion, aardvark ( Orycteropus afer ), black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas ), leopard (Panthera pardus ), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus ) can offer a special attraction to tourists. This could be complimented by Kalambo Falls at the Tanzania - Zambia border. I suggest that the Tanzania government should consider enlarging the size of Lwafi GR and that the Mahale - Katavi corridor be upgraded to a Wildlife Management Area (WMA), a status that ensures management by local people. Finally, there should be periodic ecological survey in order to have long-term records on animal as well as other biodiversity in Lwafi GR. With regard to connectivity to Zambia's PAs, I suggest that wildlife authorities on both sides consider the protection of a wildlife corridor to Nsumbu NP in Zambia. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Field-based pitfall and aerial trapping were used to examine the effects of modern broad-spectrum (Dimethoate and Demeton-S-methyl) and selective (Pirimicarbs; Aztec and Aphox) compounds on numerically dominant aerial predators, carabids and Araneae in four brassica crops. The results for the field-based examination in calabrese, cauliflower and Brussels sprout were equivocal, stressing the importance of seasonal and phenological fluctuations in predator activity. Community analysis using DECORANA similarly stressed the effect of seasonal change with no separation of chemical treatments being apparent. These seasonal fluctuations were discussed in terms of beneficial timings of chemical applications and the masking effects of phenological change on the effects of chemical applications. Examination of the influence of the field margins highlighted the differing vegetative structures of each crop and margin and the minimal observable effect of the insecticides. The field results for cabbage indicated significant interactions between the insecticides and the activity-density of the carabids. Treated with either the broad-spectrum or the selective compounds, carabid activity-density decreased significantly during the weeks post treatment when compared to the controls. Effects of these applications are discussed in relation to the relative efficacies of these chemicals, potential implications for pest management and the microclimatic differnces between different brassica crops. Using two common pest predators Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera; Carabidae) and Lepthyphantes tenuis (Blackwall) (Araneae; Linyphiidae), a further examination of the sub-lethal effects of insecticides on locomotion, activity, feeding, predator mass and longevity took place in the laboratory. These laboratory experiments highlighted further significant sub-lethal affects of both the selective (Pirimicarb - Aztec) and broad-spectrum (Organophosphate - Dimethoate) insecticides. Treatment with Dimethoate induced lower rates of feeding, alterations in search patterns and reductions in overall activity. Applications of the selective pirimicarb Aztec induced changes in locomotion and mass when compared to the controls. Exposure of Aranaea to insecticides showed similarly pronounced differnces between treated individuals and the controls.

AB  - Potential impacts to the global climate system, ocean and atmospheric circulation, sea levels, and the environment from dynamic changes in recent decades to the Greenland ice sheet have brought significant attention to two of Greenland's larger outlet glaciers and fast moving ice streams, Jakobshavn Isbrae and Helheim Glacier. These changes include accelerations in surface ice velocity, and are related to a number of glaciological and physical processes, including increased calving, changes in ice stream margins, terminus retreat, and glacial thinning. While there is available data on current surface velocities for outlet glaciers in Greenland, including satellite-derived velocity measurements and ground-based observations, pre-1990 flow velocity field and structure estimates are not as widely available. This thesis study adopts a classic inventory-based approach and documents historical center-line and cross-sectional transect surface ice velocities through the analysis of pre-1990 satellite imagery. Evaluating the baseline surface ice velocity data, in combination with surface velocity estimates, qualitative assessment of imagery, and published research analyzing recent accelerations on Jakobshavn Isbrae and Helheim Glacier, enables a multi-decadal investigation into glaciological and physical change. This investigation fills in existing data gaps in the historical record of observed surface ice velocities by providing 20.0-30.0 km upstream centerline tracks of maximum surface velocity and numerous cross-sectional transects of surface velocities at Jakobshavn Isbrae and Helheim Glacier, confirms the pre-acceleration velocity structures on Jakobshavn Isbrae and Helheim Glacier, documents the changes to near-frontal surface velocity fields pre- and during, and post-acceleration, and documents multi-decadal frontal position changes of thirteen notable outlet glaciers with varying dynamics in western and eastern Greenland.

AB  - Wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services such as water quality improvement, carbon (C) sequestration, nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) retention, and biodiversity support. Throughout the Midwest, wetlands and riparian areas have been drained and cleared for conversion to row-crop agriculture. Through the United States Department of Agriculture, programs such as the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provide landowners an opportunity to restore wetlands and riparian buffers with the goal of reintroducing ecosystem services lost during the conversion to agriculture. However, there has been little research on the effectiveness of WRP and CRP sites in returning ecosystem services to the landscape. To fill this knowledge gap, I measured water quality improvement functions (denitrification and P sorption), C sequestration, and nutrient (N,P) accumulation in natural and restored wetlands and riparian buffers in Indiana and Ohio. I also evaluated which of three USDA conservation practices (e.g., restored wetland, restored riparian, conserved riparian) provided the greatest relative level of water quality improvement functions. I then characterized fine-scale spatial variability of denitrification and associated soil properties in natural and restored wetlands to determine if restored wetlands had comparable heterogeneity relative to natural wetlands. Overall, riparian areas had higher rates of denitrification, P sorption, and C sequestration than depressional wetlands. Restored and natural riparian areas provided comparable services, whereas natural wetlands provided greater services than restored wetlands. Water quality improvement functions (N and P removal) were dependent upon the interactions between parent material (clayey vs. sandy soils), hydrologic connectivity (depressional vs. pulsed), and disturbance regime. First, greater connectivity to adjacent aquatic systems increased N and P removal and C sequestration. Second, finer-textured clayey soils facilitated greater denitrification and P sorption relative to sandier soils. Third, prescribed fires in the restored wetlands inhibited the accumulation of soil organic matter, which influences denitrification and P sorption. Continued enrollment of agricultural land into conservation practices will return ecosystem services to the landscape, although whether wetlands or riparian buffers should be restored will depend upon the desired ecosystem service.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the factors that influenced the farmer in the decision to practice selected agroforestry technologies in Malawi. The influence of the Malawi Agroforestry Extension Project, food productivity, control of soil erosion, fuelwood productivity and profitability were investigated. The influence of demographic variables which included: gender; age; income; education; landholding size and land and tree tenure system was also investigated. The study was conducted in Njolomole Extension Planning Area of Ntcheu RDP in Malawi. A sample of 449 respondents was drawn from the study population of 9236 farm households. Data collection was by interviews which were conducted by five male and four female interviewers. A total of 399 questionnaires were used for data analysis. Exposure to the Malawi Agroforestry Extension Project and control of soil erosion significantly influenced the practice of contour hedgerows. Food productivity significantly influenced the practices of planting and caring for trees in garden boundaries and planting and caring for trees in croplands. Profitability significantly influenced the practice of planting and caring for trees at homesteads. Gender was significantly related to the practices of planting and caring for trees in garden boundaries and planting and caring for trees in croplands. Male farmers practiced planting and caring for trees in garden boundaries and croplands. Farmers' income was significantly related to the practices of woodlots and planting and caring for trees in garden boundaries. Land tenure system significantly influenced the practice of contour hedgerows.

AB  - This thesis presents the findings of a study whose fundamental objective was to understand the functional role of riparian zone denitrification as a buffer to nitrate leaching from agricultural land. The results are the product of (i) a 12-month field and lab. measurement programme based on sampling a grass riparian strip within an agricultural catchment of the River Thame, at Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, and (ii) measurements at other riparian zones sites in the Cotswolds, Shropshire and South Devon. The primary study monitored the dynamics of riparian hydrology, water chemistry and denitrification. It assessed how the ameliorative action of denitrification as a nitrate filter and the consequent emissions of nitrous oxide are regulated by soil physiochemistry. The subsequent investigations established the influence of riparian surface-cover on denitrification and 'tested' a concept advocated for use when seeking to optimise nitrate filtering via denitrification. The combined results served not only to improve understanding of riparian buffer zone denitrification, but consequently provided the necessary knowledge for harnessing its operation within catchment management schemes.Riparian hydrology was found to be a primary influence in determining nitrate removal by denitrification. While there was considerable potential for nitrate filtering via denitrification at the Cuddesdon site, 89% of this lay redundant. Much of the nitrate-rich water moving off the farmland by-passed the riparian zone, instead entering the river directly via a spring or through a gravel lens beneath the floodplain soil. This fact suggested that significant hydrological modification might be necessary before the riparian zone could perform an optimal filtering role.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones, adjacent to waterways, may protect water quality by intercepting and removing nitrogen in runoff from agricultural land. This research comprised four parts: (1) a field study of nitrogen buffering by differently vegetated riparian zones in a United Kingdom (UK) sheep-grazed pastoral catchment; (2) a field study of surface and subsurface runoff hydrology, and nitrogen flux, in a UK riparian wetland; (3) a laboratory study (15N tracer-isotope dilution) of microbial inorganic nitrogen production and removal processes in the UK riparian wetland soil; and (4) a laboratory microcosm study (15N tracer) of nitrate removal processes in bare and plant-inhabited (Glyceria declinata) New Zealand (NZ) riparian wetland soil.Dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium were generally more important components of subsurface runoff than nitrate in the three UK riparian zones. All riparian zones were poor buffers having minimal effect on the nitrogen concentration of subsurface runoff. In the UK riparian wetland site subsurface (saturated zone) and surface 'preferential flow paths' typically conveyed large quantities of catchment runoff rapidly into, and across the site, and hindered nitrogen buffering. However, under low flow conditions runoff-riparian soil contact increased and the wetland decreased the catchment nitrogen flux by 27%. In the UK riparian wetland soil most nitrate removal was attributable to denitrification (87-100%) as opposed to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) (0-13%) and immobilisation (0-10%). Denitrification and, thus, nitrogen buffering might be enhanced, in some riparian zones by increasing the extent of moderately anoxic soil with oxygen-pumping plants or water table management.

AB  - In semi-arid groundwater basins, agricultural irrigation leachate is often the largest water source for aquifer recharge. Fertilizers added to agricultural soils can thus significantly alter the quality of aquifers from which nearby communities draw drinking water. Affected populations frequently include economically disadvantaged rural communities, for whom costly water treatment and non-treatment options may be infeasible. We propose the utilization of clean "recharge buffer zones" between such communities and nearby sources of N-rich recharge water. In this paper, we identify the relationships between proximity to a developing community and crop fertilization, nitrate leaching, and crop economic revenues. We then explore the economic feasibility of establishing land-use buffer zones around disadvantaged communities. We found that alfalfa production and vineyards, in conjunction with recharge basins, are agronomically promising alternative land uses that would improve recharge water quality to these communities.

AB  - Monthly plantings of maize varieties with varying maize streak virus susceptibility and samplings of Cicadulina leafhopper were made between December, 1988 and September, 1990 in humid forest and Guinea savanna zones. MSV incidence and severity were recorded every 3 wk. Leafhoppers were sampled with a net cage, tested for MSV inoculativity and identified to species. High MSV incidences were observed on TZB-Gusao (susceptible) in late and second season plantings. Resistant variety 8321-21 showed significantly lower MSV incidence and severity. Screenhouse trials also indicated lower MSV severity ratings for 8321-21. Cicadulina population peaks and high rates of MSV transmission were observed before and after rainy periods in savanna and forest zones, respectively. C. mbila was the predominant species, with C. storeyi (syn. C. triangula) and three other species being less common. Interactions between MSV incidence, Cicadulina population components and physical factors are discussed. C. storeyi, marked with fluorescent dye, were released at dusk in maize fields and monitored over 14 days using sticky traps placed at different distances from the release point. C. storeyi catches decreased linearly with distance and exponentially with time. The suitability of maize growth stages, varieties and plants for settling and oviposition by C. storeyi was investigated. C. storeyi preferred young over old maize and MSV-infected over healthy maize plants, but showed no preference among varieties for oviposition. The biology of and MSV transmissibility by C. arachidis and C. ghaurii were studied in the laboratory. These species showed similar developmental periods and different fecundities compared to C. storeyi. C. arachidis was an inefficient vector, while C. ghaurii was as efficient as C. mbila and C. storeyi. Transmission abilities of MSV isolates acquired from maize varieties and grass species by C. storeyi and C. mbila were investigated. These isolates varied in MSV transmission efficiencies. A field of 0.25 ha planted with a MSV-susceptible variety in the humid forest zone was divided into 85 quadrats. MSV incidences were recorded weekly until flowering and the disease temporally and spatially analyzed. MSV disease progression over time was fitted by the Gompertz model. MSV spread based on Point pattern analysis revealed clustered patterns.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to prioritize subwatersheds using water quality data and watershed characteristics. Water quality data was provided through studies by the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission, Beaver Water District, Arkansas Water Resources Center, and publicly available USGS gage data. A total of 114 sites across five HUC-8 watersheds were analyzed, including 12 USGS gages. Watershed characteristic data was retrieved from USGS and Arkansas GeoStore geodatabase repositories. A significant linear relationship between baseflow and stormflow nutrient concentrations was established allowing for the use of baseflow concentrations in the prioritization methodology. Pearson correlation, linear regression, classification and regression tree, and change point analysis were used to study relationships between watershed characteristics and four constituents; nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus. Human disturbance of the landscape, particularly forested area and agricultural production in the riparian buffer were the most significantly correlated with nutrient concentrations. The density of poultry houses within the watershed as well as a combined human disturbance index were also significantly correlated to nutrient concentrations. These relationships were used to develop prioritization methodologies for HUC-12 subwatersheds, ranking them in order of predicted constituent concentration. The first method utilized percent forest within the riparian buffer to separate watersheds by the predicted change point in nutrient concentrations; ultimately, those exhibiting less than 50% forested buffer were identified as a priority. The second method also used significant change points to classify nutrient trends as either high or low, but included multiple metrics: agricultural land use in the riparian buffer, forested riparian buffer, human use index, and poultry house density. Subwatersheds were ranked higher in priority as they increased in the number of predictors indicating high nutrient concentrations. Finally, as a way to corroborate the results, analysis of variance was performed on subwatersheds identified as a priority versus those that were not using available water quality data. Priority subwatersheds contained significantly higher nutrient concentrations. Empirical watershed models and prioritization schemes such as this one may provide a viable alternative to extensive deterministic watershed modeling in watersheds lacking adequate water quality data.

AB  - Riparian zones serve to maintain high water quality, low water temperatures, and structural complexity in aquatic and terrestrial environments, among other beneficial services. Riparian buffers provide habitat and corridors linking forest patches for terrestrial wildlife. High riparian vegetative structure and complexity attract a high diversity of wildlife, including birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals. Devegetated riparian zones, often a result of developmental and agricultural practices, lose their beneficial functions and require restorative actions to regain them. The Cacapon River watershed in West Virginia is agriculturally-dominated with many areas of riparian zone degradation. A section of the Cacapon River was selected for natural stream channel design restoration during 2009 to 2011. Our objectives were to: (1) monitor birds, small mammals, anurans, and vegetation along the restoration reach, 2 control (impaired) sites, and 2 reference (unimpaired) sites following a before-after control-impact design along the Cacapon River; (2) survey natural history characteristics of wood turtles ( Glyptemys insculpta ) using the riparian zone along the Cacapon River; and (3) assess factors limiting wood turtles along the southern extent of their geographic range along the Lost and North rivers, tributaries of the Cacapon River. We expected (1) the diversity of the riparian wildlife to remain stable or increase post-restoration, (2) wood turtles to undergo all natural history aspects within the riparian zone, and (3) geographical and environmental features to limit wood turtles along the southern border of their range in the Cacapon River watershed. Monitoring of riparian wildlife along the Cacapon River occurred pre- (April 2009 to April 2010) and post-restoration (May 2010 to August 2011). Overall, 6 small mammal species, 79 bird species, 8 anuran species, and 96 plant species were recorded. Small mammal abundance declined initially in the restoration reach post-impact, but began to recover. Overall bird abundance, richness, and diversity increased along the restoration reach post-impact. The anurans were unaffected by the restoration activities, but showed species-specific timing of reproductive activities across the sites. Shrub and tree diversity, richness, and evenness increased over time, possibly indicating that the restoration reach began improving in vegetative complexity post-impact. The restoration was considered a success because the diversity of the riparian wildlife remained stable or increased post-restoration. Monitoring of wood turtles along the Cacapon River occurred during spring 2009 to summer 2011. The turtles were observed primarily using the riparian zone (80.7%) instead of the surrounding agricultural land (19.3%). Adult males and females were larger than juveniles. Reproductively active males were longer, thicker, and heavier than reproductively active females. Home ranges were 0.62 - 36.97 ha. Low bare ground and rock cover and high vertical density differentiated the turtles' habitat from random vegetation plots. The turtles were typically terrestrial during spring and summer and aquatic in autumn and winter. Mating occurred in autumn (64.3%) after 1300 hrs (75%), sometimes terrestrially (35.7%). Nesting attempts were made on sandy substrate in the early mornings and early evenings of spring. Basking occurred at 45°, angled to the sun, on a variety of surfaces. Dietary preference was for slugs (67%), although other invertebrates, plant matter, and animal matter were consumed. The riparian zone provided the wood turtles with all of their natural history needs. Monitoring of wood turtles along the Lost and North rivers in the Cacapon River watershed was conducted during summer 2010. Habitat characteristics, potential dispersal barriers, and the approximate southern geographic boundary of the species in the watershed were assessed. Sixty-four of 100 randomly-selected sites contained wood turtles. Increasing stream depth, canopy cover, soil te perature, and proximity to the Cacapon River, and low elevation and slope positively influenced presence of the turtles. Field layer (woody and herbaceous plants <1 m tall) species richness and diversity were greater in sites with wood turtles than without the turtles. Witch-hazel ( Hamamelis virginianus ) and ironwood (Ostrya virginiana ) weakly separated sites without turtles from sites with them. The factors limiting wood turtles at the southern limits of their range in West Virginia included (1) inability to disperse over high elevations, (2) agricultural influences decreasing habitat availability and turtle survivorship, and (3) an intolerance to high temperatures. In agricultural areas bordering waterways, riparian buffers should be restored if they are degraded, managed to promote structurally complex vegetation, and monitored to determine whether the buffers are providing essential habitat for a diverse array of terrestrial wildlife that should promote adult survivorship and population stability.

AB  - Stream ecosystems are holistic systems that incorporate disturbances and abiotic influences at many spatial and temporal scales. This view supports a three-tiered model of variables that determine biotic integrity in streams, with causes and effects flowing from large-scale to fine-scale processes. Tier One characteristics include variables important at the scale of geomorphological processes and land use over entire watersheds. These variables largely determine Tier Two factors, abiotic conditions in a stream reach. Tier Two variables, in turn, largely structure the Tier Three variables, the stream's biotic communities. Through field studies and GIS analysis, relationships among these three tiers of variables were examined in this research to explore the question of how agriculture exerts its influence on stream fishes. This study investigated 27 streams, in two ecoregions and the transition area, or ecotone, between them, in south-central Ohio. The study design allowed questions to be asked concerning the relative influence of geomorphology and land use in varied landscapes, as well as relative impacts of watershed versus riparian land use. The region also contained relatively equal proportions of three types of agriculture (hay, row crops, and pasture) allowing the study to address the question of which land use might be most harmful to stream fish. This study supported the importance of row crop agriculture, finding it to be the most degrading type of agriculture for stream fish, but also found pasture to be an important causal factor in stream community degradation. This study also supported the importance of riparian buffers, finding riparian agriculture to be more degrading than agriculture over the entire watershed. A more interesting finding is the suggestion that a minor amount of nutrient enrichment from agricultural land use may benefit streams that are naturally oligotrophic. A possible mechanism could be increased primary production, which increases macroinvertebrate density, and provides a larger food base for fishes. This study also reports the possible existence of a biodiversity "hotspot" in the transitional region between the two ecoregions. Some evidence exists that greater habitat heterogeneity increases species richness, suggesting a possible cause for higher biodiversity in this ecotonal region. Since habitat heterogeneity over whole streams was not measured in this study, both the existence and mechanism of such a hotspot needs more study. A final conclusion is that geomorphology and agricultural land use may be equally important in structuring stream conditions, and thus, biological stream communities. This study illustrates the difficulties associated with overlapping causes and effects in complex systems such as streams and their catchments. Several variables in the study reported here required examination at multiple scales and with multiple statistical techniques in order to understand relationships that varied across different regions. The effects of a particular agricultural variable were not always equal in the diverse landscapes of southern Ohio. Lotic ecologists must examine a variety of ecoregions, and incorporate a variety of scales with a variety of analytic tools, if predictive stream ecology is to become a reality.

Farmers routinely restore displaced topsoil, but failure to do so in the past has allowed colluvium to accumulate upslope of field banks and so-called 'colluvial steps' to develop. Steps are particularly common on sandy soils and short, steep slopes in mid-County Down. Many date from the late 1940s and 1950s, when there was widespread reversion to pasture. Fields in which steps occur provide an opportunity to assess the impact of erosion and burial on soil variation.Erosion results from saturation overland flow and from infiltration excess flow over surface compacted soil in furrows and tracks. Both types of flow are most effective in mid-slope and slope-foot zones although all parts of slopes are subject to erosion. Data from three field areas show downslope variations in soil organic carbon, pH, iron content, magnetic susceptibility and texture. Comparisons were made between surface and undisturbed sub-surface and underbank soils. Detailed examination of 121 downslope variations, using model catenary patterns as standards, suggests that while topsoil movement has little direct effect on variation in the measured properties, increased frequency of soil saturation following step formation either enhances redistribution of material or total removal from eroded fields. Localised leaching of colluvial steps also shows how altered moisture flow can affect soil properties, particularly pH, iron content and magnetic susceptibility. Topsoil movement therefore has a significant though conditional effect on soil variation and thereby on sub-surface denudation.

AB  - The reestablishment of the beaver, Castor canadensis, in Massachusetts reinstates an important source of disturbance within forest vegetation. Abandoned beaver meadows enhance environmental heterogeneity and provide potential habitat for rare and uncommon species. Nonetheless, the floristics and synecology of abandoned beaver meadows have been generally neglected. Fifteen abandoned western Massachusetts beaver meadows sharing similar area, elevation and surrounding forest type were sampled by means of line transects through four predetermined vegetation zones in order to define wetland, habitat and community types, their floristics and successional patterns. The zones were differentiated by relative percent cover of emergents, shrubs and trees. In addition, three sites sampled in 1980 were resampled in 1985 for comparative data. Field sites were classified either as fens, wet meadows or shrub swamps; most were wet meadows. Characteristic plant communities were noted in the following habitats: open water, mud flats, streambanks, hummock and hollows, the shrub zone and in the vicinities of beaver artifacts. Patterns of vegetational zonation were predominantly linear as opposed to concentric, as a result of persistent beaver artifacts, particularly dams. Herbaceous species exceeded woody species in the sites by 54% and the Cyperaceae, represented by 34 species, was the largest family. A total of 218 vascular species were collected. Seven species were present at all sites, usually in two or more zones, and frequently dominant. These constant species are not restricted to abandoned beaver meadows and hence are not "indicator species" per se: they form nonetheless a distinct assemblage to be expected elsewhere in equivalent sites. Species diversity was negatively correlated with increasing site age and positively correlated with the number of zones present. Mid-zones and mid-aged sites with the maximum number of zones had the greatest species diversity, supporting the "intermediate diversity hypothesis". Successional patterns varied within each site according to allogenic and autogenic factors. Fens and shrub swamps appeared to be relatively stable, while wet meadows generally appeared to be succeeding to shrub swamps.

AB  - Field research was conducted to investigate the impact of vegetative filter strips (VFSs) on surface runoff water quality and to determine if this impact decreases with time. The field research provided information for the development and testing of a model to describe the dynamics and fate of nitrogen (N) in VFSs. The experiment had a completely randomized design, with 3 treatments and 2 replicates per treatment. The treatments were 3 VFS lengths: 0, 4.27, and 8.5 m VFSs. The distribution free Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the runoff, TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN yields and concentrations from the 8.5 m VFSs were significantly less ($\alpha$ = 0.05) than the influent values. The TSS and NH$\sb4\sp+$-N yields and concentrations and the TKN concentration from the 4.27 m VFSs were significantly less than the influent yields and concentrations. The Mann-Kendall test indicated that the yields of TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN from the filters did not significantly increase from 1992 to 1993 and neither did the FTKN yield nor the FTKN concentration from the beginning to the end of 1993. The mean percentage reductions in influent runoff, TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN yields from the 8.5 m filters were 73, 91, 79, 86, and 83%, respectively. The mean percentage reductions in influent TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN concentrations from the 8.5 m filters were 88, 50, 66, and 75%. The mean percentage reductions in influent runoff, TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN yields from the 4.27 m filters were 43, 83, 55, 40, and 56%, respectively. The mean percentage reductions in influent TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-$-N, NH$\sb4\sp+$-N, and TKN concentrations from the 4.27 m filters were 81, 45, 26, and 41%. Based on the information gathered from the experiment results and the literature, a continuous, long-term, field scale model (Grass Filter Strip Model, GFSM) was developed to describe N transport and dynamics in VFSs. The model was based on GRAPH (GRAssed-strip-PHosphorus), a field scale, event-based model that describes sediment and P transport in runoff. The model simulates sediment, nitrate, sediment-bound and dissolved ammonium, and sediment-bound organic N transport during a runoff event. The model simulates the daily percolation and evapotranspiration and dynamics of nitrate, sediment-bound and dissolved ammonium, and sediment-bound organic N in the filter between runoff events. The model predicts the amount of N and sediment exiting the VFSs, and it can be used to estimate the site specific effectiveness and length of VFSs. The model can also be run for an event to assess the effectiveness of VFSs in reducing nonpoint source pollution loading from a single design storm. The model was validated using runoff, sediment, NO$\sb3\sp-,$ and NH$\sb4\sp+$ yield field data gathered from April to December, 1993. The model predicted reasonably well (within a factor of 2) the cumulative runoff volume and the yields of TSS, NO$\sb3\sp-,$ and NH$\sb4\sp+.$ The model was most sensitive to the runoff rate, depth of the EDI, soil water storage depth, field capacity, and the steady-state infiltration rates. The model was used to determine the minimum length of VFS required for a 1.3 ha field in Georgia to achieve 75% and 40% sediment and nutrient reductions, respectively, over a 10-year period. The model results indicated that a buffer length of 6.3 m was sufficient to reduce sediment and nitrogen losses by the specified percentages.

AB  - Streams and adjacent riparian zones are intimately linked by the flow of resource subsidies between terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Landscape-level changes in land use can have profound impacts on riparian structure and stream health, and may alter the flow of resource subsidies across the stream-riparian boundary. Yet, terrestrial-aquatic linkages have not been well-studied in human-impacted landscapes. Here, I examine energy flows across the stream-riparian boundary in agricultural and suburban landscapes in Maryland. I study the effects of terrestrial resource subsidies (grass and herbaceous vegetation, periodical cicada detritus) on stream ecosystem processes and consumers and the effects of one aquatic subsidy (emerging aquatic insects) on agriculturally important consumers, wolf spiders (Lycosidae). I present strong evidence for terrestrial-aquatic linkages where large quantities of high quality, allochthonous resources subsidize stream ecosystems. Herbaceous vegetation and grasses growing along the edges of agricultural headwater streams provide significant quantities of organic matter that are rapidly decomposed and support a diverse macroinvertebrate community. Further, the dense vegetation appears to limit light to algae growing on the stream bottom. Detritus from 17-year periodical cicadas ( Magicicada spp.) that falls into forested suburban streams provides an intense pulse of terrestrial resources that is unusual for the summer, but is locally utilized and causes dramatic increases in whole-stream community respiration. I provide weak evidence for a terrestrial-aquatic linkage between emerging aquatic insects and lycosid wolf spiders inhabiting agro-ecosystems in central Maryland. Results from field studies indicate that wolf spiders are generally more abundant in the riparian buffers adjacent to corn fields, and exhibit neither alternating abundance nor net movement between the field and buffer habitats throughout the year. While wolf spiders consume adult aquatic insects in the lab, I could not resolve the specific contribution aquatic insects make to the diets of field-collected wolf spiders. Terrestrial-aquatic linkages are important in human-altered ecosystems, and have significant implications for the conservation and restoration of impacted habitats and ecosystem services. The relative strength of these linkages, however, depends on the species involved, the direction of the subsidy flux, the nature of the land-water boundary, and the temporal context in which they occur.

AB  - Land use impacts nutrient export from catchments; in particular, agriculture is an important source of phosphorus (P) to many surface waters. However, the relationship between the different forms of phosphorus [i.e., total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)] and land use has rarely been evaluated. This thesis investigates the relationships between the forms of phosphorus and land use by evaluating water quality at nine headwater streams and three sites along the main channel of the Beaver River, a major inflow to Lake Simcoe. At the nine headwater sites, there was a negative relationship between TP and the percentage of wetland within catchments but, unexpectedly, there was no relationship between agricultural land use (pasture and row crops) and TP concentrations. However, at a smaller scale, an upstream-downstream comparison showed that TP as well as TDP and Chl a concentrations were higher at a predominantly agricultural (downstream) site compared to a site with natural heritage land use (wetland and woodlands) which is nested within the same sub-catchment. In contrast to TP, concentrations of SRP and TDP were positively correlated with both the percentage of total agriculture and the percentage of non-intensive agriculture at the nine headwater sites; however, relationships were strongly influenced by high SRP and TDP concentrations measured during the dormant season. The concentrations of TP and TDP were higher in the headwater streams compared with sites along the channel, and concentrations of both forms of phosphorus increased towards the outlet to Lake Simcoe. Land use did not influence the ratio of SRP to TP or TDP to TP which each varied from 0 to 0.95. A commonly-used indicator of P limitation, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), was not correlated with SRP but there was a weak negative correlation between Chl a and both SRP and TP. These results imply that APA and Chl a are not good measurements of productivity in streams. Overall, these results suggest that non-intensive agricultural land use has a greater impact on the forms of P in the Beaver River compared with intensive agriculture (row crops), and that manure application to snow during the dormant season is likely an important source of SRP during winter runoff events. Keywords: phosphorus, land use, runoff, headwater streams, Lake Simcoe, buffer zones, alkaline phosphatase activity, chlorophyll a , soluble reactive phosphorus.

AB  - Landscape-scale accumulations of skeletal material are untapped sources of multi-generational historical ecological data. Ten transects in each of four habitats (grasslands, forests, river-margins, and lake-margins) were used to survey the death assemblage of the well-studied large-mammal community of Yellowstone National Park (YNP), WY to test the fidelity of bone accumulations with respect to current and historical populations. In addition, characteristics of bone weathering in this cold, temperate climate were investigated through study of carcasses with known postmortem durations as well as AMS radiocarbon dating of bones found across the landscape. The geographic fidelity of the YNP death assemblage was also tested by comparing the geographic distributions of skeletal remains across the landscape to existing knowledge of habitat-use by elk. The YNP death assemblage captures the diversity of a majority of mammals larger than 1 kg including all native ungulates. Proportional abundances of species in the ungulate death assemblage accurately reflect ungulate community structure and are sensitive to changes in that structure over time. Bone weathering was discovered to be decadal to centennial in time scale, thus, bones in YNP represent significant numbers of generations of ecological insight and provide a rich historical perspective on the ungulate community. It was also established that concentrations of antlers and calf bones correctly demarcate bull elk wintering grounds and calving grounds, respectively. Thus, multigenerational biogeographic patterns can also be identified through investigation of death assemblages. Bone surveys provide quantitative historical data on terrestrial communities that are often otherwise unobtainable in poorly studied ecosystems and offer a new source of data to illuminate population variability over decadal- to centennial-timescales. A supplementary data file that includes the raw transect data collected for this study is digitally attached to this dissertation ("Miller_YNP_Appendix_A_2.csv").

AB  - Cryptosporidium spp. are protozoan parasites that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals, and are spread directly by fecal-oral transmission or indirectly by fecal contamination of water and food supplies. In California, there is evidence of significant fecal pathogen pollution flowing from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems along the coast. To develop ecosystem monitoring and management strategies, we tested the hypothesis that Cryptosporidum spp. are detectable in nearshore filter feeding bivalves and in terrestrial storm runoff collected from fecal-impacted coastal ecosystems in California. The goals of this dissertation research were (1) to evaluate innovative detection methods for Cryptosporidium spp. in bivalve and water samples, (2) to evaluate bivalves such as mussels and clams as bioindicators of fecal contamination with Cryptosporidium spp. in marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems, and (3) to evaluate farm management solutions to reduce the load of Cryptosporidium discharged into downstream waterways from coastal dairies. First, innovative molecular and immunologic methods were evaluated for detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in marine mussels (Mytilus californianus ) and freshwater clams ( Corbicula fluminea ) using tissue spiking and tank exposure experiments. The most analytically sensitive detection method was immunomagnetic separation in combination with immunofluorescent detection of oocysts in mussel digestive tissues. Second, field studies tested 4800 mussels and 600 clams from marine, estuarine, and riverine ecosystems along the California coast for Cryptosporidium spp. Genotypes detected in bivalves included the anthropozoonotic C. parvum genotype 2, as well as the host specific C. andersoni and C. felis that are shed by cattle and cats, respectively. In addition, 2 novel Cryptosporidium genotypes were detected in mussels. Third, a 3-year study evaluated the distribution of Cryptosporidium on coastal dairies and the efficacy of various farm management practices to reduce the load of Cryptosporidium oocysts in storm runoff. Calves were found to be important loading sources of Cryptosporidium on the farms, and vegetative buffers were found to effectively reduce the load of Cryptosporidium oocysts in storm runoff. In conclusion, Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in terrestrial runoff and nearshore bivalves, suggesting that Cryptosporidium spp. will be useful bioindicators of fecal contamination in ecosystem monitoring and management programs.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) lost from agricultural soils in the forms of nitrate (NO 3 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) have become major environmental concerns. Because N cycling is coupled with organic carbon (C) cycling, management practices that influence soil organic C inputs and cycling may affect reactive N losses. Management practices have been proposed to reduce N losses, including perennial vegetation buffers (PVB) and overwintering non-legume cover crops. However, the effects of these practices on N losses depend on the biogeochemical interactions between soil N and C cycling. This thesis presents investigations of the effects of these management practices on NO 3 and N 2 O losses from row crop systems in Iowa, USA. In PVBs, soil organic matter and plant biomass acted as sinks for NO3 inputs. However, denitrification, stimulated by organic C inputs from perennial vegetation, appeared to be the most important NO3 sink. These results indicate that integration of perennial vegetation into agricultural landscapes can return substantial amounts of N to the atmosphere and decrease watershed NO 3 losses in the long term. The effects of cover crops on N2 O emissions were found to vary with N fertilizer rate, and cover crops increased N2 O emissions at an economical N rate. These results indicate that overwintering cover crops should not be expected to consistently decrease N2 O emissions from agricultural soils, even when they do decrease NO3 availability for denitrification. In row crop systems with PVBs and cover crops, mineralizable C inputs to soils are a key factor influencing the biogeochemical N transformations that lead to N retention or losses. Considering the interactions between C and N cycling in agricultural soils is necessary to understand and predict the effects of management practices on environmental N losses.

AB  - This study has measured the main nitrogen transformation processes occurring within potential riparian buffer zone locations along the River Torridge in north-west Devon. It was found that plant uptake of available nitrogen was the main process responsible for amelioration of nitrate levels in the riparian habitats studied, but that this is only a storage, or retention, mechanisms, rather than a permanent removal process. The only permanent removal of nitrate occurs through the process of denitrification and this was found to be an order of magnitude lower than plant uptake in the growing season.This study also highlighted the principal problem with the use of riparian buffer zones to solve the nitrate pollution problem in the UK. The agricultural landscape is highly dissected by ditches and field drains and these bypass the traditional riparian strip so that this strip is unable to buffer nitrate effectively. This was observed to be occurring at one of the sites under examination, Kismeldon Meadows. The presence of ditches may not, however, be as deleterious as it may first appear; in some circumstances the ditches themselves may be utilised as non-riparian buffers. The ditches at Kismeldon Meadows were found to be highly effective nitrate buffers, removing up to 99% of the nitrate entering the field site from agriculturally-intensified land upslope, by a combination of biological and physical processes.Denitrification was considered in depth in this study as it is the only permanent means of removing nitrate. Denitrification rates were found to be highly variable, both temporally and spatially, and to be affected by a large number of soil variables. The siting of nitrate buffer zones to enhance the permanent removal of nitrate is difficult; an attempt to develop a predictive system for denitrification found that less than 40% of the variation in denitrification could be accounted for by the variation in the factors affecting it, primarily due to the large number of inter-relationships between these factors themselves.

AB  - Cropland runoff from manure applied fields and runoff from manure storage facilities may contribute significantly to bacterial contamination of streams and other surface water bodies in Ontario. Vegetative Filter Strips (VFS) are used to intercept the bacteria reaching surface water bodies. In this study a component for the transport of bacteria ( E.coli ) through the VFS has been incorporated into the Guelph Design tool for VFS (GDVFS) model. Experiments were conducted to develop the partition coefficient for E.coli. Processes simulated in the transport of free floating and particulate bacteria include infiltration, deposition, adsorption to vegetation and resuspension. Sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation of the model were performed using the data collected from the experiments. The model was found sensitive to the initial soil moisture content and performed better for free floating rather than for particulate bacteria. The incorporation of the bacteria component has increased the capability of the GDVFS in designing the VFS.

AB  - The impact of riparian buffers on salmonid habitat in lowland agricultural streams is not well understood. This study consists of three parts: the first describes the water quality of agricultural streams in row-crop and pasture areas; the second examines instream temperature among streams with different buffer widths; and the third investigates nitrogen transformation in riparian buffers using push-pull nitrate injections. Grab samples were taken on a monthly basis during May-October of 2001, 2002 and 2003 from streams in row-crop and pasture areas. Row-crop streams had significantly higher concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium, organic nitrogen, and total phosphorus than pasture streams without buffers. Large buffers composed of red alder ( Alnus rubra ) in pasture areas had significantly higher concentrations of nitrate than small (12m) buffer and conifer-dominated streams (p < 0.1). To investigate instream temperatures the average water temperature at 4:00 pm on Mondays was used to compare different groups of streams. The most significant environmental drivers affecting instream temperatures were buffer width and density (p = 0.022, df = 10). The number of days that the daily maximum instream temperature exceeded state water quality standards, the average length of time that instream temperatures were above standard, and the range of temperature fluctuation were summarized. Streams would stay above 16°C from 8-22h on average and average diurnal temperature ranges were from 0.8-6°C. Push-pull injections of nitrate into shallow subsurface wells were used to determine the rate of nitrogen loss in a riparian area dominated by red alder to an area without a buffer. The non-buffer site demonstrated similar nitrate loss rates in both July and December (average 0.068 mg·L -1 ·h-1 ). The buffered site had high dispersion rates and showed dramatic differences in July (dispersion rate 0.002 mg/L/hr, nitrate loss rate 0.055 mg·L-1 ·h -1 ) and December (dispersion rate 0.01mg/L/hr, nitrate loss rate 0 mg·L-1 ·h-1 ). Production of nitrous oxide in the presence of co-injected acetylene suggests that the observed nitrate loss was partially due to microbial denitrification. Riparian buffers along northwest agricultural streams should be studied independently prior to prescribing buffer widths for water quality parameters because of the unique biochemical cycling of nitrogen and subsurface environment.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem management requires that management prescriptions account for economic and environmental goals that are measured in non-commensurate units. This study examines the economic and environmental trade-offs associated with planting a riparian buffer in trees to reduce stream temperatures in the Mohawk watershed, Oregon. The detrimental effects of high stream temperatures on fish production and survival have received increasing attention from State and Federal agencies. The cost and effectiveness of five riparian buffer scenarios and three tax policies are identified and used to construct a cost-effectiveness frontier. Specifically the study: (i) empirically estimates total welfare changes and their distribution among Mohawk residents; (ii) identifies the effectiveness of alternative buffer prescriptions and (iii) identifies cost-effective policy scenarios. The study adopts a welfare theory framework to examine welfare changes among producers and residential property owners. A mathematical programming model is used to generate empirical estimates of welfare change. The model has two interesting features, (i) a hedonic pricing analysis is used to generate coefficients which determine how residential property prices change in response to riparian plantings and (ii) buffer prescriptions are linked to a stream temperature estimator, Heat Source, to estimate changes in stream temperature. Data for the model are collected using a Geographical Information System, personal interview survey, aerial photograph interpretation, enterprise budgets and other sources. Results indicate that riparian buffers are effective in achieving some reductions in stream temperature. The total cost and distribution of welfare changes across sectors differs between scenarios. Under the efficient scenarios welfare increases in the agricultural sector, decreases in the forestry sector and residential welfare both increases and decreases depending on the scenario. In general, the least efficient agricultural producers will receive the greatest benefits from the proposed scenarios. A progressively wider riparian buffer results in residential property owners bearing a greater percentage of welfare loss. From a policy perspective the efficient scenarios reduce stream temperatures at the expense of collected tax revenues which may affect individuals outside the study area. The choice of which policy to choose from the frontier may differ depending on whether riparian plantings are voluntary or mandatory.

AB  - Our first objective was to develop suitable construction site parameters for the validated WEPP erosion prediction model. Predicted values were correlated with field observations for runoff and sediment yield. Runoff volumes and sediment yields similar to those measured on an active construction site were achieved by removing the A horizon from the soil input parameter and applying a landcover parameter with no ground cover and minimal roughness. Increasing critical shear stress to 384 Pa (as recommended by an erosion mat manufacturer) efficiently predicted runoff volume (E = 0.66) and sediment yield (E = 0.57) when compared to a construction site stabilized with straw, tar and erosion blankets. Our second and third objectives were to use to evaluate state-approved sediment traps and riparian buffers with WEPP and GeoWEPP, and to create erosion and sediment control scenarios that would achieve the NC water quality standard of 50 Nephlometric Turbidity Units. Two sediment traps on an actual school construction site were modeled with WEPP, and a 15.2 m width forest buffer on a planned golf course site was modeled with GeoWEPP. WEPP predicted average trapping efficiencies of sediment traps A and B to meet the NC standard of 70% trapping efficiency. WEPP predicted runoff from sediment trap B met the turbidity standard for 11% of the modeled storm events. GeoWEPP predicted that the riparian buffers would not meet the turbidity standard for any of the modeled storm events. The existing sediment controls were adjusted to meet water quality standards by increasing sediment trap size, replacing free-draining traps rock outlets with standing pools behind culvert outlets, extending the riparian buffer, and adding vegetation to highly erosive areas determined by GeoWEPP. Turbidity standards were met on watershed A by removing the outlet from the second sediment trap and increasing the trap area 6-fold. WEPP and GeoWEPP are useful for modeling construction sites and for designing erosion control scenarios, although the new parameters and the GeoWEPP model will need to be validated on other construction sites to improve confidence in the model output.

AB  - Grass buffer strips are commonly deployed along crop borders in North American agricultural landscapes. Such borders filter nutrient and pesticide runoff to neighboring habitats and foster biodiversity. The addition of wildflowers in these strips to provide nectar and pollen resources can positively impact natural enemies of crop pests, particularly hymenopteran parasitoids. I investigated the presence/absence of wildflowers on natural enemy abundance in buffer strips and in neighboring soybean fields in 2005 and 2006. I predicted that wildflowers would attract and act as a source of natural enemies which would then disperse into neighboring crop fields. In both years, sticky cards were used to measure the abundance of aerial arthropods in pure stands of wildflowers and in neighboring soybean plots. Pitfall traps were also used in 2006 to measure abundance of epigeal taxa. In the 2005 experiment, sticky card captures of hymenopteran and dipteran parasitoids were 72.7% higher in buffers containing partridge pea compared to the other buffer types. Similarly, communities of all beneficial arthropods captured by sticky card and pitfall traps in 2006 were significantly 79.8% to 72.3 % higher, respectively, in the partridge pea buffers compared to communities in the soybean crop. However, buffer effects on populations of parasitoids and predators in the neighboring crop were mixed in both experiments depending on the particular functional group and specific family of arthropods. Results suggest that partridge pea was a source for canopy-dwelling dipteran parasitoids and saprovores, but acted as a sink for canopy-dwelling mymarids, canopy-dwelling predators and ground-dwelling ants, and had a neutral effect on all others. However, these effects did not extend far into the soybean crop and were generally not discernible beyond 6m. This study provides evidence that a pure stand of an attractive source of floral resources in a bordering non-crop area may not be desirable for enhancing conservation biological control. The species of flower and desired natural enemy should be taken into consideration before determining the mix of plant species to include in a buffer strip.

AB  - The purpose of this research has been to assess the role of economic incentives in producers' decisions to adopt naturally-vegetated field borders in eastern North Carolina. This work has identified barriers to producer adoption of field borders on farms, quantified the opportunity costs of field borders in two distinct agronomic regions, determined hunter willingness-to-pay for wild quail hunting opportunities, and conducted a qualitative evaluation of the necessity and sufficiency of these findings as economic incentives to motivate producer adoption of field borders on their farms. Major barriers to producer adoption included uncertainty regarding field border generation of environmental benefits, the opportunity costs in foregone crop production and the impact of field border vegetation on adjacent crop yields. The opportunity costs of field borders in foregone corn and soybeans were lowest on corn field edges in Wilson County, in the upper coastal plain, especially those next to wooded areas where corn production was often unprofitable. Hunters' willingness-to-pay for wild quail hunting opportunities were sufficient to make field borders economically viable on some profitably farmed areas as well. Qualitative evaluation of these findings as economic incentives for producer adoption of field borders found the adoption decision process of producers to be more complex in the upper than in the lower coastal plain. Increased competition for farmland and recreational hunting opportunities in upper coastal plain communities accounted for these differences.

AB  - Asparagus is globally in decline due partially to increased pest prevalence. One of the main pests is the asparagus miner, a stem-mining fly, that may spread pathogenic fungi (Fusarium spp. ). Because conventional pesticides are not sufficient in controlling the asparagus miner, an integrated management program needs to be developed to aid asparagus growers. This dissertation evaluates three different aspects of plant-insect interactions in asparagus fields in order to lay the basis for an IPM program for the miner. These include 1) developing a degree-day model and elucidating the spatial distribution of the asparagus miner within a field so growers can accurately time and place insecticides to achieve increased levels of control with decreased ecological and monetary costs; 2) investigating the natural enemy community of the asparagus miner to lay a foundation for a conservation biological control program; and 3) exploring the chemical ecology of asparagus and its interactions with its arthropod community in order to probe the potential for the use of plant volatiles in IPM. For the first objective, sticky traps were deployed from 2010-2012 at multiple distances into 3-5 commercial fields, and the abundance of miner adults was counted weekly. In addition, the lower developmental threshold for the miner pupae was assessed through environmental chambers set to 10 different temperatures to inform the DD model. Asparagus miner adults were uniformly distributed throughout the field during their first generation, whereas they were primarily clustered around the edges of the field during the second generation. Adults were greatest on field edges bordered by neighboring asparagus, while the lowest abundance was found on edges bordered by forests. The lower developmental threshold for the miner was 12.1$deg;C, and DDs reliably predicted important phenological events in the life cycle of the asparagus miner when using a biofix date of March 1. These results indicate that the conservation of the remaining forested habitats may be beneficial for pest mitigation and that growers may concentrate their insecticide sprays around the edges of asparagus fields during the second generation of the asparagus miner. For the second objective, we sampled for asparagus miner pupal parasitoids from 2010-2013. There were 12 parasitic wasps that used the asparagus miner as a host. Of these, Chorebus rondanii and Thinodytes cephalon were good candidates for biological control. From rearing on artificial diets, sugar-rich resources increased both the lifespan of miner adults and its parasitoids. Rearing on various flowering plants significantly impacted the lifespan of asparagus miner adults, with buckwheat and fava bean being unfavorable resources. This research lays the groundwork for a biocontrol program. For the third objective, asparagus headspace was significantly altered both quantitatively and qualitatively, depending on damage. The main component in all headspace blends, regardless of treatment was 3E-hexenyl acetate. Asparagus miner adults significantly preferred healthy asparagus stem blends over purified air, and preferred asparagus miner-damaged blends in the presence of healthy asparagus. Finally, in the field, the asparagus miner and parasitoids were most attracted to methyl salicylate-containing baits, while other pests were most attracted to cis-3-hexen-1-ol. Consequently, these compounds should not be used in asparagus fields. Future evaluation of the volatiles identified from asparagus headspace in this study should help illuminate those with biological activity for use in an IPM program for the miner. Overall, the results from this study are expected to significantly contribute to the IPM of the asparagus miner, and give growers alternative tactics for suppressing this important pest.

AB  - The environmental fate and leaching of phosphorus (P) in poultry manure (PM) amended soils of Delaware's Inland Bays' watershed were investigated in three studies. The first study concentrated on P availability and sorption. The mean soil test P (STP) value for 48 sites with a history of manure application was 128 mg/kg, relative to a high STP of 30 mg/kg for most agronomic crops. These STP values indicate that manure will cause the accumulation of excessive amounts of P in the agricultural soils. Phosphorus sorption maxima were 95-2564 mg/kg in agricultural fields and 200-2000 mg/kg of P in field borders and were well correlated with soil clay content and a readily measured P sorption index. This suggests estimates of P sorption capacity can easily be obtained and used to identify soils more resistant to P leaching. The second study focused on the release of P from freshly manured soils. Less than 1% of the total P in PM was released as soluble P from three manured A$\rm\sb{p}$ horizons during a 120 day leached incubation study. However the amount of initial soluble P released was up to three times higher than the cumulative amount of net soluble P released from the insoluble fraction. Application of PM significantly increased the total inorganic P and STP. Eighty three percent of the increase in total inorganic P was in chemical fractions that are known to be biologically available. In the third study, the leaching of soluble P from three manured soils was investigated. Column studies indicated that 94% of the soluble P in the PM leached from the manure and that 44% and 15% of this P leached from the A$\rm\sb{p}$ horizons; less than 1% leached from a B$\rm\sb{t}$ horizon. Column studies with the entire profiles of the same soils indicated that most (greater than 98%) of the manure P that infiltrated into the soil was sorbed by the three soil profiles. However, P concentrations as high as 0.6 mg/L were found in the leachate from manured soils relative to the critical P concentration of 0.03 mg/L for the eutrophication of P limited surface waters.

AB  - In recent decades the proportion of agricultural land in the UK and Europe under organic management, or other low-input forms of agriculture, has risen sharply. Conventional, intensive, agriculture employs techniques which have been shown to be detrimental to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, such as ploughing, fertilisation, pesticide application, and the growth of non-host crops. The impacts of low-input agriculture on arbuscular mycorrhiza and their functioning have been little studied, and this thesis examines the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from land under different agricultural management regimes. Using radioisotope labelling, it was found that phosphorus transfer through AMF hyphae to plants was far higher in turfs from organic pasture than from conventional pasture, integrated wheat fields or conventional wheat fields: 60 days after labelling the mean hyphal uptake of 33P was over 14 times greater in shoots from the organic pasture than in any of the other management treatments. Further experiments using turfs from organic and conventional fields and their margins showed a trend of decreased AMF hyphal phosphorus transfer to plants in conventional than organic farmland, and in fields compared to field margins. This trend was reversed for the 14C-carbon transfer from shoots to AMF hyphal compartments. Hyphal respiration of 14CO2 was 25% greater in turfs from conventional than organic fields. Using the ratio of hyphal carbon transfer to hyphal phosphorus transfer to infer the degree of mutualism of the AMF present, it was shown that AMF in land under organic management were significantly more mutualistic than those in land under conventional management, but that there was no significant effect of whether the turf was from a field or a field margin. These results confirm the major detrimental impacts of conventional farming practices upon AMF, and that organic management has a lower impact upon AMF functioning.

AB  - Viral diseases have increased in commercially grown crops in the Midwest United States since the recent establishment of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. In Wisconsin, Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) are two nonpersistently-transmitted viruses frequently detected in infected snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris ). Many factors, such as frequent aphid infestations, significant reservoirs of virus inoculum, and the introduction of new cultivars, may all have attributed to this increase. A. glycines transmits viruses in many economically important crops and is suspected of contributing to current disease outbreaks in snap bean. In lab and field studies, we demonstrated that A. glycines visits non-host plants like snap bean, and is the most abundant (52% of total aphid catches) species across the agricultural landscape. Peak A. glycines activity occurred briefly (July 24 to August 11) in the summer season and coincided with the onset of disease, which further suggests A. glycines is a likely vector of snap bean viruses. Plants along unmanaged field margins bordering commercial crops could serve as reservoirs of AMV and CMV that, via vectors like A. glycines , infects snap bean. In 2006 to 2008, a Wisconsin virus survey was conducted to develop a virus inoculum potential (VIP) index and classified alfalfa (Medicago sativa ) and milkweed ( Asclepias syriaca ) with the greatest risk as local reservoirs of AMV and CMV, respectively. Viral seed transmission is another potential source of primary inoculum for aphid vectors to acquire and transmit to healthy bean. Evaluation of field-collected isolates showed that AMV and CMV are transmissible through snap bean seed at rates of 0.7% and 0.5%, in the greenhouse, and 1.8% and 0.6%, under field conditions, respectively. Successful aphid transmission of nonpersistent viruses requires specific interactions between virus, host, and aphid vector. Our research showed that aphids differed in their ability to transmit field isolates of AMV and CMV to snap bean. The soybean aphid, however, was most capable and, based on its abundance in the landscape, plays an important role in snap bean virus epidemiology.

AB  - Declining crop yields, consequent to continuous cropping without external addition of adequate nutrients, is a major problem facing smallholder farmers in the tropics. The high cost of inorganic fertilizers has led to increased interest in the use of leafy biomass from woody species as a source of nutrients to crops. This dissertation embodies the results of a study conducted in the subhumid highlands of Kenya on the influence of soil-incorporated leafy biomass of two agroforestry tree species (calliandra and leucaena) on maize yield and soil fertility. The results revealed that inclusion of leucaena as hedgerows in crop fields (alley cropping) increased crop yields during the four-year study-period, whereas alley cropping with calliandra had an adverse effect. In maize fields, soil incorporation of leafy biomass obtained from trees grown outside the field, improved crop yield and decreased the rate of soil nutrient depletion. However, the applied biomass contributed more to long-term build up of soil nutrient status than to meeting the nutrient requirements of the current season's crop.

AB  - The banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham, is a serious pest of sunflower. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine if banded sunflower moth (BSM) eggs can be accurately counted in the field; (2) to develop a survey technique to estimate BSM egg numbers; (3) to describe the relationship between BSM egg counts and total seed weight per plant, seed number per plant, oil content, and head area; and (4) to develop an economic injury level (EIL) measured as numbers of BSM eggs. A technique using head-mounted 3.5X magnification that accurately counts the number of BSM eggs on six bracts from a sunflower bud was developed. Sampling six bracts from five buds at plant stage R3 at 6m from the field margin in the center of each 400m section of field edge accurately estimated the BSM egg population within that span. The weight loss per BSM egg ranged between 0.29g and 0.59g per plant over a two-year period. The two-year results were averaged to develop a BSM EIL given below. [Special characters omitted.] Plant Population per hectare, TC = Treatment Cost per hectare, and 0.00044 is a combined term representing the average weight loss and a treatment efficacy of 0.8. The relationship between numbers of eggs sampled at sites along field margins and points at variable distances into the field from that site is: EggsD = [1.29 - 0.194 ln(D)] x E; where D is distance into the field and E is the average BSM egg count from five buds at the 6m sample site. If a sample point is above the EIL, the extent of the EIL from the field edge into the field or the economic distance can be determined. Economic distance (ED) can be derived by rearranging the above formula and solving for the natural anti-logarithm of D. [Special characters omitted.] By calculating the EIL and ED, fields can be diagramed to show the extent of expected BSM damage and chemical applications can be restricted to those areas. This will reduce the cost of insect management, reduce the possibility of insecticide resistance in the BSM, and protect biodiversity.

AB  - Alley cropping of leucaena with maize and Napier grass was examined as a basis of low-input farming, particularly for milk production, on an infertile sandy soil in lowland coastal Kenya. Treatments also included mulching with leucaena foliage, return of slurry and intercropping with cowpea in maize and with Clitoria ternatea in Napier grass. The presence of leucaena hedgerows caused some depression of maize yield but had less effect on Napier production. Mulching, slurry and intercropping all increased yields some substantially. At most harvests, the more severe of two Napier cutting measurements gave the greater yield. Compared with sole maize, the hedgerow treatment receiving half rate mulch plus slurry increased yield by an average of 33&#37 in three crops. Compared with sole Napier the hedgerow treatment receiving slurry increased total Napier yield by 54&#37 and total forage by 90&#37. Total nitrogen was increased by 200&#37 over two harvests. Intercropping with cowpea in maize and intercropping with clitoria in Napier grass are the two treatments that stand out because besides increasing either the yield of the companion crops or total yield, their labour requirement was low compared to that of hedgerows, mulching or slurry handling.

AB  - Field research was conducted to monitor the dissipation of flumetsulam in five Mississippi soils. Predicted half-lived ranged from 20 to 26 days in 1994 and 23 to 46 days in 1995. Flumetsulam persistence increased with increasing organic matter content and decreasing rainfall. Soil pH had little effect on persistence. Research was conducted to evaluate the mobility of flumetsulam at the field level across three Mississippi soils. Mobility was monitored to a depth of 122 cm at 28, 56, and 84 days after treatment. Following a preemergence application of flumetaulam, mobility was primarily limited to the surface 8 cm of soil, regardless of soil type, year, or time. Results from this research suggest that leaching ie not a significant route of flumetsulam dissipation at the field level. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate flumetaulam adsorption and mobility in seven Mississippi soils of varied organic matter content and pH. Mobility was examined using packed soil columns. $\sp{14}$C-flumeteulam recovery in leachate ranged from 1 to 70%, and increased with increasing organic matter content and decreasing soil pH. A 2-year field study was initiated in 1994 near Brooksville, MS on a silty clay soil to evaluate the effects of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) filter stripe of 0, 0.5, and 1 m widths on fluometuron and norflurazon loss in surface runoff from conventionally-tilled cotton. Across years, fluometuron and norflurazon losses from the unfiltered treatment averaged 10 and 9% of the total amount applied, respectively. When compared to the unfiltered treatment, the 0.5 and 1 m filter strips reduced fluometuron and norflurazon loss by an average of 48 and 50%, respectively. Increasing filter strip width reduced both fluometuron and norflurazon concentrations in runoff. However, the increased efficiency of the 1 m filter strip came at the expense of higher runoff for that treatment. Consequently, there were no differences in cumulative fluometuron and norflurazon losses among the 0.5 and 1 m filter strip.

AB  - The impact of coniferous monocultures on stream hydrochemistry, particularly pH and related aluminium concentrations, has been the focus of much research. However conifer plantations can potentially influence the energy supply riparian zone. Of specific concern in this study was the manner in which streams with coniferous riparian zones differ from those with mixed deciduous riparian vegetation. The characteristics of the detritivore assemblages of such streams were investigated. Initially the seasonal variation in suspended detritus in two streams of contrasting riparian vegetation was monitored using regularly emptied detritus traps. The stream flowing through the conifer plantation (Streamhill West) carried significantly lower concentrations of detritus than the deciduous stream (Glenfinnish R.). Woody fragments made the greatest annual contribution to detrital mass in both streams. In the coniferous stream, willow and birch were the only abundant deciduous leaves. Conifer needles, grasses and coarse particulate organic matter &#62; 1 mm were also consistently present in the stream. In the deciduous stream, leaves dominated the non-woody detritus throughout the year, particularly oak, hazel, beech, birch and willow. During the summer, holly and coarse particulate organic mater &#62; 1 mm were the most important fraction. This study found definite differences between the macroinvertebrate assemblages of the coniferous and deciduous streams. However the influence of stream hydrochemistry and land-use history at both sites complicate the question of whether the conifer plantations are having a deleterious impact on the stream macroinvertebrates.

AB  - This thesis investigates nesting success, foraging behaviour, chick diet and growth of three ecologically contrasting species (skylark Alauda arvensis, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and song thrush Turdus philomelos) on farmland, in relation to microhabitat and the availability of invertebrates. Fieldwork was conducted on a lowland mixed arable farm in Leicestershire over the breeding seasons 2000 - 2002. Telemetry was used to monitor adult song thrushes and fledging skylarks. Skylark nest density was highest in set-aside and lowest in crops, yellowhammer nest density was greatest in herbaceous vegetation and field margins whilst song thrush nest density was greatest in hedgerows and woodland. Birds did not utilise the available habitat at random for nesting. Provisioning skylarks and yellowhammers utilised managed set-aside strips more than would be expected, although both forward in cereals. Song thrushes foraged primarily in woodland and boundary habitats, avoiding cereal crops, permanent pasture and set-aside. The largest cause of nest failure for each study species was predation. Skylark nest survival improved with increasing vegetation density at the nest site. Yellowhammer nest survival was affected by temperature and rainfall. Song thrush nest survival was affected by predator control, nest site location on the farm and habitat. Skylarks selected sparse vegetation and bare ground when foraging in winter cereals. Each species selected some invertebrate taxa over others, independently of chick age. Skylarks and yellowhammers did not forage in sites with greater invertebrate abundance than others, but son thrushes tended to forage in habitats with higher invertebrate biomass. Skylark chick growth rates were positively influenced by set-aside and negatively by spiders in the diet and the proportion of 'other habitats' around the nest. Skylark chicks with higher growth rates were more likely to fledge. No habitat effects or environmental factors were found to affect song thrush chick growth rates. Tagged skylark chicks exhibited a low post-fledgling survival rate, with most predated whilst flightless. This thesis identified actual and potential conservation benefits for nationally declining skylark, yellowhammer and song thrush populations arising from the management of cropped and non-cropped habitats.

AB  - Biological assemblages of streams integrate environmental conditions over space and time, and have been widely used to assess stream condition. Assemblage information can also be valuable in diagnosing sources of degradation. This dissertation links the vast information available in macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages of Hudson and Delaware River Basin streams to environmental conditions at several scales. The goals are to (1) diagnose sources of disturbance, (2) assess stream condition, and (3) determine urbanization-related landscape characteristics that affect stream condition. New York State uses an Impact Source Determination method (ISD) to identify point and nonpoint sources of impacts to stream water quality on the basis of benthic macroinvertebrates. The ISD was calculated for 26 stream sites in the Hudson River Basin. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed to relate macroinvertebrate assemblage structure to chemical and physical conditions of the sites. ISD classifications for most sites agreed with impairment sources inferred from these results. Fish assemblage data were used to calculate Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) scores for 27 sites. This IBI for northern mid-Atlantic drainages was evaluated against chemical and physical stream characteristics, macroinvertebrate metrics, and land use. An environmental gradient was established by ordination of chemical and habitat variables. Decreasing IBI scores were related to declining environmental quality, and loss of sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa. The modified IBI appears to be sensitive to environmental degradation of streams in the northern mid-Atlantic slope drainages. Ordination of stream macroinvertebrate taxa relative abundances was used to establish a disturbance gradient associated with urban intensity for 42 streams in the Delaware River Basin. Regression models explained up to 78 percent of the variation in disturbance score (ordination axis score). Results suggest that the influence of urban-impervious cover in stream catchments can be offset by planning and management practices that retain forested riparian buffers, limit the replacement of tree cover by grass cover in urban areas, and limit forest fragmentation. Key words . biological integrity, Delaware River basin, fish assemblage, forest fragmentation, Hudson River basin, landscape ecology, macroinvertebrate, source determination, urbanization, water quality

AB  - Development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for critical pollutants in impaired watersheds is becoming a standard approach in environmental management. This requires the identification of future loading of contributing pollutants, and the development of a plan to allocate the necessary reductions among the point and nonpoint sources in the watershed to achieve this loading. To support water quality model-based TMDL development, US EPA has released the modeling framework BASINS-Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Source, which incorporates several watershed water quality models within a GIS-based data management system. Current capabilities of BASINS enable simulation of watershed water quality associated with a TMDL, thus supporting TMDL development via a trial-and-error approach. The limitations of the trial-and-error approach are addressed via systematic search procedures implemented within the Water Quality Management Decision Support System (WQMDSS) that is designed to aid stakeholders and decision-makers efficiently identify TMDLs. The focus of the research presented in this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of WQMDSS in developing TMDLs for a realistic illustrative case study. Using the data for the Suwanee Creek Watershed in Georgia, which underwent a recent TMDL study, a series of illustrative scenarios are examined to consider varying target total suspended solids (TSS) loading rates, as well as different instream water quality parameters. The instream water quality is estimated using a calibrated HSPF model. Future land use development plans, with and without consideration of riparian buffer strips for nonpoint source control, to meet instream water quality goals are identified. Through this illustrative study, a range of uses of WQMDSS in watershed-scale TMDL development is demonstrated.

AB  - The implementation of riparian buffer guidelines is currently under review and partial-harvest logging is being considered as an alternative riparian management strategy. This thesis is an investigation of the input and decomposition rates of leaves within small headwater streams of Boreal Shield (mixedwood) forests. The goals of this thesis were (1) to provide information on the inputs of litter to Boreal Shield streams to determine if partial-harvest logging of commercial trees within riparian reserves has the potential to cause significant changes to litter inputs and (2) to measure the decomposition rates of alder, birch and poplar leaves and associated macroinvertebrate communities within undisturbed Boreal Shield streams. Commercial deciduous tree species and understorey species were important to these small streams as they each accounted for approximately 50% of the total inputs of deciduous litter. Distance-weighted deciduous basal area was the best predictor of overstory deciduous litter (r 2 = 0.597, p = <0.001), indicating that the size, abundance and proximity of deciduous trees to streams are important to the inputs of deciduous litter. The inputs of leaf litter to Boreal Shield streams can be effectively predicted by stem basal area. A linear regression model based on the basal area of deciduous tree is presented that can be useful to determine how many deciduous trees to retain within a riparian area to maintain the inputs of leaf litter at or near pre-harvest levels. The rate of decomposition (k/day) of the three leaf species in coarse-mesh leaf packs suggests that a processing continuum exists in Boreal Shield streams throughout winter, where alder and birch were medium decomposing species (k = 0.0063 and 0.0053/d, respectively) and poplar decomposed more slowly (k = 0.0032/d). Birch decomposed faster in fine-mesh leaf packs. Macroinvertebrate communities on coarse-mesh leaf packs were significantly different between fall and spring collection dates regardless of leaf species. Birch leaf packs supported a higher density (individuals/g of leaves) of invertebrates in the fall while poplar supported greater shredder abundances (individuals/coarse-mesh leaf pack) in the spring. The research shows that overstory and understorey deciduous riparian vegetation are equally important to leaf litter inputs to streams and that the diversity of leaves entering streams may be important in providing a sustained source of available leaf material to aquatic invertebrates. Careful consideration should be taken to maintain the inputs of leaf litter from overstory deciduous trees in the event of partial harvesting in the riparian area and to ensure that the species richness of leaf litter from deciduous trees is not altered as a result of the removal of specific commercial tree species from the riparian area.

AB  - This thesis explores the concept of resilience of farmers and agroecosystems to climate shocks and stresses. The objectives were (1) to identify weather-related shocks and stresses that Manitoba farmers have experienced over the past five years; (2) to determine how farmers have responded to these events, and (3) what can be learned from these responses to build resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The work was based on 80 semi-structured interviews (60 with farmers, 20 with organizational representatives) in two Manitoba case study areas, conducted between August 2004 and March 2005. Interviews focused on weather-related shocks and stresses and the subsequent farmer responses in the period, 1999-2005. The findings suggest that farmers were experiencing heightened weather variability, and therefore increased vulnerability--as demonstrated by exposure to excess moisture in areas typified by moisture deficiencies ('Palliser's Triangle' area). Farmers responded to weather stresses in a variety of ways, including long and short term strategies. This response diversity increased the options available when farmers were exposed to unforeseeable future change. For example, reduced tillage, together with shelterbelts, provided complimentary methods for soil and water conservation. However, long term adaptation was limited by economic pressures and rural decline in both population and services. Low commodity prices and an aging workforce reduced incentives to modify land use practices in ways which foster and protect ecological services. Furthermore, many response strategies where adopted for short-term economics, rather than long-term resilience and systems-orientated thinking. The research reveals that farmers think that the public under-appreciates the farmers' role in food production and environmental stewardship. Issues of wide-scale attitudinal change and shared environmental responsibility are core issues to building agroecosystem resilience to climate change. This project assessed farmer responses using resilience indicators. These included enhancing flexibility through the creation of options; incorporating local resource management knowledge into farm practices; and incorporating and protecting ecological services into farm practices. There was evidence of these responses in the study. However, overall farmer responses added up to less than the potential. While farmers diversified in ways that built resilience to weather shocks and stresses, systemic issues, including economic and policy disincentives, inhibited more effective resilience-building.

AB  - Large stands of Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl., called canebrakes, were vital to wildlife and lowland ecosystem functions and historically covered millions of acres in the southeastern United States. Since European settlement, human disturbance (i.e, clearing for agriculture and fire suppression) has caused giant canebrakes to become critically endangered ecosystems. Increasing evidence suggests the loss of canebrakes has directly impacted riparian ecosystems, resulting in increased soil erosion, poorer water quality, and reduced flood control. Cane's ecological importance has led to an increased interest in canebrake restoration in riparian zones. To examine the role that cane plays in nutrient cycling and to attempt to determine targeted restoration sites, a four phase research strategy was designed to determine physical and chemical properties of existing riparian stands of native giant cane and their associated soils. Phase one was a GIS analysis to determine what geographical features may be used in selecting sites within a landscape suitable for canebrake restoration. First, common physical site characteristics for 140 existing southern Illinois canebrakes were determined. Soil taxonomy and pH were used to represent soil characteristics and percent slope was used as a topographic metric. These factors, combined with digital elevation models and land cover in GIS were used to identify the potential suitability of sites within the watershed for canebrake plantings and general riparian restoration. The remaining three phases examined the role that cane plays in nutrient cycling. Phase two determined the pools and cycling of nitrogen and carbon in canebrakes and compared those to nearby agricultural and forested riparian areas. Phase three quantified the N 2 O and CO2 fluxes from canebrakes and adjacent forested areas. Phase four included methods to quantify nutrient content of leaf litter and live leaves from existing canebrakes to estimate the nutrient use efficiency of cane. Further, a decomposition study was conducted to calculate the decomposition rate of cane leaves and to explore the litter quality attributes of giant cane. The primary purpose of phase two was to compare the effects of perennial riparian vegetation (giant cane and forest) and annual crops on soil quality, nitrogen cycling, and physical properties. This was to determine if any of them have a significant influence on giant cane distribution, while focusing on nitrogen dynamics to help determine why giant cane is a successful riparian buffer species. Five study sites in the Cache River watershed that had cane, agricultural fields (corn-soybean rotation), and forested areas adjacent to one another were selected. Data were collected on soil texture, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk density, nitrogen content (as ammonia and nitrate), and net nitrogen mineralization rates. For Phase three, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions were measured monthly for one year in riparian canebrakes and forests in southern Illinois to determine the rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in bottomland riparian areas. Carbon dioxide emissions had a strong correlation with soil temperature (p < 0.001, r 2 = 0.54), but not with soil water content (p > 0.05), and were greater during the warmer months. Nitrous oxide emissions had a correlation with soil water content (p=0.470, r2 = 0.11), but no relation with soil temperature (p > 0.05), nor a difference across time. Vegetation type did not appear to influence GHG fluxes. Riparian CO 2 and N2 O emission rates were higher than documented cropland emissions, indicating riparian restoration projects to reduce NO3 delivery to streams may affect N2 O and CO2 emissions resulting in an ecosystem tradeoff between water quality and air quality. Leaf deposition, N resorption efficiency and proficiency, and decomposition rates were analyzed in riparian stands of Arundinaria gigantea in southern Illinois for the first time in Phase four. Leaf litter was collected from five established canebrakes monthly over one year and a decomposition study was conducted over 72 weeks. Live leaves, freshly senesced leaves, and decomposed leaves were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content. Leaf litterfall biomass peaked in November at twice the monthly average for all but one site, indicating a resemblance to deciduous leaf fall patterns. Nitrogen and carbon levels decreased 48% and 30%, respectively, between live leaves and 72 weeks decomposed. High soil moisture appeared to slow decomposition rates, perhaps due to the creation of anaerobic conditions. Cane leaves have low resorption proficiency and nutrient use proficiency, suggesting that these riparian canebrakes are not nitrogen limited. These results will help improve our understanding of the role that giant cane plays in a riparian ecosystem and help focus cane restoration efforts in southern Illinois. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - Large stands of Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl., called canebrakes, were vital to wildlife and lowland ecosystem functions and historically covered millions of acres in the southeastern United States. Since European settlement, human disturbance (i.e, clearing for agriculture and fire suppression) has caused giant canebrakes to become critically endangered ecosystems. Increasing evidence suggests the loss of canebrakes has directly impacted riparian ecosystems, resulting in increased soil erosion, poorer water quality, and reduced flood control. Cane's ecological importance has led to an increased interest in canebrake restoration in riparian zones. To examine the role that cane plays in nutrient cycling and to attempt to determine targeted restoration sites, a four phase research strategy was designed to determine physical and chemical properties of existing riparian stands of native giant cane and their associated soils. Phase one was a GIS analysis to determine what geographical features may be used in selecting sites within a landscape suitable for canebrake restoration. First, common physical site characteristics for 140 existing southern Illinois canebrakes were determined. Soil taxonomy and pH were used to represent soil characteristics and percent slope was used as a topographic metric. These factors, combined with digital elevation models and land cover in GIS were used to identify the potential suitability of sites within the watershed for canebrake plantings and general riparian restoration.

AB  - Riparian buffers composed of either native warm season or non-native cool season grasses are commonly planted alongside crop fields. Although their water quality function is well documented, few studies have examined grass buffers as habitat for arthropod communities. The aerial and epigeal arthropods were surveyed using pitfall traps and sticky cards to assess the effects of both grass types on community structure in the buffer and adjacent crop. I predicted that warm season grasses would provide favorable habitat for more diverse and abundant arthropod populations, particularly natural enemies. The weight of evidence did not support my prediction and suggests that cool season grass buffers provide equivalent, if not better habitat for arthropods than warm season grasses. Coupled with higher food quality, cool season species green-up much earlier than warm season grasses in the spring and provide food resources for many herbivores and natural enemies.

AB  - Both public and regulatory communities perceive turfgrass (e.g. lawns) to be a significant contributor to declining water quality. The primary regulatory concerns are sediment and nutrient loss, particularly phosphorus (P). Excess P in surface water results in eutrophication, a biological process by which increased phytoplankton growth may reduce water quality through fish kills and algae blooms, habitat loss and decreased dissolved oxygen levels. Therefore, understanding the extent of sediment and P loss as well as quantifying the effect of P rates during cool season establishment is important. Two greenhouse studies were conducted on a Stark (Aeric Ochraqualfs) clay-loam, calcareous sub-soil with an inherent soil P-level of 12 and 4 mg P kg -1 for the Olsen and Bray P-1 soil test, respectively, to quantify the effects of seven P-rates on seedling establishment and growth for two commonly cool-season lawn species; tall fescue [Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub; formerly known as Festuca arundinacea Schreb.; TF)] and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.; KBG). Additionally, the influence of TF endophyte (E) stem infection (TFE+) on establishment and rooting was assessed. In the first greenhouse study, lasting 11 wks, seven soil P-rates (0, 3, 9, 15, 25, 45 and 75 mg P kg-1 ) were applied to a clay loam sub-soil. Tall fescue was much quicker to establish reaching 50% turf cover 14 d quicker than KBG. Even at a rather low endophyte stem infection rate (24%), TFE+ had superior turf coverage on six of nine rating dates compared to TF without E (TFE-) during the first 8 wks of establishment. The addition of 45-75 mg P kg -1 (98-161 kg P2 O 5 ha-1 ) to the surface soil surface optimized establishment for both species in this study. Leaf tissue P concentrations (LTP) were generally low or critical (1.6-3.8 g kg-1 ) for P rates ranging between 3-25 mg P kg-1 for KBG. Tall fescue produced more total dry matter yield (DMY) than KBG, while TFE+ (2,157 kg ha-1) produced more DMY than TFE- (1,745 kg ha-1 ). In a follow-up greenhouse study, root dry weight for TFE+ was 2.28 g pot-1 compared to TFE- that only had 2.08 g pot-1 . This may partially explain why TFE+ outperformed TFE- throughout our study, perhaps contributing to greater soil nutrient acquisition. Two rainfall simulation events were conducted 14 and 42 days after planting (DAP) with a moderate intensity rainfall, [approximate] 40 mm hr-1 . The two simulated rainfall events quantified the potential sediment, liquid runoff volume and P losses from several common and novel cool-season turfgrass establishment methods. Turfgrass coverage ranged from 0-100% and influenced runoff and sediment losses. Bare soil resulted in sediment losses of 339 and 91 g m -2 at 14 and 42 DAP compared to sod that only lost 14 and 11 g m-2 14 and 42 DAP, respectively. During the first rainfall simulation 14 DAP, all establishment methods resulted in 57 to 81% reductions in total cumulative runoff loss compared to bare soil. The use of sod, sod buffer strips and straw blankets were highly effective in reducing sediment (13-57 g soil m -2 ) and runoff losses (3.6-10.4 mm water) compared to seeded treatments (78 g soil m-2 ) and bare soil (339 g soil m-2 ). The highest cumulative mass soluble P (SP) loss in runoff, however, were from sod, sod buffer strips, straw blankets and seed + low P (32 kg ha-1 ) treatments with concentrations ranging from 42-127 mg P for the rainfall simulation 14 DAP. However, the sod, sod buffer strip and straw blankets had the lowest cumulative total P loss due to low sediment loss from those treatments. These studies demonstrate that to minimize sediment and nutrient loss from newly seeded turfgrass ecosystems a species that establishes rapidly, such as TFE+, should be planted and adequate P-rates will speed seedling development with minimal risk of nutrient and sediment loss. Furthermore, erosion control fabrics or small sod buffer strips may help minimize runoff losses during establishment.

AB  - Riparian buffers are commonly used to mitigate the effect of logging on aquatic ecosystems, but there is little experimental evidence regarding the effectiveness of buffers of different widths. I tested the effect of forestry buffers ranging from 60-198 m in average width on lacustrine zooplankton communities (lake size 2-18 ha). The experiment was Before-After-Control-Impact-designed, with 3 years of pre- (2002-2004) and post-logging (2005-2007) data, for 11 control and 10 treatment lakes. I tested the effect of buffer width on zooplankton densities using repeated-measures MANOVA and variation partitioning. The buffer-by-time interaction significantly affected zooplankton densities, but explained only 1% of the community variation; lake area and water chemistry explained 13%, with the strongest explanatory variables being DOC, Ca 2+ , pH, and Al3+ . This study provides experimental evidence that buffers 60-198 m-wide perform equally well in the mitigation of potential logging effects on zooplankton communities in boreal forest lakes.

AB  - A survey of trees in the farming systems of some areas of the high forest zone of Ashanti Region, Ghana, was conducted in an attempt to contribute to the search for sustainable alternatives to the present farming systems. An inventory using a stratified three-stage sampling technique was adopted; and was complemented with farmer's and village focus group's questionnaires. Albizia zygia is the most frequent and favoured species in the moist semi-deciduous forest (MSF) zone. In the dry semi-deciduous forest (DSF) zone, Ceiba pentandra is the most frequent, dominant and favoured species; while in the moist evergreen forest (MEF) zone, Celtis mildbraedii is the most frequent and dominant tree species. In the three zones, the best fitting models to describe mean stems per hectare by diameter classes for arable and permanent crop farms are the exponential decay and Weibull function respectively. The values of the key characteristic (mean basal area per hectare of live trees on arable crop farms) were 3.71, 7.84 and 11.63 m<SUP>2</SUP>ha<SUP>-1</SUP> with precisions of 26.6&#37, 30.6&#37, and 45.7&#37 for the MSF, DSF and MEF zones respectively. Similar values obtained for mean crown cover percent were 10.0<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif">3.7, 16.7<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif">5.4 and 23.7<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif">13.2. There was no evidence of the margins of farms being generally higher in tree density than other parts of farms, indicating that there is no widespread cultivation of trees to form hedges on farmlands. On fallow regrowth vegetation, Albizia zygia is the most frequent and dominant tree species in the MSF and DSF zones. Ficus exasperata is the most prevalent species in the MEF zone. The Leguminoseae is the most abundant family in all the forest zones. Insight into what currently exists in the farming systems is used to suggest possible management strategies for a variety of goals, particularly the inclusion of native leguminous trees, incluidng Albizia zygia , in most agroforestry packages for the study area and possibly similar areas elsewhere.

AB  - Urban streams are greatly impacted by runoff, construction, and the loss of riparian buffers. Past studies have shown the importance of terrestrial subsidies to aquatic communities in pristine, non-urban systems. During the summer of 2004, I examined how urban stream fish communities are impacted by the degradation of streamside vegetation, which typically would provide allochthonous input into their diets. North and South Buffalo Creeks in Greensboro, NC, and Little Sugar Creek in Charlotte, NC, were used in this study. Natural abundance of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen for periphyton, CPOM, benthic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, seston, FBOM, and fish were examined in restored, unrestored, and forested sites on each stream. Fish and macroinvertebrate communities and fish gut contents were also assessed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - This study examines some effects of clearcutting and road-building on streams in the vicinity of Fundy National Park, New Brunswick. Sixteen streams were selected for sampling: four were reference streams located within mature forest in the park, and twelve streams drained nearby clearcuts 4-20-years old. Streams were selected on the basis of similarities in stream order, size, and accessibility. Along each stream, sampling was centred around a 25-m reach, with at least one riffle, and with depth and width similar across streams. From May to November, 1993, each stream was sampled for temperature, dissolved oxygen, major ions, sedimentation and bedload movement, substrate type and concentration of organic carbon, channel dimensions, riparian vegetation, and invertebrates. Harvesting within the riparian zone reduced canopy shading, reduced cover of aquatic bryophytes, removed large trees and snags, and increased densities of shrubs (primarily Alnus rugosa). Riparian buffer strips reduced these effects, provided they were wide enough to ensure shading of the stream channel and feeder springs, withstand windthrow of riparian trees, and supply inputs of large woody debris. With or without a riparian buffer, streams draining harvested areas had warmer water and greater temperature fluctuations, and larger nutrient concentrations and sedimentation rates than streams draining reference watersheds. Most of the highest rates of sedimentation occurred downstream of logging roads, while most of the lowest rates were recorded in reference streams. Clearcutting appeared to have a negative influence on the abundance of Chironomidae and Nymphomyiidae, and positive influences on Plecoptera, Elmidae, and Oligochaetes. The overall abundance of invertebrates colonizing rockballs was strongly correlated with age of stand, with the greatest numbers occurring in reference and older cutover streams, and the smallest numbers in the most recently cutover streams.

AB  - This investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that geomorphology, flow pathways, and geologic media have important effects on nitrate fluxes and denitrification reactions in an agricultural watershed. The study examines variations in nitrate concentrations of surface and subsurface waters over a range of conditions in a Maryland Coastal Plain watershed. A stream flows through a riparian forest surrounded by cropped fields. An important geomorphological difference is that the stream is incised in the upper basin and non-incised in lower-basin areas; macropores that discharge to the stream are predominantly found in incised channel reaches. Upper-basin ground waters beneath a corn field and a riparian forest were stratified both chemically and with respect to ground-water age. Estimated recharge rates for upper-basin ground waters ranged between 4 and 8 cm/yr. Denitrification in the watershed occurred within a transition zone from relatively oxidized to relatively reduced aquifer sediments. The evidence indicates that sediment sulfides were the primary electron donor sources for denitrification in waters beneath both the corn field and the riparian forest. In incised channel reaches, low-baseflow discharge consisted of relatively old ground waters that were denitrified before discharging to the stream. During high baseflow, discharge consisted of a small vertical component from beneath the stream (old, reduced flow-path waters with no nitrate) mixed with waters with nitrate that had taken faster routes through relatively oxidized sediments. At high baseflow, the nitrate loads to the stream were delivered mainly by macropore discharge and shallow ground-water flow from an oxic ground-water layer near the water table. Discharge from less than 30 separate macropore termination points in upper-basin channel areas supplied large fractions of nitrate loads during high-baseflow conditions. During large storm events, surface and shallow-subsurface flow in the corn field was transmitted to the macropore network beneath the riparian forest and was routed to the stream. Thus, nitrate loads in the incised stream reaches of the watershed were delivered almost entirely under high baseflow to stormflow conditions as dissolved nitrate was routed to stream discharge points through macropore networks and shallow ground water in riparian soils. Nitrate delivery rates to non-incised, lower-basin stream reaches generally were smaller than in the upper basin, in part because nitrate-rich waters were reduced under a wider range of flow conditions in the lower basin. The non-incised areas of the watershed delivered much more water to the stream than the upper-basin incised reaches during high baseflow and storm conditions. These results indicate that nitrate loads and concentrations were weighted towards upper-basin incised-reach areas and towards high-flow conditions. Geomorphology and sediment chemistry are important determinants for nitrate fate in the watershed. Further understanding of nitrate fate could benefit from investigations of other agricultural Coastal Plain watersheds that share similar characteristics to those of this study.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) in 2003 to quantify water quality and wildlife benefits of conservation programs funded by the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (Farm Bill). This study examined past effects of various agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) and investigated potential strategies to target future BMPs within this 72 km 2 watershed in northcentral Missouri as part of the CEAP. Objectives of this study were to (1) quantify effects of BMPs on dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N loads in the GCEW, (2) predict future monitoring required to detect statistically significant changes in dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N load, (3) determine number and extent of BMP establishment required in the GCEW to reach detectable reductions in dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N based on BMPs known to be effective in this setting, (4) develop new methods to quantify and report soil redoximorphic features (SRFs), and (5) investigate advantages/disadvantages associated with development of targeted BMP strategies based on hydrologic simulations, terrain analyses, and quantification of SRFs. Evaluation of storm events between 1993 and 2006 showed no significant effect of BMPs on dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N after 14% of the GCEW had been affected by BMP establishment. Approximately 20 and 4 years of post-BMP implementation monitoring was predicted before a statistically significant (α=0.05) 25% reduction in mean dissolved atrazine and nitrate-N can be demonstrated at the GCEW outlet, respectively. Twenty two percent and 34% of cropped fields in the GCEW required establishment of vegetative filter strips to reduce dissolved atrazine and NO 3 -N loads by 25% at the GCEW based on predictions from a hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Assuming full adoption of this targeted BMP program and available funding, a minimum of 10 years would be required for on-the-ground implementation of this plan based on consultation with local conservationists in the GCEW. However, conservationists indicated this BMP, while effective for improving water quality in this setting, is not likely to be widely adopted by landowners/farm operators due to loss of farmable acreage and complex, cost-share program requirements. The use of a digital camera, image classification software, and exposed soil cores allowed a highly accurate (99%), standardized identification of soil redoximorphic features (SRFs), a soil property widely used to determine soil saturation, hydrologic flow paths, and wetland occurrence. Further digital image processing allowed the determination of representative elementary areas for Low Chroma (17.7 cm 2 ) and High Chroma (25.4 cm2 ) SRFs, allowing for repeatable documentation of SRFs while incorporating inherent soil property variability into measurements. A targeted plan to implement BMPs in the GCEW will differ based on the use of a widely used hydrologic model (SWAT) and terrain analyses (topographic wetness index), identifying fields adjacent to stream as the highest risk for pollutant loss or fields along GCEW borders as high runoff producing areas, respectively. This disagreement indicated terrain analyses such as the topographic wetness index may not accurately predict sensitive landscape positions when soil properties are assumed to be spatially uniform and local hydraulic gradients are based on soil surfaces. Correlation between SRFs and the topographic wetness index was found for one of two GCEW fields, indicating field soil surveys may serve as relatively quick reconnaissance methods to identify sensitive field areas and concentrated flow paths but additional research may be needed to verify these findings at their field locations. This research highlighted the need for continual on-the-ground monitoring and evaluation programs that validate hydrologic predictions and targeting strategies so future agricultur l conservation may benefit from past and future lessons learned.

AB  - Nationwide, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus ) population declines have occurred since 1960. In Maryland, bird count surveys from 1966 to 2000 revealed an annual bobwhite population decline of 4.4% per year. These estimates were consistent with Maryland's estimated annual harvest, which has declined 95% from 1975 to 1997. One possible explanation for the northern bobwhite population decline is habitat alteration related to agricultural practices. To improve habitat for quail, land managers develop and maintain agricultural buffer strips (strips of vegetation, predominantly warm-season grasses, located between agricultural fields and woodlands). However, the use of buffer strips by northern bobwhites is unknown. Therefore, I conducted a radio-telemetry study on pen-raised northern bobwhites at Tudor Farms in Dorchester County, Maryland. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of agricultural buffer strips on pen-raised northern bobwhite habitat use, home range, and survival. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

This thesis examines the effect field margins have on aphid predators at the single field scale, the landscape scale and, using results from a marking study, examines the direct use of a pollen and nectar rich field margin by &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Episyrphus balteatus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At the single field scale, field margins had a positive effect of the numbers of Cantharidae, Empididae, Linyphiidae and &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Tachyporus&lt;/i&gt; spp. in fields with sown margins compared to those without during wheat growth and total aphid predator numbers were significantly higher in fields with margin surrounds in early May but not later in the year. At the landscape scale, results from twelve winter wheat fields with varying densities of surrounding field margins showed predatory &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Tachyporus&lt;/i&gt; spp. to exhibit a positive correlation at scales above 500m radius and Cantharidae to exhibit a negative correlation at local scales. Implications for field margins exerting both positive and negative influences on the presence of aerially dispersing aphid predators in winter wheat fields are discussed. A marking study using rubidium chloride proved direct utilisation of a pollen and nectar rich field margin by the Syrphid &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style:normal&quot;&gt;Episyrphus balteatus&lt;/i&gt;, and the traps used in this study also highlighted the association in distributions between Empididae and cereal aphids. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto&quot;&gt;Overall it was concluded that the presence of field margins does have an effect on the spatial and temporal distributions of some aerially dispersing ap id predators, but the response of each predator group varies depending on numerous interlinking components of their life history and directions for future research are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - Hydrograph separation techniques were used to determine contributions of old and new water during storm events at four sites within the urban Anacostia River watershed. Multiple storm hydrographs were successfully separated with electrical conductivity as a tracer. Total runoff correlated to rainfall, but most runoff ratios were significantly less than the percentage of impervious surfaces. Old water was a significant component of runoff at each site. Peak contributions of old water occurred earlier new water peaks, which suggests rapid transmission of groundwater to streams. New water runoff was the dominant contribution for storm events greater than 2-3 cm. Watershed topography influenced patterns of urbanization and runoff pathways. Riparian buffers along Piedmont streams appeared to be sites of infiltration of overland flow. These results indicate that electrical conductivity is an effective tracer for the evaluation of streamflow sources within large urban watersheds.

AB  - <![CDATA[Recently, much effort has been expended for improving conventional distance sampling methods, e.g. by replacing the design-based approach with a model-based approach where observed counts are related to environmental covariates (Hedley and Buckland, 2004) or by incorporating covariates in the detection function model (Marques and Buckland, 2003). While these models have generally been limited to include fixed effects, we propose four different methods for analysing distance sampling data using mixed effects models. These include an extension of the two-stage approach (Buckland et al., 2009), where we include site random effects in the second-stage count model to account for correlated counts at the same sites. We also present two integrated approaches which include site random effects in the count model. These approaches combine the analysis stages for the detection and count models and allow simultaneous estimation of all parameters. Furthermore, we develop a detection function model that incorporates random effects. We also propose a novel Bayesian approach to analysing distance sampling data which uses a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for updating model parameters and a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm for assessing model uncertainty. Lastly, we propose using hierarchical centering as a novel technique for improving model mixing and hence facilitating an RJMCMC algorithm for mixed models. We analyse two case studies, both large-scale point transect surveys, where the interest lies in establishing the effects of conservation buffers on agricultural fields. For each case study, we compare the results from one integrated approach to those from the extended two-stage approach. We find that these may differ in parameter estimates for covariates that were both in the detection and the count model and in model probabilities when model uncertainty was included in inference. The performance of the random effects based detection function is assessed via simulation and when heterogeneity in the data is present, one of the new estimators yields improved results compared to conventional distance sampling estimators.]]>

AB  - I evaluated the effect of the maize-leucaena agroforestry system on the insect fauna relevant to maize production, to establish if this system has pest management benefits. I also monitored the population dynamics and damage impacts of the leucaena psyllid Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, a new arrival to Africa, and carried out faunistic studies on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders. These studies covered six cropping seasons from September 1992 to August 1995, and were conducted at Mtwapa and Amoyo in coastal and western Kenya respectively. Treatments included monocropped and intercropped (maize, leucaena) plots, weeded and unweeded plots, mulched and unmulched plots and three spacing regimes for leucaena hedgerows. I evaluated the resource concentration hypothesis which suggests that herbivores will be less abundant in diverse habitats because non-host species disrupt the ability of the pest to attack its proper host efficiently. Alley cropping leucaena with maize significantly reduced infestation by stem boring lepidopteran pests and their damage to the maize crop, thus supporting the resource concentration hypothesis. Furthermore, the reduced pest numbers translated into increased yields. On the other hand, abundance and activity of the leucaena psyllid and of herbivorous and detrivorous ground-dwelling beetles was unaffected by the cropping system, and did not support the hypothesis. I also examined possible implications of the enemies hypothesis which posits that vegetational diversity increases both population size and impacts of entomophagous natural enemies that regulate populations of herbivorous anthropod pests. The maize-leucaena cropping system did not increase, and in fact even reduced the abundance and/or activity of some natural enemies of maize stem borers more than in the maize monocrop. The number of ladybirds and ground-dwelling beetles did not differ significantly between treatments. Thus, the enemies hypothesis that natural enemies will be more abundant in polyculture than in monocultures was not corroborated. Studies on the population dynamics of the psyllid revealed that populations were influenced by weather, particularly rainfall, and availability of suitable shoots. New growth of young shoots following rainfall, encouraged psyllid abundance as long as weather conditions were not extreme. Furthermore, damage to leucaena appeared to represent the cumulative and interactive effect of both the feeding activity of psyllids and prevailing environmental/climatic conditions, and did not closely track the actual population of and/or damage by psyllids at a given time. Psyllid populations were generally much higher at Mtwapa than at Amoyo, suggesting possible environmental constraints on population growth. The faunistic studies on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders showed a general increase in abundance within plots during the period of these experiments. The two monocrops had consistently low incidence of both beetles and spiders, while the unweeded plot had highest incidence of spiders, though differences were statistically insignificant. Notwithstanding, my results weakly suggest that vegetational diversity is correlated with abundance of insect population. Implications of this for biological conservation of anthropods are discussed.

AB  - Agroforestry, is an approach to land use which offers much promise in addressing many of the interrelated problems associated with rural development and land degradation. (Scherr, 1992, Nair, 1993). This research incorporates remotely sensed agroforestry landscape information within a computerized model that relates spatial structure at the field and landscape scale to maize production. Remote sensing, cartographic modeling as well as landscape ecological theory and methods of analysis figure prominently in the work. The study area is in the coffee zone on the southern footslopes of Mount Kenya. The research tests the hypotheses that: There is a correlation between landscape and field structure and crop production. Specifically, it is hypothesized that spatial configuration at the field scale, (e.g. patch size, shape and adjacency relationships etc.) as well as at the landscape scale, (density of trees and hedgerows) can be significantly correlated with productivity. The central hypothesis is that spatial variability across the landscape, at scales both at and beyond that of the field, can explain a significant amount of the variability in yields. In order to carry out the work, a recent innovation in remote sensing, the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), has been used in the project. The CASI was used to acquire a detailed digital image of the site at a high spatial resolution (1.75 meter pixel size). Six spectrally narrow width bands were acquired with the purpose of determining chlorophyll density as well as crop type and vigor. Findings indicate that the spatial measures that were undertaken at the landscape scale do not explain enough crop variability to be statistically significant. Rather, it is far better explained at the individual field level. Here it was demonstrated that distance from shelter plantings is inversely and curvilinearly related to crop vigor as measured by the relationship between the Near Infra Red and Red wavelengths. Findings indicate that the positive effects of trees in the study landscape are limited to within 25 meters of the canopy. An optimum hedgerow interdistance of 40 meters is suggested in order to maximize crop vigor. The impact of both the existing conditions as well as two possible alternatives are evaluated for their total landscape wide impacts on maize yields and wood production. It was determined that removal of existing hedgerows (50% percent of all the trees in the area) by a disturbance such as a pest outbreak would cause a 5% reduction in maize production. A second alternative, which identified underutilized planting niches throughout the landscape, is predicted to result in a modest increase in maize production and a doubling a wood products.

AB  - This thesis demonstrates how systems ideas and grounded theory have been applied to provide a broader approach to researching hedgerows in England, drawing on the idea that holistic thinking brings together different peoples relationships with hedgerows and with each other concerning hedgerows.The cultural dimensions of hedgerows and their implications for future hedged landscapes were investigated through the collection and exploration of different groups perspectives -, public, farmers and experts - in England and Canada, using a diversity of primary and secondary data sources.English hedgerows were important to all groups. Everyone like hedged landscapes for aesthetic, visual and wildlife reasons. They were important for the way they break up the landscape; provide signs of the changing seasons; their sense of mystery and intimacy; their connections with the past and childhood memories.

Such cultural identity was absent in the Canadian data.However, some groups also held a rational or objective view which was dominant over this subjective or emotional view and which affects where they draw the boundaries to their systems of interest.

AB  - A forest riparian buffer is an area whose vegetation is trees which is located between a stream and the adjacent uplands. This study tested the efficacy of restored forest riparian buffers along streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed by examining stream macrobenthic community structure. By conducting such a comparative analysis of streams with similar hydrologic and geological settings, but with differing ages of restored or natural forested buffer zones, I assessed the relative functionality of the restored forested wetland for re-establishing a stable, healthy aquatic ecosystem. My research examined macrobenthic community structure in 30 streams with buffers ranging from 0 to greater than 50 years of age. Two separate benthic samples were analyzed from each stream (midreach, and downstream end of the forested buffer zone). Samples were identified to family, enumerated and entered into spreadsheets for statistical analysis. Metrics utilized included taxonomic richness, percent Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera, % dominance, number of tolerant families present, % intolerant individuals, the Family Biotic Index, and several functional feeding group composition measures. Midreach water samples from each site were analyzed in the laboratory for ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, phosphate, total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids. Results showed that habitat, water quality, and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics increase with age of restored buffer. Habitat scores appeared to stabilize between 10 and 15 years of age, were driven mostly by instream substrate availability and width and age of riparian buffer zones. Water quality parameters varied within buffer age groups depending on algal cover and age of surrounding forest vegetation. Benthic invertebrate taxa richness, % EPT, % Plecoptera, % Ephemeroptera, and the FBI all improved with age of buffer zone. Other metrics varied within age classes. Instream habitat quality, was the greatest driver of benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity and health, and appeared to peak within 10-15 years of restoration with noticeable improvements occurring within 5-10 years post restoration.

AB  - Chemical pest control is currently the dominant form of pest management against insect pests in agroecosystems, but has negative side effects. Biological control by specialist predators has been successful in greenhouses, but has not been successfully applied in agroecosystems. Generalist predators have features constraining them as control agents, but have one advantage: they can survive when pests are absent by feeding an alternative prey. In this thesis I have studied the influence of landscape structures and farm management on generalist predators and their predation on an aphid pest on cereals, Rhopalosiphum padi . In accordance with theoretical predictions, predation on establishing aphids in spring was more important for the total aphid attack than predation during the aphid population growth phase. Predation on establishing aphids was higher on organic than conventional farms and highest in landscapes with abundant field margins and perennial crops. Predation during the population growth phase was, surprisingly, highest in simple landscapes, with no differences between organic and conventional farms. The presence of alternative prey can result in decreasing predation of generalist predators on pests, and I show that this effect is scale-dependent. On a field scale, generalist predators were aggregated at high prey densities, and predator abundance was more important for predation on aphids than alternative prey abundance. Thus, the effect of alternative prey was larger on the generalist predator abundance than on the predators' diet. However, higher alternative prey abundance in complex landscapes may still have resulted in the observed lower predation rates on aphids in these landscapes during aphid population growth. Condition of generalist predators, which often is food-limited, was better on organic farms and in landscapes with abundant field margins in a non-aphid year. Possibly because of an aphid outbreak, condition changed asynchronously between farms over three study years. The temporal and spatial environmental variation affected the condition of different species differently, which can be explained by the species' diet and habitat selectivity. This thesis provides further evidence for earlier suggestions that more field margins and perennial crops in relation to annual crops increase alternative prey abundance and overwintering sites for the generalist predators and thereby their abundance, which can enhance biological control of cereal aphids.

AB  - The present research aims to establish the depth of abiotic and invertebrate edge-effects occurring in plantations of two conifer species, and the resulting effects of management practices on 'edge' and 'core' invertebrate communities. Near complete invertebrate samples were collected using chemical knock down allowing analysis of invertebrates at the order, family, genus, species and guild level.Similar invertebrate densities per m2 ground area occurred in both tree species, although communities differed between them, Pinus sylvestris supporting a more diverse community than Picea sitchensis. Species richness, diversity and densities varied with distance from plantation edge with the Acarina, Araneae, Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera and Hemiptera showing particularly strong responses to edge proximity.Abiotic edge-effects, although variable between transects, occurred to an average depth of 30 metres with an approximate 1°C drop in temperature and a 5% increase in relative humidity towards the core. Invertebrate edge-effect depths varied with species, ranging from 5 to 80 metres. In P. sitchensis invertebrate richness and densities, particularly for Coleoptera, Araneae and Hemiptera were higher in the edge habitat, whilst increased richness and diversity occurred in the core of P. sylvestris.Edge habitat is key to optimising richness in P. sitchensis, however application of core-area models shows that current plantation management fails to maximise edge habitat. Reduction of patch size and/or increasing edge features will increase species richness. In contrast core habitat is vital to species richness in P. sylvestris. Current small patch size limits invertebrate richness, increased patch size and implementation of edge buffer zones would protect core habitat thus enhancing invertebrate species richness.

AB  - The low population density of northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) on farmed landscapes may be explained by use of insecticides or by reduced habitat in modern farming systems. On part of two 2 farms ($>$350 ha), habitat was improved by incorporating 2.5 m field borders composed of natural vegetation. Sixty-two percent of locations of radio-tagged quail (n = 69) were in soybean fields during August. Quail using farms with field borders were 1.5-3.2 times more likely to be exposed to insecticides than quail using farms without field borders (P = 0.04). In 1993, 67% of broods $<$14 days of age (n = 6) were sprayed with insecticides during August. Survival of chicks exposed to insecticides was high (80-100%). In mesocosm experiments, captive quail broods were placed in large field pens, directly sprayed with insecticides and held in pens for 2 to 70 hours. Methomyl and thiodicarb, commonly-used insecticides, did not cause mortality or brain cholinesterase depression (P $>$ 0.05). Methyl parathion, which receives little use on row crops in eastern North Carolina, caused significant cholinesterase depression (P $<$ 0.05). Feeding rates of human-imprinted quail chicks were measured in a variety of farm habitats to evaluate the indirect effects of farming systems on quail brood ecology. Growth rate trials indicated that 7-10 day-old chicks required $\sim$6 g of arthropods/day. Chicks foraging in conventionally-tilled crop fields (n = 31) would need 18-25 hours to meet daily food requirements. While chicks fed at higher rates along edges of conventionally-tilled crop fields (n = 11) ($P < 0.05$), hours of foraging needed to meet daily food requirements remained high (9-15 hours). Daily arthropod requirements of chicks could be met in fallow and no-till soybean fields in 4.3 hours of foraging (Range 3-9). An analysis of 15 farms indicated that $<$2.5% of the farmed landscape was suitable brood habitat prior to August. In August, maturing no-till soybeans increased suitable brood habitat to 22.5%. Modern farming systems appeared to reduce quail recruitment indirectly by reducing food sources for young chicks, primarily through control of weeds in crop fields and maintenance of vegetation in non-crop areas in a condition unsuitable to quail.

AB  - Riparian buffers in agricultural landscapes are designed to trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Also, over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow from moving into the buffers; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough which concentrates runoff. Breakthrough by concentrated flow can lead to gully formation that may reduce the filtering capacities of buffer systems by providing direct conduits to stream channels. This study explores the frequency of concentrated flow paths in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at 10 field sites in southern Illinois to characterize concentrated flow paths, accumulated berm sediments, and field area drained by concentrated flow. Detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were created for each site and riparian buffer and agriculture field characteristics were analyzed to assess the development and occurrence of concentrated flow paths. At each site, soil samples were analyzed to characterize sediment deposition patterns within the buffer. To assess the prevalence of concentrated flow paths at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys. Five stream segments, approximately 1000 m long, were randomly selected within each watershed and surveyed for the occurrence and size of concentrated flow paths. These data were analyzed with respect to riparian buffer vegetation, buffer width, and surrounding land cover data. Concentrated flow paths were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys indicating a common occurrence in agricultural watersheds of southern Illinois. Among field scale sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82.5-100% of the drainage areas contributing to riparian buffers. Results from the watershed scale analysis suggest that concentrated flow paths are significantly more abundant in agricultural land cover, than forested land. Current riparian buffer design principles are based on the assumption that sheet flow is the primary form of surface runoff entering buffers. Furthermore, buffers are installed and not maintained which can lead to berm accumulation and buffer failure. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was the prevalent form of runoff at field scale sites. Managers need to consider the occurrence of concentrated flow paths when designing riparian buffers to protect stream water quality.

AB  - This dissertation examines the impacts of distance-dependent spatial externalities on patterns of economic activity in a free market setting. This class of externalities, which include such examples as smog dispersal, pesticide drift, and habitat degradation from roads, are referred to as "edge-effect externalities". Under edge-effect externalities, economic optimality will require not only the correct allocation of land to different uses, but also the correct arrangement of land uses. However, an unregulated free market will potentially fail to achieve an efficient arrangement of land uses. Chapter 2 develops a spatially continuous one-dimensional model of edge-effect externalities. The model demonstrates that, while the externality creates an incentive for a recipient to distance himself from the generator, this distance is too small from a social standpoint. The model also demonstrates the potential for positive externalities between those impacted by the edge-effect externality. Chapter 3 formally demonstrates the potential for edge-effect externalities to create non-convexities in the production possibilities frontier. Further, it demonstrates that conflicting border per unit area is a summary measure of landscape efficiency under edge-effect externalities, but this ratio will vary with the number, shape, and geographic concentration of parcels in the externality-receiving use. Chapter 4 develops a two dimensional agent-based cellular automaton model of free-market land use in an economy impacted by edge-effect externalities. It demonstrates that in an unregulated free-market without bargaining, both Pareto-efficient and inefficient equilibrium landscape patterns are possible. Initial configurations of finns, permanent geographic features, and transportation costs will impact final outcomes. Chapter 6 tests the hypothesis that production patterns for California Certified Organic Farms reflect possible avoidance of negative spatial spillovers from surrounding conventional farms. Differences in parcel size, shape, and surroundings between C.C.O.F and non-C.C.O.F parcels are demonstrated. While inherently more vulnerable to losses from mandatory buffer zones, C.C.O.F parcels are shown to potentially lose a much lower proportion of their land to buffers than non-C.C.O.F parcels. However, very few C.C.O.F farms border C.C.O.F farms under separate management, indicating that growers have not managed to coordinate to capture potential positive externalities.

AB  - The field of ecological economics continues to grapple with addressing issues surrounding the value of ecosystem services. What is clear is that there is not one correct set of values, concepts or methodologies which can address issues of ecosystem valuation. There is a need for improved understanding of the value of ecosystem services, for value pluralism and for inclusion of local communities in valuing ecosystem services. In developing countries, where ecosystem services play a critical role in social and economic well-being, it is essential to understand how ecosystem services contribute to various aspects of well-being, including physical, economic, cultural and spiritual. In this regard, there is a need to develop indicators of human well-being as an alternative to the often-used Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income measurements. As these countries continue to develop, there is and will continue to be a need for empirical work which can contribute to decisions regarding trade-offs between development and conservation. This dissertation, composed of a theoretical overview and synthesis of valuation and of three separate case studies, attends to these issues in several ways: (1) by advancing understanding of how different development pathways can affect economic, environmental and social outcomes; (2) by analyzing the links between ecosystem services and human wellbeing; (3) by analyzing the shortcomings of commonly-applied human well-being indicators; (4) by applying participatory valuation techniques and integrating social and ecological data into a single spatial framework; (5) by applying a recently-developed methodology--spatial value transfer--to estimate the economic value of ecosystem services at a local level. The first case study on two neighboring Thai provinces, examines the drivers of the divergent development patterns, the corresponding effects of these divergent pathways as revealed through well-being indicators, and the critical aspects of wellbeing overlooked by these indicators. Over 30 years ago, two neighboring Thai provinces, Samut Songkhram and Samut Sakhon, were ecologically, socioeconomically and culturally similar. However, the provinces have since diverged, resulting in different economic, environmental and social outcomes. Samut Sakhon was influenced by conventional economic forces, dramatically expanding its manufacturing sector. By contrast, the UNDP cited Samut Songkhram as a "showcase of the sufficiency economy," although the extent to which the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy was deliberately applied is unclear. Today, the Gross Provincial Product is much higher in Samut Sakhon, but Samut Songkhram ranks higher on the Human Achievement Index (HAI). In comparison to conventional economic indicators, the HAI provides a more realistic depiction of the provinces; however, the index has shortcomings in regards to social and environmental issues. Samut Sakhon struggles with numerous environmental and social issues, while Samut Songkhram has become a sustainable tourism destination, capitalizing on its well-preserved natural and cultural heritage. This case study provides empirical evidence regarding the limits of the GDP as a proxy for human wellbeing, the detrimental effects of focusing primarily on economic values, and the positive development benefits of preserving and acknowledging environmental and social values. The second case study uses the concept of a coupled social-ecological system to identify social-ecological "hotspots" through combining perceived community values with ecological data on the Rensselaer Plateau, which is one of the largest ecologically intact habitat areas in New York State. This study responds to the call for value pluralism and for inclusion of local community in valuing ecosystem services. Data on community values was collected through participatory mapping workshops, and later coded into a value typology, and finally digitized using ArcGIS software. Ecological value--priority biodiversity con ervation areas--were designated by a local ecologist and also digitized using ArcGIS software. Through analysis in ArcGIS, community values were combined with the ecological values to identify social-ecological "hotspots." The third case study applies the recently-developed methodology of spatial value transfer to estimate the economic values of ecosystem services on the Rensselaer Plateau. Economic values are estimated for numerous ecosystem services which include biological control, disturbance prevention, gas and climate regulation, habitat refugium, nutrient regulation, other cultural, pollination, recreation and aesthetics, soil retention and formation, waste assimilation, and water regulation and supply across various land cover types which include forest, lakes and reservoirs, cropland, riparian buffer, rivers and streams, and wetlands. It was estimated that the ecosystems on the Rensselaer Plateau provide over $300 million in benefits each year. Spatial variation in economic values was minimal because the land cover on the Plateau is mostly forested.

AB  - Fixed-width riparian buffers are a common best management policy enforced in forested landscapes on first and higher order streams. These buffer areas are delineated along stream banks in the field, based on the presence of flowing water. However the presence of ephemeral streams may affect the connectivity of harvested lands to riparian buffers. We sought to understand the influence of ephemeral streams, determined from terrain analysis, on fixed-width riparian buffers. The objectives were to: (1) use LiDAR data and spatially explicit analysis tools to establish the affect of ephemeral streams on buffer efficacy; (2) determine the effect of the location and size of cut-blocks in relation to the presence of a fixed-width riparian buffer; (3) demonstrate that fixed-width riparian buffers are an ineffective management practice for trapping sediments generated in harvested landscapes. The inclusion of high resolution terrain data in the evaluation of riparian buffers: decreased the estimates of the connectivity to harvested lands, the sensitivity of the distribution of cut-blocks on that connectivity and the overall efficacy of fixed-width buffers along first order streams. The inclusion of un-forested ephemeral streams: (i) reduced the area of harvested lands in which flow-paths were directly connected to a riparian buffer and (ii) identified areas within the fixed-width that were isolated from the majority of flow-paths from harvested lands. Finally, the flow-path analysis led to reduced estimates of riparian flow-path length, and the ratio of buffer area to upslope area. It also became evident that when all forested areas were included in the flow-path analysis, watersheds with a fixed-width riparian buffer or cut-to-shore were indistinguishable. Because previous studies on the effectiveness of riparian buffers were based on 1st and higher order streams, the majority of the harvested lands were likely isolated in terms of surface runoff from the riparian buffer area studied. This thesis presents a case study of four watersheds to illustrate that the inclusion of high-resolution terrain data with a topographic flow-path analysis will provide valuable insight on use of fixed-width riparian buffers to mitigate non-point source pollutants from harvested lands.

AB  - The rose chafer, Macrodactylus subspinosus (F.), is a sporadic pest of fruit throughout Michigan. In 1999 and 2000 research was conducted on the relationship between rose chafer and improved trapping systems in Michigan peach orchards. Traps placed at any height were equally attractive to rose chafer. This is the first study to demonstrate the potential of mass trapping for control of M. subspinosus in peach and the first indication that benefits from mass trapping of this pest could be achieved in a single year of trapping. Overall, the mass trapping trials revealed that M. subspinosus adults quickly move into peach orchards upon emergence from overwintering sites. Substantial damage was recorded in June samples taken approximately two weeks after the first beetles were caught in perimeter traps. Mass trapping as a control strategy will therefore be most effective if traps are in place prior to the predicted first emergence of beetles. Control was best if traps were placed at least 12 m from any orchard border, with optimal catches within the 12 m to 24 m distance. Traps placed on grassy borders recorded more beetle captures than any other habitat recorded. Mean beetle captures were two-fold greater than in perimeter traps in these habitats compared to interior traps. Mean fruit injury in trapped orchards was significantly less than non-trapped orchards. A mark-and-recapture study would suggest beetles moved upwind from their release points. The most beetle were captured in traps adjacent to the release points.

AB  - Heavy wheeled and tracked vehicle training has been conducted on portions of the landscape of Fort Knox, Kentucky for approximately 60 years. Fort Knox is located on the Kentucky Karst Plain and sinkholes are dominant features of this area. Sinkholes and karst terrain present an atypical problem in combination with this unique land use, potentially impacting downstream and local terrestrial environment. A study of the training area sinkhole complex was conducted as a first step toward mitigating the impact of military activities and reduces potential problems of sedimentation and water quality degradation. A total of 20 sinkholes within Training Areas 9 and 10 at the Fort Knox Military Reservation were randomly selected to represent the study area. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between stand structural characteristics, understory light availability and understory vegetation in sinkhole riparian buffers and concentrated flow paths and with the amount of sediment entering sinkholes in the study area. Vegetation data were collected during the growing months of May and June in 2009. All regressions analyses for vegetative structures have r2 values between 0.000 to 0.308 indicating weak to no correlation among the variables. Light availability and percent herbaceous cover showed moderate and weak relationship in buffers (r = 0.547, p = 0.003) and flow paths (r = 0.164, p = 0.245). Sediment gained in splay areas showed no significant relationship to vegetation structure (r = 0.039 to -0.335). The relationship between sediment gained and mean percent herbaceous cover was not significant in flow paths (r = -0.172, p = 0.2341) or buffers (r = 0.130, p = 0.292). While the results of this study suggest the amount of the sediment depositing in the sinkholes was unrelated to observe variation in sinkhole vegetation, the relationship between overstory vegetation and understory vegetation within sinkholes was more noticeable. On site observations strongly suggest that concentrated flow paths were the primary conduits for sedimentation into splay areas. Therefore, management considerations pertaining to training areas should minimize flow paths leading to sinkholes. Best management practices for Fort Knox training areas should integrate these research findings, in addition to current knowledge of riparian buffers and training areas' management requirements.

AB  - Riparian buffers are a commonly utilized best management practice (BMP) for mitigating non-point source pollution from agricultural fields. This practice is most effective when runoff enters the buffer as sheet flow. However runoff from becomes concentrated and forms concentrated flow paths (CFPs) breaking through the buffer in critical erosional areas. These critical areas can be determined prior to the implementation of a BMP such as a riparian buffer through incorporation of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This approach utilizes field characteristics with hydrological processes in order to determine the erosion risk areas from observed field data throughout an entire watershed. In order to re-establish a riparian buffer in critical areas managers need a method that can prevent erosion and the loss of top soil. This study evaluates an innovative method, "Buffer in a Bag", used to restore riparian buffer benefits and to prevent further erosion in CFPs. There were three different treatments initiated for this study the first two treatments the "Buffer in a Bag", and Hand-Planted were implemented prior to the broadcasting of switchgrass seed. The final treatment was the Control, which required no planting within the treatment plot. The "Buffer in a Bag" treatment utilized the placement of giant cane rhizomes within burlap bags along the channel of concentrated flow. The hand planted treatment utilized the placement of giant cane rhizomes planted in the agricultural field adjacent to the path of concentrated flow. The presence of these CFPs breaking through riparian buffers has been noted, but the actual significant soil erosion occurring within the CFP and in the adjacent field has yet to be quantified. Through the use of topographical surveys and geostatistical analysis to produce digital elevation models (DEM) of in-field elevation changes the hydrological processes and volumetric difference for CFPs can be determined. The goal was to define the variability and the spatial pattern from the data as a means of providing comparisons between subsequent survey periods over time and space to estimate the difference and movement of sediment within CFPs. The volumetric differences found when comparing the DEMs between survey periods provide a quantifiable method for evaluating the implementation of a treatment, such as the "Buffer in a Bag". Using geostatistical analysis of volumetric difference between the treatment plots determined that that there was no significant difference between the CFP's over the study period. The mean percentage volumetric difference within the treatment plots between "Buffer in a Bag", Hand-Planted, and Control treatments were -2.49%, -3.72%, and -2.37%, respectively. There was overall net erosion across all treatments with the erosion and accumulation being significantly different across the survey periods for all the treatment CFPs. The mean percentage volume loss across treatments and survey periods varied from positive 10% accumulation to negative 15% erosion for overall loss when looking at each individual survey and CFP. The displayed loss of valuable topsoil and continued expansion of these concentrated flow paths emphasis the need for research in further management applications. There needs to be an effective method developed to address the volumetric difference within CFPs forming in these high risk erosion areas. Using a GIS/RUSLE approach to indicate these high risk erosion areas will hopefully facilitate the prevention of the formation of concentrated flow paths prior to the implementation of a BMP, such as riparian buffers.

AB  - Experiments were conducted in Homestead, Florida, during 1979-1981 to describe tomato plant phenology, tomato pinworm (TPW), Keiferia lycopersicella (Walsingham), dispersion patterns, economic damage to tomato and the effects of parasitoids, edgerows, rainfall and cultural practices on TPW population dynamics. Tomato cv. Flora-Dade phenology was described. Six stages were designated, based on the number of leaves, flowers, fruits and physiological plant characteristics. This description can be used in making pest management decisions. Based on relative variation (RV) and sampling costs, sampling units for TPW egg and larval stages were determined. Eggs were generally (51%) found in the upper plant canopy, and larvae (50%) in the lower. Larger sampling units were allocated to the upper and lower plant canopy for eggs and larvae, respectively. Economic injury level was determined to be 1 larva per plant. Yield can be reduced 10-40% when 1-12 larvae are attacking 45 day-old plants. Results indicated a correlation between number of foliar injuries in the lower plant canopy and fruit damage. Higher TPW infestation occurred during March-May, 1980 and March-April, 1981, compared with other months (Jan., Feb.). Trichogramma pretiosum Riley caused 33-73% TPW egg mortality during May-July, 1981. TPW larval parasitism fluctuated between 39 and 42% during 1980-1981. The most abundant larval parasite was Apanteles spp., followed by Sympiesis stigmatipennis and Temelucha spp. TPW adult dispersion and effects of field edges on TPW dispersion and field colonization were evaluated. Field areas surrounded by edge-rows had higher TPW damage than areas surrounded by pastures. Use of artificial rainfall demonstrated that when plant foliage was irrigated behavioral change in larval feeding resulted in 50% reduction of larval injuries compared to injuries on soil-irrigated plants. TPW adult emergence was reduced 86% when high levels of water were applied to pupae in the soil. The effect of cultural practices on the TPW oversummering population was evaluated. The mean number of injuries per m('2) was 28 times higher in crops planted later (December, 1980) than in crops planted earlier (October-November, 1980). Lower numbers of injuries were found in crops disced and mowed than in abandoned fields.

AB  - Forest resource managers have become increasingly aware of the shortcomings of conventional riparian management. Riparian buffers may enter a decadent state as trees age and begin to acquire attributes that may reduce the effectiveness of the buffer and threaten non-timber resource values associated with the riparian zone. A selective harvest was designed and implemented in an experimental riparian buffer within FML 01, aimed at circumventing the problems associated with traditional riparian resource management. Due to the ecological and recreational value of the riparian resource, harvesting was designed with the intent to integrate various existing non-timber values. A pilot study was subsequently implemented to address the initial effects of selective harvesting on buffer floristics, the avian community, erosion and sedimentation and streamside aesthetics. Primary data was collected for one year prior to, and for one year following, harvesting. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - This study compared effects of human and natural wildfire disturbance on age class distribution and associated ecosystem properties of forests in a 15,670 km2 area of the western Cascades of Oregon. The study site is characterized by three forest use types: low elevation, intensively harvested private industrial lands; mid elevation partially harvested public forest lands; and high elevation wilderness lands. Hypothetical landscapes were constructed, representing wildfire conditions, the current (1995) condition, and forest management strategies. The spatial pattern of forests in each landscape was depicted by the distribution of four forest age classes (0-30, 31-80, 81-200, and 201+ years). Wildfire-affected forests were simulated for 3000-year periods using an existing model with six alternate parameterizations obtained from fire history studies. Forest patterns on the 1995 landscape were obtained from classified remotely sensed imagery. Three landscapes representing hypothetical forest management strategies were constructed: (1) riparian buffers, (2) reserve allocations, and (3) multi-age rotation harvests. Forest age class amounts, spatial distribution, and arrangement were compared between wildfire-affected, 1995, and managed landscapes. Wood production, carbon storage, water yield, and species diversity of each landscape were evaluated using simple measures from empirical studies relating forest structural patterns to ecosystem properties. Comparison of the 1995 landscape with simulated wildfire-affected landscapes indicates that private industrial lands in 1995 had more young forest, whereas wilderness lands had more old forest, than most, or all, simulated wildfire conditions. Because private industrial and wilderness areas deviate from the range of natural (wildfire-affected) variability in opposite directions, the study area as a whole is within the probable range of natural variability over the past few millennia. Forest ages classes on public non-wilderness lands were within the range of simulated wildfire-affected landscapes. Ecosystem properties of the current and managed landscapes were within the range of variability of those properties in the simulated wildfire-affected landscapes. Given the caveats imposed by the simplistic assumptions, some ecosystem properties appear to be sensitive to the arrangement of forest age classes. Future studies would benefit from the use of structurally based, rather than age-based, forest classes, for evaluating forest pattern effects on ecosystem properties.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

AB  - Aquatic scientists have invested much time and effort in examining the various factors affecting unionid mussel distribution and community success. I used correlation and multiple regression analyses to compare two sets of habitat/stream condition variables at different scales with mussel community parameters (density, species richness, and Shannon-Weiner diversity) from five different rivers in southeastern Kansas. These included use of satellite imagery to determine vegetation greenness of various riparian buffers, quantified through NDVI measurements (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). I also examined individual mussel health via two tissue condition indices to determine the overall health and prognosis for these mussel communities, and used stable isotope analysis ([delta] 13 C and [delta]15 N) of four species of unionids (Amblema plicata, Leptodea fragilis, Quadrula quadrula , and Tritogonia verrucosa ) and an invasive bivalve (Corbicula fluminea ) to determine whether the bulk of freshwater bivalve diets comes from benthic particulate organic matter (POM) via pedal-feeding or from suspended POM via filter-feeding. None of the micro- and macrohabitat variables proved to be good predictors of mussel community metrics. The six microhabitat variables were not correlated with density or species diversity, and only partially with richness; dissolved oxygen was correlated with one condition index for all species examined. NDVI showed no better correlation with community parameters or condition indices than did the instream factors, though Spring-NDVI was fairly well associated with the body condition index. Amblema, Leptodea , and Corbicula had nearly identical [delta]13 C values but differed significantly from Quadrula and Tritogonia . [delta] 15 N values were similar for all unionids but were significantly lower than those found for Corbicula . Both [delta]13 C and [delta]15 N values varied consistently among rivers. Increases in [delta]15 N values for unionids over suspended POM were not significantly different from expected enrichment values, while differences between unionids and benthic material were more enriched in 15 N than expected. These data may indicate that NDVI data are not suitable predictors of mussel community structure. However, several design and technology issues should be addressed before abandoning such data as a replacement for costly and time-consuming instream surveys. Additionally, further isotopic research should include refined fractionation by size and type for any bulk food sources.

AB  - The vegetation dynamics of non-tidal freshwater wetlands have been the subject of many studies. Yet there remains a basic theoretical question: Is hydrology or substrate more important in controlling the vegetation dynamics of freshwater wetlands? The primary objective of this research was to investigate the relative importance of substrate (i.e., soil type) and hydrologic regime (i.e., timing of drawdown) in vegetation dynamics. To that end, a descriptive study of the vegetation of twelve restored wetlands of various ages and an experimental study of the growth and germination of two species, Alisma plantago-aquatica and Panicum virgatum , common at the restored sites, were conducted. Both studies indicated that hydrology, as expressed by vegetation zone (i.e., the relative elevation of subplots) is the primary controlling factor in the vegetation dynamics of these restored wetlands, across and within sites. Seasonal variations in water level strongly influenced the overall character of vegetation across restored sites and within vegetation zones of sites by determining individual species distributions. The seed bank at the restored sites appeared to be responding to differences in the timing and extent of drawdown. While the effects of hydrologic regime on vegetation dynamics were not unexpected, the effects due to substrate were the more important result. This research provides direct evidence that within a particular hydrologic regime, substrate characteristics can affect the growth and germination of wetland plants and, at the landscape level, the nature of freshwater wetland plant communities. The amount of time elapsed since restoration was also shown to affect the nature of the vegetation of these restored sites. Observations indicate that wildlife, in all likelihood, have contributed to the plant species diversity of these restored wetlands. Located in topographically low areas of agricultural fields, these wetlands were restored to control agricultural runoff and provide wildlife habitat. These restored wetlands were found to provide important habitat for both flora and fauna and significantly increase the biodiversity of this largely agricultural area.

AB  - The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has been widely tested for its ability to predict soil erosion, runoff, and sediment delivery over a very wide range of conditions and scales for both hillslopes and watersheds. However, WEPP has not been used to estimate nutrient loss, in particular phosphorus losses. It is well known that most of the phosphorus transported from cropland is attached to sediment; consequently management practices that reduce erosion and sediment transport could reduce phosphorus losses. Management practices like vegetative filter strips, grass barriers, and multispecies riparian buffers have been proposed to reduce the transport of sediment and nutrients from agricultural lands to streams. However, research has not specifically addressed the question of how different amounts of perennial vegetative cover distributed in the landscape could affect soil loss and water quality. The first objective of this dissertation is to incorporate and test the ability of WEPP to estimate phosphorus loss with sediment at the watershed scale. The second objective is to study the effect of different landscape configurations on sediment yield and phosphorus loss using the WEPP model. The hypothesis related to the first objective is that WEPP can be coupled with a simple algorithm to simulate transport of phosphorus bound to sediment at the watershed outlet. Two hypotheses are related to the second objective. The first hypothesis is that increasing the amount of perennial cover located at the bottom of the hillslope will reduce sediment yield and phosphorus loss within a corn-soybean rotation at the watershed scale. The second hypothesis is that the strategic placement of perennial cover strips distributed in the hillslopes will reduce sediment yield and phosphorus export from the watershed compared to the same proportion of perennial cover located at the bottom of the hillslope. Two watersheds (side by side) in corn-soybean rotation were used to test the model. Watershed sizes were 5.05 and 6.37 ha. Total phosphorus (TP) loss at the watershed outlet were simulated as the product of TP in the soil (kg of TP kg -1 of soil), amount of sediment at the watershed outlet (kg of soil ha -1 ), and an enrichment ratio (ER) factor. One approach (P-empirical) estimated ER according to an empirical relationship, and the other approach used ER calculated by WEPP (P-WEPP). To address the first hypothesis of the second objective the scenarios were: 2.5% (2.5_B scenario), 5% (5_B scenario), 10% (10_B scenario), 15% (15_B scenario), and 20% (20_B scenario) of the area converted to perennial cover and placed at the bottom of the hillslope. To address the second hypothesis of the second objective the scenarios included 10% of the area in perennial cover placed at the bottom of the hillslope (10_B scenario), 10% in perennial cover with 50% at the bottom of the hillslope and the other 50% placed 40 m upslope (10_S scenario), 10% in perennial cover where WEPP simulated maximum detachment (10_WEPP scenario), and 20% in perennial cover with 50% at the bottom of the hillslope and the other 50% at 40 m upslope (20_S scenario). The same baseline scenario was used to address both hypotheses of the second objective. This scenario corresponded to a corn soybean rotation. The t-test failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was no statistical difference between the mean measured and simulated TP loss. This was the case for both methods ( p =0.49 and p =0.40, P-empirical and P-WEPP, respectively). The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.80 and 0.78 for the P-empirical and P-WEPP method, respectively. The inclusion of perennial cover at the bottom of the hillslope decreased the amount of sediment delivered to the channel; the reductions modeled for the various scenarios when compared to the baseline scenario were in the range of published field work. However, sediment yield and phosphorus losses at the watershed scale were affected by erosion in the channels. Doubling the amount of perennial cover from 10% to 20% p aced at the bottom of the hillslope reduced the amount of sediments and total phosphorus with sediment on average by 34% and 32%, respectively. With 20% perennial cover, sediment yield was reduced on average by 38% and 74% compared to the baseline scenario for the 20_S and 20_B scenarios, respectively. Within WEPP modeling limitations, this work suggested that placement at the bottom may provide the greatest benefit.

AB  - The effect of field margin management on crop yield and weed biomass in the crop edge (headland) was investigated. Treatment did not have any significant effect on cereal yields, and taking a one metre strip out of crop production to establish a sterile, natural regeneration or sown strip, did not significantly reduce yields compared to cropping to the field edge. Conservation headlands generally contained greater amounts of weed biomass than fully sprayed headlands, but grain yields were not significantly reduced. Soil compaction affected yield in one of the field experiments, but not the other, where soil density values were fairly uniform. No relationship was found between fertiliser application and yield.In a survey of cereal headlands, distance from the field boundary was the most important factor affecting yield. Where yield increased with distance from the field boundary, there was a strong linear relationship with log distance (P<0.001). Weed dry matter was related to distance, and there was a significant relationship between weed dry matter and grain yield in the first year of the survey (P<0.001), but not in the second.Communities of herbaceous field margin species were established, and the effects of nitrogen fertiliser and sublethal glyphosate application were examined over two years. Cover abundance of grasses was greater than that of dicotyledonous species throughout. Bromus sterilis was the most abundant species in 1995, but by 1996 it had been replaced by Arrhenatherum elatius. Increasing fertiliser rate had a negative effect on total vegetation cover in 1995, due to individual plants lodging. During 1996, fertiliser application increased the cover abundance of the dominant perennial species A. elatius (P<0.001), and also the annuals B. sterilis and Galium aparine (P<0.05). Sublethal doses of glyphosate significantly reduced total cover abundance (P<0.001), and had a greater effect on grasses compared to dicotyledonous species.Measurement of spray drift into a hedgerow showed that positioning the end of the tractor-mounted spray boom 2m or 6m away from the crop edge reduced drift into the hedge-bottom compared with spraying up to the crop edge (P<0.001).

AB  - Amphibians are often considered indicators of biological health, but populations worldwide have been declining over the past two decades. These declines have raised concerns about land use and the condition of the environment. Direct anthropogenic changes to the landscape such as fragmentation, conversion, and resource extraction have led to extensive habitat losses, which have been cited as the major cause of observed declines. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to habitat alterations as many species depend upon both aquatic and terrestrial habitats for completion of complex life cycles. In order to address the imperative of amphibian declines and to conserve amphibian populations, it is essential that we first define and protect essential habitat. Salamanders are integral to the ecology of the headwater ecosystems they inhabit, where they are the most abundant vertebrates with biomasses exceeding that of small mammals and breeding birds. It has been speculated that the southern Blue Ridge physiographic province is the center of North American salamander diversity, the majority of these salamanders are found in close association with headwater stream habitats, and have biphasic life cycles consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a terrestrial adult stage. The success and prolificity of salamanders in the Appalachians is highly dependent upon riparian forests and the microclimate therein. One the most pervasive threats to riparian habitat is timber harvesting. Current regulations require a minimal riparian buffer to be retained along headwater and low order streams to mitigate the effects of logging. These measures are likely inadequate based upon the known biology of salamanders and the environmental changes that ensue riparian forest removal. Salamanders in the Appalachian region have been extensively studied, but the majority of research assessing the impacts of logging has focused on terrestrial species that are not dependent on stream habitats for egg deposition or larval development. I have collected data on both larval and adult salamanders in headwater streams in western North Carolina to determine the impacts of even-aged timber harvest on salamander populations and to assess the efficacy of riparian buffers in ameliorating these effects. My data show that larval two-lined salamanders are negatively impacted by increased stream sedimentation following riparian logging and that increasing the riparian buffer around the stream reduces sedimentation effects while larval black-bellied salamanders were not significantly affected by riparian treatments. Adult and juvenile salamanders dependent on terrestrial habitat were also affected; seal salamander densities were significantly higher in streams with little to no riparian buffer while Ocoee salamanders were significantly less abundant. I also showed that it is unlikely that salamanders will persist or thrive for more than a season or two in logged forests due to a significant deterioration in body condition of Ocoee salamanders in logged riparian areas. My results indicate that current riparian forest conservation measures are inadequate to preserve either larval or adult salamander populations.

AB  - <![CDATA[Hare and rabbit populations were surveyed in several large, pasture-dominated, sites in north-east England between 2007 and 2009. Estimated density of brown hares in the studied region was far higher than the published national average density for this species in pastures but with very large variation between superficially similar sites. We explored a new method to survey hares using night-time line transect distance sampling and compared this method with day time surveys. Night-time distance sampling produced improved precision estimates of hares with considerably less survey effort by maximising detectability during surveys. Hares and rabbits had different habitat requirements in grassland areas and areas dominated by intensive sheep grazing produced the lowest hare densities and in most cases were associated with high rabbit densities. Field size was an important determinant of the distribution of both hares and rabbits but with contrasting effects for the two species. Predator control appeared more important in increasing rabbit numbers than hares in the studied region. Our results indicate that recent changes in pasture management in the UK might favour high rabbit densities with potentially significant economic impacts for the agricultural sector. Radio-tracking indicated that habitat heterogeneity was important for hares at both between and within field levels. Hares preferentially used field margins during both active and inactive periods and selected woodland edges and unimproved grassland during diurnal periods, suggesting that they might benefit from measures designed to increase heterogeneity and re-establishment of non-farmed habitat features, particularly field margins. Equally, hares avoided sheep grazed fields with short swards for both foraging and resting indicating that reducing grazing intensity in pastural areas would also be beneficial for hare conservation. ]]>

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, however, in excess, it can pose a threat to water quality, most notably in freshwater systems. While researchers have focused on understanding the factors that influence stream P in non-urban areas, research on P dynamics in urban streams is lacking. Currently, urban development is the second-largest cause of stream impairment in the North America due, in part, to the impacts of nutrient pollution. For this reason, it is important to identify which commonly studied predictors of P in non-urban streams remain useful predictors in an urban setting and to determine whether characteristics unique to urban areas (i.e., socio-economic factors) can be used to predict P in urban streams. Seven streams on the island of Montreal were sampled daily to determine the P concentration in each. Stream flow was also measured in order to calculate the P flux in each stream. Stream P concentration and flux were compared to several physical and biological watershed characteristics that are commonly understood to be drivers of nutrient pollution, including percent impervious cover, land use, and amount of riparian buffer. Stream P concentration was also compared to several socio-economic watershed characteristics that I hypothesized would be good predictors in urban systems, including (average home value, median household income, fertilizer expenditures). Overall, two physical watershed characteristics (impervious surface cover and measures of land use) were most effective at explaining the variation in P concentration and P flux in the streams, while the biological and socio-economic variables were less effective. There is some evidence, however, to suggest that socio-economic variables (e.g. dollars spent on fertilizer per hectare of residential land) should continue to be examined with respect to urban stream P. After removing impervious surface cover as a predictor of stream P concentration, dollars spent on fertilizer per hectare of residential land, along with the percentage of residential land use, were included in the regression model. This suggests that after taking into consideration physical watershed characteristics, social factors may become important predictors of urban stream P concentration. Policies to reduce the movement of P to water (i.e. reducing impervious surface cover) may be successful for reducing the incidence of eutrophication in urban settings. Supplemental reduction of the source of P in urban catchments (i.e. ban the use of P fertilizers) may also contribute to an effective management solution.

AB  - Evolving agricultural policies and technologies have influenced land management practices within agroecosystems, impacting available habitats providing food and cover for many species of wildlife. More recent agricultural policy dictates that landowners adopt conservation practices that achieve long-term environmental goals. Increasing available wildlife habitat and enhancing habitat quality has become an explicit objective of existing agricultural policy. Thus, there is renewed focus on utilizing shelterbelt agroforestry systems as a tool to achieve conservation goals in the northern Great Plains. A farm-level agroforestry modeling system was developed to provide policy-makers and farmers with information on the impacts that state and federal programs have on farm income, the environment, and on wildlife habitat. Two Representative Farms--a 700-acre dryland farm and a 1260-acre irrigated farm were created in Saunders County, Nebraska. The Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (HAMS) was used to describe the composition and spatial pattern of the existing landscapes for each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape, as well as for the landscapes surrounding selected Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. Simulated land use changes resulting from the implementation of two shelterbelt policy scenarios, Agricultural and Wildlife, were also incorporated on each Representative Farm and surrounding landscape so that landscape variables could be measured which influence breeding bird species richness and community composition as determined from bird species grouped by habitat response guild. A more heterogeneous landscape results from implementing either the Agricultural or Wildlife shelterbelt scenario. The percent total woods was confirmed to be a significant determinant of bird species richness on the BBS routes and therefore was important in influencing the bird community at both the farm- and landscape-level. Other landscape metrics which influenced the bird community composition on BBS routes were woody edge percentages and edge density values. Policies promoting shelterbelts at the farm-level as well as on the agricultural landscape create edge habitats which ultimately favor birds within the Forest-edge/generalist and Grassland-edge guild, while bird species in need of conservation such as grassland-field species would potentially be negatively affected.

AB  - Soil erosion and increased sediment yields within a watershed lead to impaired water quality, decreased availability of wildlife habitat and reduced recreational opportunities. While some sedimentation occurs naturally within a water system, most erosion processes are the result of anthropogenic activities across a landscape, namely changes in land use and land cover (LULC). This study was conducted to determine temporal and spatial sedimentation trends in the Lake Issaquena watershed using sonar logging equipment, geographic information systems (GIS) and limited hydrologic data from the Soil Conservation Service (1941 and 1949). Sediment deposition was analyzed in relation to several key factors that influence erosion and sediment yields; these being dominant land cover, topography and slopes, soils and geology, rainfall and climatological aspects. Significant sedimentation has occurred in the Sixmile Creek delta, located at the northern end of Lake Issaqueena. Sedimentation rates inferred from an analysis of afore mentioned factors show considerable changes in erosion potential that correspond with substantial changes in riparian vegetation, extreme variations in rainfall events, conversion of land from agricultural to forestland and application of management practices. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, Fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina Department of Environmental Health and Safety (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they related to land cover change. Data was available for the Sixmile Creek site for dates ranging from 1962 to 2005 and from 1999 to 2005 for the Lake Issaqueena site. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4% evergreen, +62.3% deciduous, +9.8% bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/ grassland and cultivated (-42.6% pasture/ grassland, -57.1% cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5% in residential/ other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 meters to 0.3 meters. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Fecal coliform levels stayed relatively the same, there was however, a slight decrease overall, likely due to the decrease in pasture/ grassland. Turbidity remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decrease in pH can be observed at both stations. Sedimentation analysis has shown that overall the lake surface area has decreased by 11.333 hectares and lake volume has decreased by 320,800 m 3 , while catchment area increased by 6.99 hectares. Average annual precipitation rates were shown to have no direct correlation with these bathymetric measurements, and it is hypothesized that changes in land cover, slope and extreme precipitation events are largely responsible for sedimentation in Lake Issaqueena.

AB  - On California's Central Coast, growers have been incorporating non-crop vegetation (e.g. hedgerows, insectary plants, and cover crops) on their ranches in order to conserve natural resources. This research explores the extent of and motivation behind these conservation practices in the region and the potential benefits of one particular practice, the planting of hedgerows, to enhance biological control services. Using a social psychological framework, in 2007 a mail survey was sent to 600 growers in the Central Coast of California and had a 30% response rate. Survey results indicate that conservation practices have increased slightly over the previous five years and are mostly geared toward soil and water conservation. Growers report several benefits gained from conservation practices such as better soil and water quality, however they also cite many concerns, such as loss of profit, attraction of pest species and food safety conflicts, that may limit their use in ranches. Moreover, growers' conservation behavior on the ranch is likely influenced by social identities and attitudes toward the environment. Hedgerows may improve conservation biological control in highly disturbed, annual crop systems by providing insect predators and parasitoids with stable refugia and food resources. To test the habitat quality of hedgerow plants for insect natural enemies and pests, in 2005 and 2006, vacuum samples were taken on six common plant species at four hedgerows adjacent to organic vegetable fields. To track dispersal patterns of pests and natural enemies from hedgerows into adjacent vegetable fields, in 2006, insects were marked with a fluorescent pigment and captured on sticky traps at 25 and 100 m from the hedgerows. Finally, the effect of hedgerows on biological control services in adjacent vegetable fields was tested using a sentinel pest the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Results indicate that (1) insect natural enemy and pest species were present in hedgerows and were distributed differently across plant species, (2) natural enemies were generally more abundant than pests on hedgerows and on certain plants, like Baccharis pilularis , (3) insect predators had higher rates of movement from hedgerows at least 100 m into adjacent crop fields. While these results indicate that hedgerows have the potential to increase biological control services, the variability in parasitism rates of cabbage looper and the sensitivity of this parameter to the presence/absence of cole crops made it impossible to make any generalizations. Conservation-based farming will most likely increase in the Central Coast of California, although the rate of increase will depend upon addressing the concerns and constraints that growers have reported and being able to better quantify agro-ecological services gained from conservation areas, such as hedgerows.

AB  - The possibility of using wetland areas to reduce non-point source pollution by nutrients has been widely documented, but there is little information on the mechanisms of nutrient removal operating in these systems. This work investigated the nitrogen economy of the wetland species Phalaris arundinacea L., in the context of use in wetland buffer zones for the amelioration of non-point source nitrate pollution. The results of greenhouse experiments showed that this species grew equally well when nitrogen was supplied as nitrate, ammonium or a mixture of the two sources. Soil water status did not affect this response, but biomass production was greater in saturated than in drained conditions. P. arundinacea responded to increased nitrogen supply with increased biomass production, particularly aboveground. Phosphorus limitation did not affect growth or nitrogen uptake except at very high nitrogen levels. Luxury uptake of phosphorus was evident. Internal cycling of nitrogen was pronounced, with up to 70% of aboveground nitrogen translocated and stored over winter in the roots and rhizomes. The stored nitrogen was mobilised to support new growth the following spring. A similar pattern of autumn translocation of phosphorus and carbohydrate was identified, but there was no evidence for retranslocation with the onset of new growth. Plants collected from the field were found to be colonised by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Under controlled conditions colonisation was sporadic and insufficient to affect growth and tissue nutrient contents in either saturated or drained conditions. Belowground biomass in the field was concentrated close to the soil surface. In controlled conditions, waterlogged soils produced less growth and a shallower root system than drained soils. The results obtained suggest that P. arundinacea is a suitable species for use in riparian buffer strips, or more extensive wetland treatment systems, with variable soil water status and large inputs of nitrogen.

AB  - This Master's Degree Project (MDP) set out to develop an experimental design that would allow the effective evaluation of wildlife use between riparian buffers of different widths. The study area was centered on the McLean Creek area of Kananaskis Country, located near Bragg Creek, Alberta. An experimental design was developed to compare wildlife use of the riparian buffers in the McLean Creek licence. A wildlife pilot study was conducted from December 1998 to August 1999 using winter track counts, pellet group counts and a breeding bird survey. These techniques are reliable, easy and inexpensive to implement and provided useful information on wildlife use. Trail Monitors were also used and were determined to be best suited for providing supplemental information. Due to the early stage of timber harvest, 30 m and 60 m buffers were not available and study sites were limited to single 100 m and 200 m riparian buffer and 4 riparian areas in an uncut forest block. Power analysis was conducted using the available data set for ungulates to provide a general indication of variability in wildlife use and the number of riparian buffers required to detect a specified level of difference in use between buffers of different widths.

AB  - To assess components of the N cycle such as ammonification, nitrification and net nitrogen mineralization, as well as extractable nitrate and ammonium (NH4+ -N) pools, a study was conducted at Washington Creek, southwestern Ontario. Four different land use systems were studied: natural forest (NF), agricultural land + grass buffer (AP), livestock land (LS), and agriculture + rehabilitated buffer (RA). Soil net N-mineralization rates were calculated from ammonification and nitrification rates using the buried polyethylene bag method. Extractable nitrate and ammonium concentrations were obtained from samples taken as part of the sampling protocol for N-mineralization fluxes. Groundwater was also sampled from wells installed in the four land systems, and periphyton was sampled in stream waters associated with each land use system. Net soil N-mineralization rates were generally significantly higher (p≤0.05) in the RA (81 mg m-2 d-1 ) and AP (40 mg m -2 d-1 ) systems compared to the NF (24 mg m -2 d-1 ) and LS (18 mg m-2 d-1 ) systems, particularly in the fall. The same pattern was observed for extractable NO3- -N over all seasons. However, for extractable NH4+ -N, higher concentrations were found in the NF system in the fall of both 2003 and 2004; no differences were noted between land uses in other seasons. Chlorophyll a and ash free dry mass (AFDM) of periphyton were significantly higher (p≤0.05) in the LS system. Chlorophyll a and AFDM was poorly correlated with aqueous concentrations of nutrients, but was positively correlated with canopy openness. The groundwater flux (Q ) was highest in the NF and LS systems. In contrast, nitrate flux was highest in the AP system. This study showed that rates of N mineralization, nitrification and ammonification varied seasonally in each land use system. The RA and NF land use systems yielded different processing rates for the N species studied, when it was expected that these systems would have similar values after 25 years of rehabilitation. Future studies should focus on studying long-term N cycling recovery in rehabilitated riparian areas, such Washington Creek, and the relationship between buffer strip width, total buffered area, and stream basin hydrology.

AB  - The arable ecosystem is one of the most extensive in Britain and yet it is one of the least studied by ecologists. The development of British farmland towards uniform monocultures with low biological diversity has adversely affected many species of wild fauna and flora. In 1987 an experiment was set up at Wytham Farm, Oxfordshire which focused on the field margin as an area which might be enriched for the benefit of wildlife without lowering the profit gained by the farmer. In order to study the effects of these experimentally expanded arable field margins on small mammals, populations were regularly monitored by live trapping and radio-tracking and an assessment made of the numerical response of five species of rodent and three species of insectivore present to eight different management regimes applied to the margins. In addition the project provided insights of a more fundamental nature, into the behaviour and ecology of small mammals. The sizes of the populations were found to be influenced more by the presence of boundary features, such as hedges, ditches and tracks, than by any particular treatment of the margins vegetation. Areas with very short grass were, however, generally avoided. Field margins with hedges had comparatively high numbers of wood mice, bank voles and common shrews, and margins with ditches had higher numbers of bank voles than margins without. Radio-tracking of nine adult wood mice revealed a seasonal difference in their use of fields and field margins. In autumn and winter, when the fields were bare, the animals confined their movements entirely to the hedgerows and the conservation margins. Two alternative hypotheses for explaining low juvenile wood mouse densities early in the breeding season were compared (The `adult aggression hypothesis' and the `habitat saturation hypothesis').(D177826)

AB  - This study focused on steep (>10°) headwater streams in a volcanic geologic region in southwestern Washington. The presence and abundance of Rhyacotriton cascadae, Ascaphus truei , and Dicamptodon spp. (D. copei and D. tenebrosus ) were assessed in four treatment types (unbuffered (clearcuts), buffered (12 to 23 m wide), second-growth (35 to 50 years old stands), and unmanaged (not previously logged)). No difference among treatments for R. cascadae or Dicamptodon spp. presence was found. R. cascadae abundance did not differ statistically between buffered and second-growth streams or between buffered and unbuffered streams. R. cascadae densities did differ between second-growth and unbuffered streams and were lower in all managed streams compared to unmanaged. A. truei presence was different among treatments. Abundance of A. truei and Dicamptodon spp. did not differ among treatments. R. cascadae was present less frequently in streams with > 35.5 consecutive hours of water temperatures above 13.5°C.

AB  - This research investigated the potential of growing marketable aquatic garden plants that also remediate nursery and greenhouse runoff in a subsurface-flow constructed wetland. The cost of wastewater treatment is offset by the production of revenue-generating horticultural crops. Aquatic garden plants that offer the dual benefits of nutrient remediation and aesthetic value may also be used in bioretention basins, rain gardens, buffer zones, and filter strips. Fifteen commercially available aquatic garden plants were grown for 8 weeks in a laboratory scale subsurface wetland in a greenhouse and received nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from Hoagland's nutrient solution every two days for eight weeks. The N and P rates (0.39 to 36.81 mg L -1 of N and 0.07 to 6.77 mg L -1 P, respectively), encompassed low to high rates of nutrients found at various points between the discharge and inflow points of other constructed wetland systems currently in use at commercial nurseries. Plant biomass, nutrient recovery, and tissue nutrient concentration and content were measured. Among rhizomatous plants, highest N recovery rate were found in Louisiana Iris hybrid 'Full Eclipse', Canna 'Bengal Tiger', Canna 'Yellow King Humbert', Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott 'Illustris', Peltandra virginica (L.) Schott, and Pontederia cordata L. 'Singapore Pink.' The P recovery rates were similar for the cannas, Louisiana Iris 'Full Eclipse,' Peltandra virginica , and Pontederia cordata 'Singapore Pink.' Among the fibrous-rooted aquatic garden plants, highest N and P recovery rates were exhibited by Thalia geniculata f. rheumoides Shuey and Oenenathe javanica (Blume) DC. 'Flamingo.' Floating plants with the highest N recovery rates were exhibited by water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes [Mart.] Solms.) and water lettuce ( Pistia stratiotes L.). Phosphorus recovery rates were similar for water hyacinth, water lettuce, and dwarf redstemmed parrotfeather ( Myriophyllum aquaticum [Vell.] Verdc.). To determine the effect of N:P ratio on P recovery, Typha latifolia and Canna 'Bengal Tiger' were grown in a greenhouse-based laboratory-scale subsurface constructed wetland system with a 4-day hydraulic retention time for 8 weeks. Plants were supplied with the following N:P ratios: 6:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 1:6. Mean total P concentrations ranged from 6.9 mg L -1 (6:1) to 252.2 mg L -1 P (1:6); nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) was maintained at a constant mean level of 42.4 mg L -1 . Measured endpoints at 20, 40, and 60 d included height, biomass, nutrient recovery/allocation, and nutrient use efficiency. Canna and Typha whole plant N:P concentration was linearly correlated with N:P ratio of treatments. For the 1:3 and 1:6 treatments, Canna assimilated 40.7 and 30.6% of supplied P compared to 9.7 and 6.2% for Typha . Although both species exhibited luxury consumption of P, Typha latifolia was nitrogen-limited at the 1:1, 1:3, and 1:6 N:P ratios. The high P shoot and root concentrations of Canna in the 42N:252P treatment--19.8 and 11.6 mg g -1 , respectively, were significantly higher than the 3.0 and 4.4 mg g -1 cattail shoot and root P, respectively. These high shoot and root P concentrations for Canna 'Bengal Tiger' have not been previously reported. In summary, results of this research showed the differential uptake of N and P by commercially available aquatic garden plants and the ability of some species to recover N and P at levels comparable to traditional constructed wetland plants. Also, the N:P ratio of wastewater influent affects P assimilation and appears to be species-specific in nature.

AB  - Radio telemetry was used to monitor seasonal white-tailed deer use of riparian zones (RZ's) and adjacent pine plantations of 3 age-classes. Radio tracking was conducted on a 1300 hectare study area near Alto, Texas. RZ's comprised 22.0% of the area, while young, intermediate, and old pine plantations occupied 10.1%, 45.7%, and 13.2% of the area, respectively. Location estimates were obtained by triangulation using 3 simultaneous azimuths taken from fixed antenna stations. Chi-square tests and simultaneous confidence intervals were computed to evaluate use of each habitat type by season. The YP and OP habitat types were avoided during all seasons; the IP type was preferred during all seasons. There was also a preference shown for RZ's during the fall and winter seasons. The study clearly demonstrated the need for careful juxtaposition of small stands so that diversity and patchiness are maintained. The need for RZ's within pine plantation management was also demonstrated.

AB  - Highland vegetable systems in the Manupali watershed, Mindanao, the Philippines are important to supplement the demand for fresh vegetables in lowland cities, but the sustainability of these systems is constrained by declining soil productivity. A farm survey, soil characterizations, field experiments, and erosion modeling were undertaken to characterize vegetable production systems and soils; to test erosion control measures; and to evaluate impact of crop rotation on soil erosion. Two vegetable systems were identified: the Higher External Nutrient and the Lower External Nutrient systems. The former system existed at relatively higher elevations and showed negative profit. Despite a gradient in the degree of soil development across the four geomorphic units, soils were surprisingly uniform in their morphological and physical properties. However, they differed in fertility characteristics. Upper layers of mountain pedons showed 1.7 to 2% oxalate extractable Al, 1.4 to 2.7% oxalate extractable Fe, $>$94% P retention, 10.7 to 11.5 pH in NaF, and $<$0.9 cm$\sp{-3}$ bulk density, indicating more recent ash cappings on them. Effects of these properties on fertility were evidenced by a high phosphate sorption maxima (14208 $\mu$g P g$\sp{-1})$ and low potassium availability (AR$\rm\sb{e}\sp{K}=0.016$ (moles/l)$\sp{1/2}).$ The point of zero net charge was found at 4.2 for Bt and $<$4 for Ap and BA horizons. Halloysite, gibbsite, goethite, hematite, and cristoballite were common clay minerals. Base saturation was low and decreased with depth. Averaged over 2.5 years, the framers' practice of up-and-down planting showed the highest annual soil loss of 65.3 t ha$\sp{-1}$ compared to 37.8, 43.7, and 45.4 t ha$\sp{-1}$ for contouring, strip cropping and high-value contour hedgerows, respectively. Phosphorus had the highest average enrichment ratio of 4.7. Soil qualities differed between the slope positions of 19 m long erosion-runoff plots. Crop yields downslope were about 50% greater than those upslope. Tomato-cabbage-tomato cropping sequence showed 70 t ha$\sp{-1}$ greater simulated annual soil loss than cabbage-tomato-cabbage. High-value contour hedgerows, multiple cropping that includes corn or cabbage rather than tomato at the most erosive period of the year, and appropriate fertility improvement measures are suggested to improve the sustainability of these production systems.

AB  - Conservation biocontrol is the manipulation of agricultural practices to enhance pest suppression by natural enemies. I investigated the efficacy of in-field refuges (beetle banks) for the conservation of generalist predators and biocontrol of anthomyiid fly eggs. Beetle banks were established on three farms in the spring of 2002. In 2003 and 2004, the predator fauna was compared on farms with and without beetle banks. Beetle banks successfully conserved predatory beetles, especially in the early part of the growing season. In 2004, I also compared predation of sentinel fly eggs on the two types of farms and found no relationship between egg predation and the size of the predator population. Omnivory by predator beetles, specifically predation of other predators and other herbivore prey, was examined as one mechanism that might limit egg predation by conserved predators. In my study fields, the most commonly occurring predators were an assemblage of carabid and staphyilind beetles that all ate fly eggs and were under 1 cm in length. The assemblage also included Pterostichus melanarius , a larger (> 1.5 cm in length) carabid that did not eat fly eggs but did eat the smaller beetles. In a series of field cage experiments, P. melanarius was shown to negatively impact densities of, and thus fly egg predation by, small beetles. Small beetles also ate fewer fly eggs when aphids, common prey other than fly eggs, were abundant. However, when combined, aphids and P. melanarius ameliorated the negative effects of one another other on fly biocontrol. Increased foraging and incidental consumption of fly eggs by P. melanarius in the presence of aphids appeared to be the behavioral mechanism driving this result. My results show that interactions in food-webs containing generalist predators are often complex, with species linked by both direct and indirect interactions. As a result of this complexity the impact of generalist predators on a specific herbivore may be inconsistent and unreliable. This study is unique within conservation biocontrol research because I explicitly examined the mechanisms underlying the observed failure of beetle banks as a conservation technique.

AB  - Large ungulates can affect feedbacks between aboveground and belowground N pools, nutrient mineralization rates, and soil food webs at different temporal and spatial scales. Little is known about the effects of ungulates on nutrient dynamics in riparian zones which are important systems that provide habitat and forage for wildlife and livestock, and act as sediment and nutrient buffers between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Livestock grazing is a predominant land use on public and private lands in the western US while bison are more prevalent in National Parks and Monuments. The main goal of my studies was to investigate if bison and cattle alter N dynamics in riparian ecosystems of the Great Sand Dunes region or Sheep Creek of north-central Colorado. Studies of terrestrial ecosystems have shown accelerating, decelerating, or neutral effects of ungulates on N cycling (N pools or N fluxes). I hypothesized that cattle or bison grazing would accelerate N cycling in riparian zones because they are fertile and productive systems. Bison grazing in Great Sand Dunes riparian corridors and wet meadows did not increase potential net N mineralization while cattle did not affect net N mineralization in wet meadows. Cattle grazing in the Sheep Creek montane riparian zone did not increase aboveground production, aboveground or belowground plant N pools, soil N pools, soil microbial biomass, litter decomposition, net N mineralization or denitrification in the riparian zone as a whole. Cattle also did not affect stream or groundwater NO 3- and NH4+ concentrations. Signs of accelerated N cycling were detected only near the stream bank where potential soil net N mineralization was 35% higher in cattle grazed than excluded sites. This could be attributed to more frequent cattle utilization of streambank sites compared with areas further away from the stream. Although there was no strong evidence for accelerated N cycling in riparian zones grazed by bison or cattle, results suggest that increased N cycling is more likely in riparian sites that have a long history of grazing or are grazed frequently at moderate intensity. Season-long, light-to-moderate cattle grazing does not appear detrimental to N cycling and riparian functioning.

AB  - Wind may desiccate and cause direct mechanical injury to plants. Shelterbelts, which reduce wind speed, can be beneficial to crops grown near them. However, they are not often used in the United States because there is not adequate economic information that clearly shows their benefits. It is difficult to obtain the information because shelterbelts grow slowly, taking many years to show a yield improvement, and there are also an enormous number of combinations of crops, soil types and types of shelterbelts to consider. An alternative approach to evaluating the combinations is to develop a computer model that can simulate the production of crops grown under the influence of different shelterbelts on various soil types. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to develop a S helterBELT - S oybean (Glycine max L.) production model (SBELTS) by linking a microclimate model and a soybean production model with a tree foliage distribution model. The secondary objective was to develop a tree foliage distribution model for use with SBELTS. The tree foliage distribution model used the two parameter Weibull distribution to model crown surface area distribution curve. We found that the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution for a hybrid cottonwood clone (Populus euramericana , NC-5326) is close to a constant 2, and the scale parameter is strongly related to height for these trees. By combining the tree foliage distribution model that predicts tree height, shelterbelt width, and other characteristics, a micrometeorological model that predicts wind speed at various distances from a shelterbelt, and a soybean growth model that is sensitive to wind speed, SBELTS model was developed. No data were available to evaluate SBELTS so the model was evaluated by comparing predicted results with published information. SBELTS was used to predict soybean yield across a field with a shelterbelt. The predicted yield curve compared well with published yield curves. SBELTS was also used to predict yields for shelterbelts in wet, average, and dry years. The results showed no shelterbelt influence in wet years, some influence in average years, and a sizeable influence in dry years.

AB  - This study evaluates the economic and water quality effects of thirty-seven farming systems (FSs) which are combinations of three crop rotations, two tillage systems, three fertilizer application rates, two pesticide application rates and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The watershed is divided into 32 subwatersheds based on hydrologic relationships using a geographic information system (GIS). The surface water quality, specifically sediment yield, nitrogen and atrazine concentration in stream water, of alternative FSs at the watershed and subwatershed outlets are estimated using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) simulation model in conjunction with a GIS. The production costs and net returns of alternative FSs are estimated using the Cost and Return Estimator (CARE) and the 1990-1994 average input and output prices in the Midwest. An integrated mathematical programming model is developed to link the water quality objective at the watershed outlet to the spatial pattern of agricultural activities in the watershed and achieve the desired water quality objectives with minimum reduction in total watershed net return. The estimated net returns and water quality impacts of alternative FSs are incorporated into a mathematical programming model to evaluate the tradeoffs between economic return and water quality objectives. Alternative policy instruments for achieving the desired water quality objective at the watershed scale are evaluated. The economic benefits of maintaining riparian buffers in the watershed are assessed. There are substantial tradeoffs between economic return and water quality objectives at the watershed level. Tradeoffs vary across subwatersheds due to differences in soil, hydrology and topography. The study evaluates three policy instruments for watershed management, namely, regulating the spatial pattern of agricultural activities, an effluent tax and an abatement tax/subsidy. The three policies are equally efficient in terms of minimizing the loss in total watershed net return for achieving a given reduction in agricultural nonpoint source pollution but are different in terms of implementation feasibility. Regulation would infringe on farmers' property rights. The effluent tax would require water quality monitoring which is expensive and time consuming. The abatement tax/subsidy is the most feasible policy and is a cost-effective way to achieve the water quality objectives especially when riparian buffers are maintained in the watershed.

AB  - Riparian buffers have been proven to reduce nutrient and sediment transport to streams in agricultural watersheds. Southern Illinois offers a unique opportunity to study functions of riparian buffers in reclaimed mine soils. In Perry County, Illinois three stream segments of Bonnie Creek, Galum Creek and Pipestone Creek were restored to their approximate original position following mining. Between 1980 and 2000, as part of the restoration, vegetative buffers of grasses and trees were planted along the streams to minimize nutrient and sediment inputs from adjacent restored agricultural land. Our research objective was to determine whether riparian soil function was being restored in the vegetated buffers by comparing multiple soil properties to the adjacent reclaimed soils in agricultural production. Four transects were established on each study site through the buffer and agricultural field. Ten one meter plots were evenly spaced along each transect in each of the land uses. In summers 2010 and 2011, water infiltration rates, bulk density, total carbon concentration, total nitrogen concentration, and C:N ratio measurements were made to assess the restoration of soil function. Soil water infiltration was significantly higher and bulk density was significantly lower in the riparian buffers compared to the adjacent agricultural fields. In the riparian buffer, roots likely helped to break up the soil adding pore space, which reduced the bulk density and increased the water infiltration rates. Soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratio were significantly higher in the riparian buffers than the agricultural fields. The additional organic matter inputs from the roots of the riparian vegetation along with incorporation of litter from the soil macrofauna likely helped to increase the soil carbon and nitrogen levels compared to the agricultural fields. Even though the soil C:N ratio was significantly higher in the riparian buffers than the agricultural fields, more time is needed to restore the ratio to levels where nitrogen will be immobilized not mineralized in the riparian soils. Soil function in the riparian areas should continue to develop at a faster rate compared to the agricultural fields due to the impact of the perennial vegetation. Restoration of landscapes is not estimated by the return of structure alone, it also includes the re-establishment of function such as soil quality improvement, water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat restoration.

Soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratio were significantly higher in the riparian buffers than the agricultural fields. The additional organic matter inputs from the roots of the riparian vegetation along with incorporation of litter from the soil macrofauna likely helped to increase the soil carbon and nitrogen levels compared to the agricultural fields. Even though the soil C:N ratio was significantly higher in the riparian buffers than the agricultural fields, more time is needed to restore the ratio to levels where nitrogen will be immobilized not mineralized in the riparian soils. Soil function in the riparian areas should continue to develop at a faster rate compared to the agricultural fields due to the impact of the perennial vegetation. Restoration of landscapes is not estimated by the return of structure alone, it also includes the re-establishment of function such as soil quality improvement, water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat restoration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how dispersion of concentrated storm flow from an agriculture field across a forested filter zone (FFZ) affected the runoff process and the transportation of sediment and nutrients across the FFZ. The study site consisted of two small agricultural watersheds. Each contained an upland agricultural field with a grass-vegetated zone at the down slope edge and an adjacent FFZ that received runoff from the field. In each FFZ, two H-flumes installed in the ephemeral channel measured stormflow from the field as it entered the FFZ (upper flume) and stormflow discharged from the FFZ (lower flume). Water samples were collected by stage activated, automatic samplers at each flume. Flow through the upper flume could be returned to the natural, ephemeral channel (concentrated flow) or dispersed across contour through wooden level spreaders (dispersed flow). The storm flow (overland flow plus A-horizon interflow) from natural events was alternated between concentrated and dispersed flow for successive events. To test the effects of runoff dispersion at different soil moisture levels in the FFZ, irrigation pumps were used to produce planned, artificial events. The two relatively small forested filter zones, FFZ-1 (0.12 ha) and FFZ-2 (0.21 ha), were effective in improving the water quality of runoff from agricultural fields when the infiltration capacity of the FFZs was enhanced by dispersing runoff through the use of a level spreader. The dispersed runoff functioned more effectively in FFZ-2 where drainage density was lower and permeability was higher than in FFZ-1. Dispersal of runoff substantially increased infiltrability, decreased overland flow, reduced the peak flow rate, and delayed the time to peak when compared to concentrated flow. Dispersed flow was less efficient at increasing the infiltrability of FFZ-1 during low storm flow, high water table, and dormant season conditions. Dispersal of runoff substantially enhanced the deposition of total suspended solids (TSS) in the FFZ's for all storm sizes with one exception. Dispersed runoff performed poorly when sediment concentration was less than 0.2 g/l in FFZ-1. A similar correspondence was observed in the deposition of total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP).

AB  - The Town Creek Watershed (TCW) is a representative area of the Tombigbee River Basin and the Southeastern Plains Ecoregion in Mississippi. The principal channel and four main tributaries have been included for several years within the MS Section 303(d) list of waterbodies biologically impaired due to sediment. The TMDL developed for TCW recommended that streams located near cultivated lands, road crossings and construction activities are a priority for streambank and riparian buffer zone restoration and sediment loads reduction. Development of remedial measures and future BMPs within TCW for reducing water quality impairment and downstream dredging costs requires identification of sediment sources and loads currently transported within TCW. Streambank erosion processes were hypothesized to be an important mechanism driving sediment supply from TCW. The overall goal of this research was to identify mechanisms and the potential effects of streambank erosion processes and to quantify and model the magnitude and rates of these processes within TCW. Research goal and specific aims were addressed in four substudies combining field reconnaissance and detailed data collection, laboratory analysis and computational modeling techniques. The first substudy involved a temporal and spatial analysis of observed suspended sediment transport rates, and determined the stage of channel evolution and identified streambank erosion as an important source of sediment supply for reaches in TCW. Streambank erosion contributions of up to 28.5 Mg per m of streambank were quantified in a second substudy monitoring and determining streambank erosion processes and factors within TCW. Results from a third substudy assessed predictions of the computational model CONCEPTS for time of occurrence and magnitude of streambank failures and top width retreat along a 270-m modeling reach. Empirical and analytical approaches used to estimate rates and depths of fluvial erosion were developed in a final substudy. The rate and depth of fluvial erosion were estimated as a function of hydraulic and hydrologic properties of flow events, vegetation on streambanks, flow induced forces and streambank geometry and soil properties. Reduction of suspended sediment loads should focus on attenuation of geomorphic processes and stabilization of reaches and agricultural lands adjacent to streambanks along incised headwaters within TCW.

AB  - Gramnivorous sawflies are an important food source for the chicks of some fundamental bird species. Numbers of gramnivorous sawflies on lowland farmland have been declining since the 1970s. A few studies into the ecology of sawflies on lowland farmland have taken place in Southern England. This research was designed to complement the English studies and to increase our knowledge of the ecology of gramnivorous sawflies in Scottish farmland.In semi-field studies of sawfly life history, larvae appeared to survive better on Poa annua and Dactylis glomerata than on spring barley but the statistical support for this was weak. In overwintering experiments, the number of larvae recovered from the soil was very low. All the individuals recovered were found in the top 16cm of the surface.In distribution studies of adult sawflies, there appeared to be some differences in the species composition of across Scotland but this was not statistically supported. There was no variation in species composition between similar grass habitats on a farmwide scale. Sawflies collected from within 1 field were either aggregated or randomly distributed. There were extreme male biases on all geographic scales for the most commonly captured species, Dolerus aeneus.Adult capture-recapture experiments did not provide enough data for statistical analyses, but the percentage of recaptures indicated that adult Dolerine sawflies are fairly sedentary. The prevailing weather conditions did not have a significant affect on the flight of sawflies.In farm-wide collections of sawfly larvae, Numbers were higher in grass fields than in any other habitat. There appeared to be a general trend of greater larval numbers in field edges than in the middles, but this was not always statistically supported. The mean number of larvae at a site could be positively correlated with percentage grass cover. Some larval species can be associated with particular host plant presence or absence.

AB  - Field studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of several grasses as filter strips for reducing sediment and herbicide losses in runoff from cotton. Giant reed and eastern gamagrass reduced total runoff volume 64 and 69%, respectively. Each grass reduced total sediment loss at least 66%. All five species reduced total fluometuron loss at least 60%. Giant reed, eastern gamagrass, and big bluestem reduced total norflurazon loss 92, 86, and 63%, respectively. When a filter strip was present, fluometuron and norflurazon loss did not exceed 5 and 3%. respectively, of the total applied. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the tolerance of these perennial grasses to topical applications of 1x and 1/4x rates of selected herbicides. Each of the herbicides reduced tall fescue biomass by at least 30%, regardless of rate. Glyphosate at 1120 g ai ha -1 applied in early-June reduced biomass by 66%. With the exception of the 1/4x rate of glyphosate applied in mid-April, all treatments reduced switchgrass biomass at least 25%. With the exception of 1/4x rates of pyrithiobac in 1997 and glyphosate applied in mid-April of 1998, all treatments reduced giant reed biomass at least 32%. Glyphosate applied in mid-April at 1120 g ha -1 reduced giant reed biomass by 82 and 95% in 1997 and 1998, respectively. In 1997, all treatments reduced eastern gamagrass biomass at least 27%. In 1998, 1120 g ha-1 glyphosate reduced eastern gamagrass biomass at least 95%, regardless of application timing. Labeled rates of fluazifop-P and MSMA reduced eastern gamagrass biomass by 96 and 91%, respectively. A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the effects of a filter strip on adsorption and desorption of fluometuron. Fluometuron adsorption was higher when a filter strip was present, which could be attributed to more organic matter under the filter strips. Kd values for fluometuron ranged from 1.88 to 3.55 with soil from a cropped area, compared to 2.87 to 5.34 when a filter strip was present, indicating a weak to moderate binding affinity for fluometuron. Total fluometuron desorbed ranged from 48 to 79%. Approximately 11% less fluometuron was desorbed when a filter strip was present.

AB  - <p class=Abstract>This doctoral thesis aims at elucidating reasons for previous poor success in reintroductions of grey partridges <i>Perdix perdix</i>, a conservation priority species in the UK, and addresses important behavioural issues hindering success in wildlife reintroductions. I released captive-bred grey partridges onto sympathetically managed farms in Oxfordshire and east Gloucestershire, UK, as pairs in spring 2007 and as family groups, i.e. coveys, in autumns 2006 and 2007. By using radio telemetry, I then monitored habitat use, observed vigilance behaviour and time budgets and recorded nocturnal roosting behaviour in the released birds as well as monitored their survival. Before the releases in autumn 2007, the grey partridges were also tested in captivity for their temperament and monitored after release to investigate whether temperament could have predicted survival. The post-release behavioural studies revealed that released grey partridges were vulnerable to an ecological trap created by field margins in spring, showed poor vigilance and inappropriate feeding behaviour compared to previous knowledge on wild grey partridges, and performed anti-predator roosting behaviour variably and inconsistently. The temperament tests indicated that the captive population of grey partridges consisted of individuals with variably fearful disposition, although the animal¿s behaviour in the tests did not predict post-release survival. This thesis demonstrated how post-release behavioural monitoring can reveal weaknesses in the behaviour of the released animals, as well as the importance of developing rearing methods to maintain wariness, adaptive feeding routines and anti-predator roosting behaviour in the captive-bred population.</p>

AB  - I studied the abundance, diversity and dispersal patterns of managed and wild bee populations in and around commercial highbush blueberry and cranberry fields in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, and assessed their potential as pollinators of these crops by determining which groups of bees had the greatest impact on crop yield. I found greater species diversity than previous studies but bee diversity was not correlated to berry weight. Bumble bees dispersed well within both crops. Other wild bees were well-distributed in blueberry fields but generally remained at cranberry field edges. Wild bee abundance was correlated between fields and surrounding areas, suggesting that wild bees were readily able to cross into fields although bee abundance varied greatly between fields. Blueberry and cranberry weight were related to bumble bee abundance but not to honey or other wild bee abundance. Bumble bees are recommended as potential alternative pollinators of these crops.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) pollution and the subsequent eutrophication of freshwater systems are serious and persistent environmental problems. Most commonly we parameterize our models of these flows with mean values or smooth linearized trends. However, at the watershed scale, P dynamics may be discontinuous and difficult to predict. This thesis includes insights from a simple linear model of P flow in the Lake Mendota watershed and a consideration of certain discontinuities and surprises. The linear model couples in-lake and upland processes to assess the long-term impacts of various management strategies. Policies that lead to balancing the P budget in the watershed are critical for long-term restoration of Mendota. However, altering the flow of P across riparian zones would slow the accumulation of P in the lake, and biomanipulation and alum application can reduce algal densities. In a comparison of two years of daily P-yield (μg ha-1 day -1 ) from six Southeast Wisconsin watersheds with contrasting riparian buffer attributes, mean daily P-yield was most closely correlated with the variability in riparian patch size. Variability in P-yield was most closely correlated with riparian buffer characteristics. To evaluate the impact of tile drainage on water quality, I compared P concentrations during high flow events in two consecutive stream reaches. Phosphorus loads from tiles were highest during heavy rains and, during the two heaviest rain events, in-stream phosphorus concentrations were markedly higher in the tiled reach. Zebra mussels are likely to invade Lake Mendota. I coupled mussel-mediated phytoplankton removal estimates with chlorophyll production estimates in a dynamic model developed to predict the impact of zebra mussel invasion on water clarity. With frequent epilimnetic circulation, the percentage of bloom condition days decreased. However, with infrequent epilimnetic circulation greater mussel density was required for increased water clarity. My work suggests long-term restoration of the Lake Mendota watershed will require balancing the upland P budget by reducing P import in fertilizer and feed. It suggests that discontinuous shifts resulting from buffer configuration, drain tiles, or species invasion may produce rapid changes in the lake that would not be anticipated from a linear analysis of the P cycle.

AB  - Studies were conducted during 2007 and 2008 to investigate the distribution and density of phytophagous stink bugs and boll injury in cotton as part of a variable farmscape. The goals of this research were to: (1) compare and contrast sampling techniques and correlate the density of stink bugs and associated internal boll injury with measurements of crop phenology, (2) establish the spatial and temporal distributions of stink bugs and boll injury on a whole-field scale, and (3) determine the density of stink bugs and boll injury along field margins as influenced by adjacent habitats and crops. The ground cloth was the most efficient method to directly sample stink bugs. Monitoring bolls for internal injury was the more sensitive method to detect the presence of stink bugs than the ground cloth or sweep net. The density of adult stink bugs was positively correlated to plant height and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI). The density of bugs and boll injury were significantly greater in grids located along the periphery of fields than in grids located near the center of the fields. Along field margins, the densities of stink bugs were greatest on the first row and decreased as the distance towards the interior of the cotton field increased. Also, density of stink bugs and boll injury were greatest in cotton adjacent to soybean and peanut fields. These results demonstrate that spatial and temporal variation exists in populations of stink bugs and boll injury along field margins and within fields, and can vary significantly based on the adjacent crop.

AB  - Study on degradation and sorption of atrazine within different species of grass-hedges Vegetative Buffer Strips (VBS) (big bluestem (Andropogon geradi ), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.)) was conducted. Over seven years eastern gamagrass appeared to be accumulating organic C in both the surface 15 and 15-30 cm soil depths. Soil under eastern gamagrass had the highest mineralization rate of atrazine and the highest atrazine-degrader populations. Atrazine was degraded rapidly in eastern gamagrass soil with the atrazine half-life of 10 days. Atrazine adsorbed to thatch more readily than VBS soil. These data suggested that eastern gamagrass should be used preferential to big bluestem grass and switchgrass for establishing grass-hedges VBS. Preferential flow of bromide and atrazine in the 5 and 9-year-old switchgrass Riparian Buffer Strips (RBS) and their adjacent cropped areas were observed. However, there was little difference in transport characteristics between these two RBS soils and their adjacent cropped soils. Despite similar texture and organic C contents, atrazine sorption was greater in RBS soils than adjacent cropped area soils. Greater sorption would lessen the potential leaching of atrazine to groundwater. Degradation of atrazine was slower under switchgrass RBS compared to the adjacent cropped soil. The rapid degradation of atrazine in the corn-soybean soil adjacent to the 5-year-old RBS was due to a larger population of atrazine-degrading microorganisms, which were also responsible for rapid mineralization of atrazine. Simulation results of atrazine fate after entry into the RBS using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) indicated that the RBS would retain about 79-94% of atrazine in runoff from the adjacent cornfield. The RZWQM predicted very low atrazine concentrations in seepage (<3 μg L -1 ). Our results suggested that RZWQM underpredicted leaching in the soil profile. Further modifications of the leaching subroutine are needed to correctly predicted pesticide loss in the seepage. Atrazine loss in runoff leaving the RBS was mostly sensitive to macropore size and plant residue load, but less sensitive to organic matter content. However, further study of the relationship between macroporosity and runoff losses of pesticides effectively are needed to verify the model sensitivity to macropores.

AB  - Shelterbelts of trees and shrubs are a dominant landscape motif in the Red River Valley of the North as well as other parts of the Great Plains. Shelterbelt designs have varied and their purpose has changed since the concept was introduced to the area in the mid-nineteenth century. Orchard-like groves, planted on land alienated to settlers under the federal Timber Culture Act of 1873, were supposed to increase precipitation in the region as a whole. Later shelterbelt designs composed of one to ten rows of trees were intended to interrupt windflow along the earth's surface and provide protection to people, soil, crops, and livestock. They also provide inhabitants a sense of psychological enclosure. Shelterbelts are not evenly distributed through the Red River Valley. Patterns of shelterbelt distribution were studied in five mapping units located in Kittson County, Minnesota; Pembina County, North Dakota; and Franklin, Montcalm, and Rhineland Rural Muncipalities, Manitoba. Shelterbelts found in each unit were classified by morphological characteristics as farmstead windbreaks, Timber Culture groves, and wide, intermediate, and narrow field windbreaks. Remnants of Timber Culture groves are rare. Virtually all farmsteads are protected by a shelterbelt or native galleria woodland. The number and types of field shelterbelts varied greatly among mapping units. Density of field shelterbelts, expressed as length per square mile, ranged from about a quarter of a mile in the eastern mapping units to 2.5 miles in the westernmost unit. Areal distribution of most shelterbelt types was limited by national and state boundaries. Reasons for these variations were explored. It was found that planting increased in periods of perceived agricultural maladjustment to the Great Plains environment. Present distribution of specific shelterbelt types resulted from existence of government planting programs and subsidies. Shelterbelt utilization by individual farmers was linked to perception of soil resources, erosion, and conservation practices. Loss of older forms to age and changing management practices should be halted by preservation efforts.

AB  - Headwater streams have had a history of degradation due to human activities. Although impacts of intensive agriculture on stream health have received more attention, urban expansion into agricultural watersheds has led to an increasing emphasis on better understanding urban stream processes. In the present study 24 stream sites within eight watersheds in central Indiana (USA) representing an agriculture-urban land use gradient were examined to determine trends between urbanization and stream quality and to identify potential physical and biotic indicators of urbanization on fish community change. Current land use and impervious area for the study watersheds were determined by classification of satellite images. Historic streamflow records suggest that increased imperviousness has led to increased runoff and downstream channel instability in the most urbanized watersheds. This study found significant correlations between impervious area, channel morphological change, reduced habitat quality, and the loss of sensitive components of fish communities. Relative to nearby agricultural streams, streams with the highest percentage of watershed imperviousness had increased stream power and bankfull discharge per unit watershed area, loss of in-stream habitat quality (QHEI) and riparian buffer integrity. Significance of relations between environmental variables and fish species traits were assessed using the fourth-corner method, a new permutation technique designed to link traits of species to the habitat characteristics of the locations at which they are found. Urban stream fish communities lacked sensitive species including those highly dependent on the substrate for feeding and reproduction (darters, sculpin and several Cyprinid species; P = 0.001). Associations between urbanization and the fish community identified in this study that were recommended for further development as urbanization indicators include: impervious area, high density urban land cover, forested land cover of the catchment and riparian buffer scales, and new variables of stream power, bankfull discharge per unit watershed area, qualitative habitat index (QHEI), Johnson channel stability index, percent eroded banks, number of darter species, functional fish community measures of reproductive guild, habitat orientation, substrate preference, and tolerance to silt. These results provide insights into the ways in which urbanization impacts stream fish communities and identifies potential tools for monitoring development-related impacts on stream ecosystems.

AB  - Northern bobwhite and many early-succession songbirds have experienced severe population declines in recent decades, generally because of habitat loss. Field borders can increase and enhance early-succession habitat for birds on farmland. However, field border shape and the landscape context in which field borders are established may determine their effectiveness for bird conservation. We established linear and nonlinear field borders on farms in agriculture-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. We collected pre-treatment data on songbird density, nest success, brood parasitism frequency, summer bobwhite abundance, and fall bobwhite covey abundance in 2004. After field border establishment (2005 and 2006), we continued to collect these data as well as data on artificial bobwhite nest success and field border vegetation characteristics. After the establishment of field borders, summer bobwhite abundance increased significantly on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes and on farms with nonlinear field borders. Summer bobwhite abundance did not increase on farms in forest-dominated landscapes with linear field borders. Artificial bobwhite nest depredation rates were similar across all treatments, as were the major vegetation characteristics of the field borders themselves. Fall covey abundance, songbird density, nest success, and brood parasitism frequency were unaffected by the establishment of field borders. However, songbird density and nest success were significantly higher in agriculture-dominated landscapes. Our results suggest that linear and nonlinear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite populations on farms in agriculture-dominated landscapes. Nonlinear field borders can be used to increase bobwhite populations in forest-dominated landscapes. The same landscapes that were most conducive to bobwhite management were also the highest quality for songbirds. We compared the time-of-detection method for sampling bobwhite coveys with an empirical logistic regression method. The time-of-detection method provided an estimate of detection probability that was similar to the empirical method. The time-of-detection method is less expensive to perform than the empirical method. However, the empirical method may be more useful when the number of covey detections is low, and it can use information from a single count to calculate the detection probability for that count.

AB  - Vegetation of old fields in the temperate rain forest of the Queets River Valley, Olympic National Park, Washington, USA remains dominated by exotic herbs 60 years after abandonment. Exploratory vegetation analyses revealed that seven species dominated the old field vegetation: the persistent European pasture grasses Agrostis gigantea and Anthoxanthum odoratum , and five species that have invaded since abandonment: the exotic Cirsium arvense and Rubus laciniatus ; and the native Carex obnupta , Pteridium aquilinum , and Picea sitchensis . The expanding patches of Cirsium, Carex , and Rubus appeared to be successional changes that will not lead to tree establishment. Tree colonization by Picea is more probable in fields that have older alluvial soils with higher organic matter, moisture and acidity; were burned prior to clearing; and were less disturbed by past agricultural use. Study of field edges revealed that invading Picea seedlings were virtually limited to older soils that had Anthoxanthum or Pteridium cover. The most important soil and cover factors to Picea invasion were Agrostis cover (negative correlation) and soil organic matter (positive correlation). Agrostis formed sod and increased ground cover, which may inhibit Picea seedling establishment. In experiments with sown seeds, seedlings of Picea and Tsuga heterophylla emerged as readily in Agrostis as in Pteridium or Anthoxanthum , but suffered higher mortality in Agrostis . Seedling establishment was very low in all cover types and almost nonexistent without experimental reduction of competing vegetation. Exclusion of rodents increased seedling emergence in some sites but not others. Cervid herbivory suppressed growth of Tsuga and Alnus rubra , both on transplanted seedlings outside of fenced exclosures and on natural seedlings in permanent plots. In contrast, Picea was not browsed and grew steadily in height with little mortality. Growth of Picea seedlings may be facilitated by Pteridium . Picea, Tsuga , and Alnus have small seeds and are poorly adapted to establishment in dense vegetation. Competition appears to be the prime inhibitor of tree colonization; it may be intensified by Agrostis , the most abundant cover type on the fields, and by the dry summers of the Pacific Northwest. If past and present dynamics continue, succession of most of the meadows to forest may be arrested indefinitely.

AB  - With a 700% rise in global fertilizer use in the last 50 years, agricultural lands are a significant source of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Record high levels of nitrate-contaminated runoff from agricultural sources in California's Central Coast are affecting drinking water supplies in the Pajaro Valley and increasingly threatening the ecological health of the Monterey Bay. Bands of vegetation strategically planted to control runoff and soil erosion, or vegetative filter strips (VFS), are used in urban landscapes and at some farm peripheries. On-farm vegetative diversity has been promoted for its contribution to biodiversity and pest control. The efficacy of in-row VFS for nutrient removal, however, has never before been explored in caneberries, the fastest-growing agricultural commodity in Central California. This on-farm study experimentally tested the ability of three different types of common and native VFS planted between the rows to reduce nitrogen runoff in California caneberry fields: California field sedge ( Carex praegracilis ), creeping wild rye (Leymus triticoides ), and wild mustard (Brassica juncea ). Overall, nitrates in runoff decreased significantly with greater VFS cover. Of the three species tested, L. triticoides grew fastest, but B. juncea yielded the greatest cover by the end of the rainy season. VFS were shown to be a cost-effective tool that growers can use in California caneberries to decrease nitrate runoff while inherently promoting on-farm biodiversity.

AB  - Sampling studies were conducted to assess pepper weevil (PW) adult numbers on various pepper plant structures, to compare visual sampling methods, and to characterize adult dispersion on a small- and a large-field basis. More PW adults were observed on terminal fruiting buds than on other plant structures, but numbers varied diurnally on the exposed portions of the plant. The number of PW adults on exposed terminal buds was significantly higher in the morning than the afternoon. A comparison of terminal bud inspection, whole plant inspection, and an absolute sample for PW adult counts indicated that terminal bud inspection required the least amount of search time and provided higher PW counts per unit time. Initial tests, using colored sticky traps as an alternative sampling method, indicated that yellow traps were comparable in efficiency (weevils found per unit search time) to terminal bud inspection. Dispersion estimates suggested that PW adults were dispersed randomly in small pepper fields (0.2 Ha) to slightly clumped in larger, commercial size fields (0.9 to 58 Ha). A concentration of PW adults in the outer field margins was observed at three distinct farm sites. Taylor's Power Law coefficients did not vary significantly over time of day, but the slope of the Log mean by Log variance regression was significantly less for terminal bud inspection than for whole plant inspection or the absolute adult sample. An action threshold, based on inspection of two terminal buds per plant, was tested and refined for commercial application in Florida. In the spring of 1989, under a heavy PW infestation, marketable yield of plots treated with permethrin, based upon a threshold of 1 adult/400 buds, was not significantly different from plots treated weekly. Results indicated that PW adults can be sampled effectively using terminal bud inspection, and diurnal (daytime) effects do not significantly alter the efficacy of a threshold based on this sampling method. In bell pepper, an action threshold (1 adult/400 terminal buds) lower than previously established (1 adult/100 terminal buds) was needed to achieve pepper production similar to weekly insecticide treatment under a heavy PW infestation.

AB  - The field of Landscape Architecture can further develop a niche for the design of sustainable productive landscapes. This study attempts to understand a major stakeholders' perceptions and use of riparian buffers and other conservation practices for water quality in an agricultural watershed of Mississippi. A survey was distributed to agricultural producers in the Big Sunflower Watershed of the MS Delta. The survey informs the interested parties of producers' perceptions and uses of riparian forested buffers, perceptions and uses of conservation practices that restore water quality, perceptions of their environment, perceptions of surface water quality, enrollment of governmental incentive programs, and utilization of digital technology. Analysis of this data could lead to a better understanding of the knowledge and attitudes farmers have of the riparian systems and watershed processes at work within the region and factors that influence the farmers' decisions of implementing conservation plans.

AB  - The occurrence and mechanism of transmission of two bacterial genera, Azorhizobium and Rhizobium, that induce stem nodulation of Sesbonia rostrata, a tropical legume, were determined in field and laboratory studies. Leaves and stem cuttings of S. rostrata and other plants as well as samples of surface water (marshes) and soil were collected from different vegetation zones in Senegal. The population densities of the bacteria were estimated by the MPN plant-infection technique. Azorhizobium was distinguished from Rhizobium by cultural characteristics on specific growth media. A large population density of Azorhizobium ($>$10$\sp7$ cells per g of dry leaves) but a small population density of Rhizobium ($<$10$\sp4$ cells per g of dry leaves) was detected on aerial portions of S. rostrata in the field. Whereas the population density of Rhizobium ($>$10$\sp7$ cells per g of dry soil) far exceeded that of Azorhizobium ($<$10$\sp5$ cells per g of dry soil) in soils collected from all of the vegetation zones of Senegal. The density of stem-nodulating bacteria in surface waters was $<$10$\sp3$ cells per ml, and the numbers on the surfaces of plants other than S. rostrata was $<$10$\sp3$ cells per g of dry leaves, respectively. S. rostrata grown in soil from seeds inoculated with Rhizobium or Azorhizobium did not have a large number of stem nodules, the number being less than three nodules per plant on the stems, whereas a suspension of bacteria aerosolized in a growth chamber produced up to 60 nodules per plant 28 days after exposure to the bacterial aerosol. The inocula for stem nodulation were generated by aerosolization of Azorhizobium from a suspension of about 10$\sp8$ cells per ml, growth of uninoculated S. rostrata together with S. rostrata that was first spray-inoculated with Azorhizobium and then exposed to wind or simulated rain drops, and dust particles generated from inoculated soil ($\le$300-$\mu$m size fractions). The percentage of plants with stem nodules was directly related to the length of time the uninoculated plants were exposed to the bacterial aerosols, to splash droplets generated by the rain drops, or to dust particles derived from soil. The average number of nodules formed on stems exposed to these three treatments for 4 days was 60, 28, and 11 per plant, respectively. The data suggest that stem nodulation of S. rostrata results from bacteria present in the air.

AB  - Many species of bird breeding in Britain have declined in recent decades. However, only in the farmland ecosystem are the majority of species, primarily seed-eating passerines, declining. Similar declines in these species are also occurring elsewhere in Europe and North America. This thesis aims to model the effects of habitat change on population size of these species through an understanding of their behaviour.A wide range of factors, primarily relating to the intensification of agricultural management, have been implicated in these declines, and these are reviewed in detail. There is little evidence for consistent impacts on the breeding biology, but considerable circumstantial evidence that declines in winter food supply have been a major cause of the declines.Three species of seed-eating passerine are studied in detail, skylark Alauda arvensis, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and corn bunting Miliaria calandra. In winter, yellowhammers and corn buntings used stubble fields exclusively; skylarks much preferred stubble fields. All avoided winter cereal fields. This is related to seed density, stubble fields held virtually all the cereal grain found in the soil and many more weed seeds than winter cereal fields.The functional responses of skylarks, yellowhammers and corn buntings are described. Seed availability plays an important role in determining intake rate, with seeds buried beneath the surface harder to obtain, particularly for yellowhammers. Seed availability has more general implications for the nature of functional responses.Bird numbers were related to seed density, the aggregative response. The scale at which aggregative responses were observed varied between species. The availability of seeds in the soil column affected the birds use of fields, with the number of seeds on the surface important. The location of hedgerows was also important, yellowhammers and corn buntings preferred to forage close to them, skylark did not.The general effects of overwinter mortality on population size are modelled and the effects of two causes of winter mortality, starvation and predation are analysed.

AB  - It is important for state departments of transportation (DOTs) to make decisions regarding transportation route locations that minimize negative impacts to wetland fauna. Here a new methodology to quantify wetland health is developed using landscape characteristics for 49 wetlands in northern Missouri and relating them to wetland health. Wetland health was defined in this project as the presence of sensitive or rare amphibian species, such as tiger salamanders or northern crayfish frogs, which are very sensitive to habitat disturbance. The biology assessment involved in this project was performed as part of other research. Crops, forest, grass, and herbaceous land covers, length of stream, length of roads, length of flowpath from wetland to stream, change in elevation between wetland and nearest drainage channel are landscape characteristics that are considered because they are assumed to affect positively or negatively wetland habitat for amphibians. A commercial geographic information system (GIS) ArcGIS 9.2 was used to quantify the landscape characteristics. Two types of wetlands were identified: nonpairs and pairs. Non-pair wetlands were defined as those wetlands in which the 600 m buffer zone and beyond did not overlap with the buffer zones of other wetland. A pair wetland was defined as one in which the concentric rings of the buffer zones overlapped with the concentric rings of another wetland. Five buffers were generated around each wetland encompassing 0-300 meters, 0-600 meters, 0-900 meters, 0-1500 meters, and 0-2100 meters. A distance parameter was incorporated in the variable values because it was hypothesized that distance from the landscape feature to the wetlands could be a factor for the prediction of the health of the wetlands. The variables were then normalized which allows for the addition and subtraction of dimensionless landscape characteristics with different units (e.g., length of roads, grass area). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed at the different spatial scales mentioned above, to test the relationship between wetland health and landscape variables. It was found that proximity to roads negatively affects wetland health up to a distance of 900 meters, while crops can have a negative effect up to a distance up to 2100 meters.

AB  - The management of riparian buffer strips is one of the most sustainable methods of managing non-point source pollution. Current riparian management often falls short of acknowledging the complexity of the many biogeochemical processes that regulate pollutant transformation and retention. This study explores how carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and iron cycles interact, and how stream channel evolution regulates nutrient and greenhouse gas dynamics. I instrumented three riparian sites near Ithaca, NY, along an inner meander, a straight stream section, and an outer bend with an oxbow formation. Water and gas samples were collected tri-weekly. Groundwater flow paths and water table fluctuations varied among meander settings. Antecedent moisture conditions were a strong driver of N, Fe, PO 43- , N2 O, and CH4 dynamics. Sites exhibited different biogeochemical conditions, with elevated NO3- loss, N2 O and CH 4 emissions within the oxbow formation, suggesting the geomorphology and the meander setting significantly influenced subsurface biogeochemistry and associated pollution trade-offs.

AB  - Prairie wetlands are designed to withstand, if not thrive, on the climatic instability common to the prairies. It is often the human alteration of their hydrology that impacts wetland productivity. Surrounding l and use such as cultivation can potentially alter the dynamics of wetland in-flows and the amount of water entering a wetland. This then alters the hydro-ecological processes of spring rise, summer drawdown, length of dry periods, and vegetative reproduction and establishment. Cultivation can also physically damage or destroy wetland vegetation and impact riparian and wetland soils. Most of the prairie wetlands that have escaped drainage in the prairie pothole region (PPR) now lie in watersheds devoted primarily to agricultural crop production. As a result, human activities have affected nearly every prairie wetland directly or indirectly. The overall objectives of this research were to explore the influence of surrounding land-use on wetland vegetation and to better understand spring snowmelt and soil characteristics in wetlands of varying hydrological permanence. The main purpose is to improve our predictive capability for wetland restoration in prairie Canada and to provide recommendations for the future management and protection of wetlands in agricultural landscapes. The objective of study 1 was to assess the impact of agricultural land-use on the distribution and diversity of vegetation in seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 21 wetlands in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agricultural croplands surrounded 18 wetlands, while native grasslands surrounded three wetlands. No significant differences in total, invasive, weed, exotic or native species were observed between seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Native grassland wetlands had more total and native plant species in outer vegetation ' zones compared to wetlands surrounded by croplands and virtually no invasive, exotic or weed species in their shallow marsh zones. In comparison, invasive, weed and exotic species were more prevalent in wetlands surrounded by croplands, with the numbers of invasive and weed species significantly higher in shallow marsh and wet meadow zones, and exotic species higher in wet meadow zones. The loss of native species and the increase of invasive, weed and exotic species in wetlands surrounded by agriculture can be partly attributed to the loss of the low prairie and wet meadow zones. Research shows that agricultural impacts, such as excess sediment and nitrogen additions from soil erosion and changes in soil moisture and soil compaction, also favor the growth of invasive species in the outer vegetative zones of prairie wetlands. These factors help explain why the restoration of native species in the outer wetland vegetation zones is so difficult. Our ability to successfully restore and protect impacted wetlands in agricultural landscapes will be limited if these vegetative margins are not protected from further degradation. The first objective of study 2 was to examine the accuracy and predictions of a single-basin hydrologic model designed to simulate spring snowmelt events into wetlands. The model was applied to nine seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Water level data for the ponds and the spatial distribution of the vegetation within all study wetlands indicate that 30% of the average annual snowmelt equivalent that occurs from December to April enters study wetlands. This 30% snowmelt event was consistent in all wetlands regardless of basin size, wetland class, surrounding land-use, or regional location. The second objective of study 2 was to investigate the spatial extent of the effective transmission zone and its relationship to landscape features and wetland attributes, such as wetland water chemistry. Solute differences observed in the soils surrounding study wetlands were the result of two distinct ionic dominance patterns in wetland water chemistries. Calci m, bicarbonate and calcite precipitate reflected the influence of snowmelt chemistry in seasonal wetlands, while gypsum and other soluble salts in the soils surrounding semi-permanent wetlands reflected the influence of evapotranspiration and the concentration of solutes in more permanently flooded habitats. Results indicate that lateral soil water movement and the effective transmission zone are important in both seasonal and semi-permanent prairie wetlands. A similar spatial pattern for the effective transmission zones was displayed in both seasonal and semi-permanent ponds, with the outer extent of the zone around each wetland type located at a specific and consistent upland elevation relative to the basin itself. The outer extent of the zones were located closer to the wetland edge where slopes were steep and extended further away from the wetland edge where slopes were more gradual. Little is known about the landscape or wetland factors influencing the extent of the effective transmission zone in wetlands and further investigation is warranted.

AB  - On-farm research is the tool of choice to assess farm practices and develop recommendations readily applicable to farm conditions. Collaboration of the extension service and farmers is essential because farmers will provide the required records on crop and soil management. Hedgerows have been successfully introduced in Haiti as a soil conservation measure. Objectives of this project were to: (1) statistically evaluate their performance from an agronomic standpoint, (2) devise a practical method to measure their effectiveness as erosion control device, and (3) evaluate decision making approaches for selecting crop and farm management practices best suited for sustainable production on hillside farms in Haiti. Extreme variability in yields lead to the adaptation of conventional data collection for unreplicated dispersed experiments in farmer's field. The model structure for on-farm data analysis, where farmers are chosen at random, is typically mixed. On-farm data often generate unbalanced data. The MIXED model procedure in SAS was used for the analysis, because it is better suited for unbalanced data in mixed model situations. Results show significant yield increase from introducing hedgerows compared to controls with no hedgerows. To assess hedgerow efficiency in controlling erosion, the volume of soil saved per unit length of hedgerow was derived using simple geometry and trigonometry. This volume was related to hedgerow and field characteristics by regression. A regression model involving four parameters was developed. Hedgerows were shown to retain between 300 and 500 t ha$\sp{-1}$ on the hillsides over a period of four and a half years. Risks to the farmer community from introducing new or improved technologies need to be minimized and accurately evaluated. Utility functions involving decisions by the farmer for a simple crop management practice (plant density in this study), combined with the stochastic dominance analysis, were used to assess risk. Planting hedgerows and the adoption of optimum plant density were efficient ways to stabilize yields, hence income, and minimize risk for hillside farmers. By keeping the soil on the hillsides, hedgerows reduce soil erosion, allow sustainable crop production, and preserve the soil resource base. Because of their stabilization of crop yield, their adoption rate is high.

AB  - The leaching of nitrogen constrains the development of sustainable agricultural systems in the humid tropics, particularly where crop root growth is restricted by subsoil toxicity. Trees in fields will improve nitrogen use efficiency if these trees actively take up leached nitrogen from deep soil layers: the safety-net hypothesis. This hypothesis was tested within hedgerow intercropping systems on an Ultisol in Lampung, Indonesia. The location of root uptake activity was determined using 15N enriched ammonium sulphate applied to the soil, and related to root distributions studied using coring and wet extraction. The native tree Peltophorum dasyrrhachis was found to have a higher proportion of roots in the subsoil than the introduced tree species, Gliricidia sepium. The area-weighted mean vertical angle of tree main roots were found to indicate fine root vertical distribution, providing a quick method for assessing root distribution complementary in agroforestry trees. The ratio of 15N uptake from deep placements to 15N uptake from shallow placements was correspondingly larger in Peltophorum than in Gliricidia. Over 175 days, Gliricidia took up an estimated 21 kg N ha-1 and Peltophorum an estimated 42 kg N ha-1 from beneath the main crop rooting zone. Gliricidia roots were coincident with roots of a maize intercrop, and maize yield was reduced by intercropping with Gliricidia. N use efficiency, determined after surface applications of 15N urea, was reduced in the Gliricidia intercrop since competition reduced crop uptake. Temporal processes are critical to safety-net function. Maize only took up 15N from 15N placements at 65 cm depth only from around 60 to around 90 days after sowing. While competition is likely to occur in intimately mixed agroforestry associations, this can be minimised by using trees which regrow slowly or are pruned regularly during the growth of the crop. Benefits of N interception and recycling by trees will still occur if trees grow well during any fallow periods in the cropping cycle. Tree N uptake can be regulated by shoot pruning; trees took up little 15N from applications at any depth for 2 weeks after pruning. Downslope hedgerows recovered around twice as much urea - 15N as upslope hedgerows, demonstrating the importance of lateral leaching.

AB  - Conservation biological control involves manipulating farm landscapes or management systems to enhance populations of beneficial predators of agricultural pests. Farmscaping is one aspect of conservation biological control where predators of important pests are identified, the availability on the farm landscape of resources and habitat components needed by the beneficials to complete their lifecycles is evaluated, and hedgerows, beetle banks, or other conservation plantings can be added to the landscape to provide the lacking resources. To be able to efficiently survey a farm landscape for the presence of resources that support beneficial predator populations there needs to be information on the resource availability with different habitats. This dissertation describes a series of investigations into determining the amount of resources available in particular habitat types, and how to create conservation plantings which provide these resources with minimal expense and impact on the farming system. The first investigation is into the floral resource availability to parasitoid wasps in cane berry production landscapes. A meta analysis was performed to estimate the effects of different species on longevity of and attraction to various flowers. This information was then used to evaluate the plant species found on Willamette valley cane berry farms and calculate the total floral resource availability of different habitats during different times of the year. Surveys identified particular habitats on the landscape, and different management regimes as having high floral resource availability relative to other habitats or management regimes. The second investigation focuses on the biology of a group of ground beetles that are common on Willamette valley vegetable farms. Pitfall trapping and soil core samples were used to determine the seasonal activity patterns of the carabids, and to identify which habitats they were using most. Sentinel prey cards were used to compare pitfall trap counts with the risk of predation of a potential prey item. Laboratory experiments identified differences in the feeding and activity of different species, and the changes over the season. The third investigation used soil cores to sample the over wintering arthropod predator populations in a variety of habitats on Willamette valley farms, and in plantings of native species on beetle banks in a common garden at the Hyslop research farm in Corvallis, Oregon. Grassy habitats were found to support the highest arthropod populations both on the farms and in the common garden. Some perennial forbs also had high arthropod numbers, while other perennial forbs and annual forbs had low numbers. Differences in the number of over wintering arthropods in different species were related with differences in the structure and composition of the vegetation. The information presented here can be used to assign value to different habitats based on the provision of specific resources required for beneficial predators to complete their life cycles. This will aid in rapid evaluations of farm landscapes based on aerial imagery interpretation or a quick tour. After initial predictions are made it is easier to conduct more in depth sampling to confirm whether the beneficials are in fact present and thriving. If there are resources that are in too short a supply the information provided here will help in designing conservation plantings to provide those resources.

AB  - The Goldthorn Wedge is approximately 627ha. Of the original green belt in the western margin of the UK West Midlands' conurbation. Phase 1 and Phase 2 ecological surveys were used to identify the plant ecological interest. Historical records and maps from the Anglo-Saxon period through to the modern day were used to identify historical features within the landscape. ArcView Geographical Information Systems were used to display and integrate ecological and historical information including the reconstruction of partial or complete ecological phase I surveys for different historical periods. The ecological surveys demonstrated that the most important botanical features in the Wedge are the wet grassland vegetation of the Penn Common Golf course, the three semi-natural deciduous coppices and practically the entire system of hedgerows. The historical investigation showed that almost all these features are of great age. It is suggested that Penn Common has the oldest documented history in the Wedge and that its wet grassland has partially retained some of its original features. The modern coppices appear to be remnants of much more extensive forest lands, but their ecology suggests a greater antiquity than it is possible to prove. Some individual hedgerows were shown to date back as far as the Common and the vast majority of the fields are over 160 years old with many over 260 years old providing a living record of the history of the Wedge. The Wedge was shown to have its origins largely as "ancient countryside" rather than that of "planned countryside" (Rackham, 1995b). The design of future integrated studies and further investigations of the Goldthorn Wedge is discussed.

AB  - I developed acoustic identification methods and studied habitat use in a speciose bat community from southern Italy. I studied echolocation calls from 23 Italian bat species and devised multivariate discriminant functions used for habitat use studies. I described diagnostic Pipistrellus kuhlii social calls. I demonstrated sympatry of Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus in Italy. I also examined resting frequencies from Rhinolophus euryale and R. mehelyi: juveniles called at lower frequencies than adults. The implications of these findings for acoustic investigations are discussed.Habitat selection at the community level was determined by acoustic surveys. Activity was highest over rivers and lakes. High levels were also recorded in towns, arable land and olive groves. M. daubentonii and M. capaccinii were affected by wind, and temperature influenced Hypsugo savii activity. P kuhlii, P. pipistrellus and Tadarida teniotis showed no significant habitat preference. Rivers were selected particularly by Myotis bats and Miniopterus schreibersii.Habitat selection by R. euryale was studied by radiotracking. This species selected broadleaved woodland. Urban, open areas and conifer plantations were avoided.The results have clear implications for bat research and conservation in southern Italy and other Mediterranean areas. Acoustic identification by quantitative echolocation and social call analysis promises to be a valuable means to investigate habitat use by bats with high intensity echolocation calls in speciose Mediterranean bat communities. Rivers and riparian vegetation need to be adequately protected and managed. Habitats managed or created by man were also important and should therefore feature in conservation plans. I recommend avoiding the clearance of continuous, large areas of woodland, and not planting conifers. Urbanisation is a threat to R. euryale and other sensitive species, and should be limited in areas of special value for the bat fauna. Linear landscape elements such as tree lines and hedgerows should also be preserved.

AB  - Headwater streams and their riparian zones are a common, yet poorly understood, component of Pacific Northwest landscapes. I sought to describe the ecological significance of headwater stream riparian zones as habitat for forest-floor invertebrate communities, and to assess how alternative management strategies for riparian zones may impact these communities. I compared community composition of forest-floor invertebrates at five distances along 70 m traps-riparian (stream edge to upslope) gradients in three treatments: mature forests; clearcuts; and across riparian buffers of ∼30 m width. In the buffer treatments, I looked for evidence of microclimatic edge effects, and also biological edge effects, as characterized by species distribution and movement patterns across the forest-clearcut boundary. Invertebrates were collected in pitfall traps, in five replicate blocks of three treatments each, in the Willamette National Forest, OR. Air and soil temperature, and relative humidity were measured at a subset of pitfall locations at each site. A pitfall grid was installed at one riparian buffer site for a mark-release-recapture study to record carabid beetle and lycosid spider movements across the buffer edge. Ordination revealed a distinct "riparian" invertebrate community within 1 m of the stream edge in mature forest treatments, which was strongly related to a cool, humid microclimate. The stream appeared to influence microclimate at least 20 m upslope in the mature forest treatments. Invertebrate community composition in buffer treatments was far more similar to that of mature forests than was that of clearcuts, a pattern mirrored by microclimate. Microclimatic edge effects were not evident in the buffer, suggesting that the stream's cool, humid influence on microclimate may be modifying any warm, drying effects coming in from the forest-clearcut edge. While biological edge effects were not clear for invertebrate communities, individual species showed various responses to the buffer edge, depending on their habitat affinities and mobility. These results suggest that invertebrate distributions are strongly associated with microclimate, and that riparian buffers of ∼30 m width provide suitable habitat for many forest species. However, buffer edges may serve as barriers to dispersal for some forest interior species, or be permeable to invasion by open-habitat species, with possible consequences for long-term population and community dynamics within the buffer.

AB  - Investigations on the variation in wild populations of white clover in East Anglia were begun in 1975. Much genetic variation, both within and between populations, was revealed for a number of characters; in some, there appeared to be as much variation in the local populations as there is in a world-wide collection of wild white clover at the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Aberystwyth. It was postulated that the east of England forms part of a secondary centre of diversity for white clover. Several aspects of genetic variation were related to habitat. In particular, small size of plant parts was associated with dry, infertile soils and with close grazing or cutting. In populations from fertile soils, the amount of branching was related to the closeness of grazing or cutting. Populations from paths and hedgerows were more variable than those from fields, and within-population variation was also related to environmental heterogeneity. Responses of two contrasting populations to edaphic factors, particularly the concentration of major mineral nutrients, were studied in sand culture and in soil. Most genotypes grew relatively faster in their parent soil than in alien soil, though the reason for this could not be determined. Responses differed within as well as between the two populations. Most of the differences in response in terms of dry weight were attributable to a single character, namely the mean length of internodes on the main stolon. It was concluded that much of the genetic variation between populations was a result of selection in different environments, though random drift and introgression from sown cultivars into wild populations were also considered contributory factors. The gene pool of white clover in East Anglia is considered potentially valuable as a source of germplasm for breeding new varieties.

AB  - The use of contour and riparian buffer strips planted with perennial vegetation has been found to improve surface water quality by reducing NO 3 -N and sediment outflow from cropland to a river. Modeling such a system to compare alternative layout and different strip sizes often faces challenges in flow routing scheme. The hillslope scheme in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) offers the flexibility of allowing the flow from a crop area to be routed through a buffer and/or contour strip, in which a thin sheet flow represents more closely the natural condition of a watershed. SWAT was applied to the Walnut Creek Watershed and the hillslope option was used to examine the effectiveness of contour and riparian buffer strips in reducing NO 3 -N outflows from crop fields to the river. Numerical experiments were conducted to identify potential subbasins in the watershed that have high water quality impact and to examine the effects of strip size and location on NO3 -N reduction in the subbasins under various meteorological conditions (dry, average and wet). Varying the area and location of the contour and buffer strip affects NO3 -N outflow and crop yields as well since it takes the land out of production. The size of the filter strip has economic implications in deciding how much land area to dedicate to prevent NO3 -N loss to a desired limit or vice versa. The results of this study can assist in cost-benefit analysis and decision-making in best management practices for environmental protection. SWAT was then applied to the Upper Mississippi River (UMRB) to study the perpetuation of the current trend of growing corn to meet the increasing corn demand for ethanol industry. A hypothetical case of converting the entire UMRB agricultural land into corn production was simulated by SWAT. Though very unlikely, this study provided a guideline to identify the highest nitrate contributing subbasins that could be used for switchgrass production instead of corn. Such conversion would yield economic value from cellulosic ethanol from swtichgrass and at the same time there would be an improvement in water quality. High impact subbasins were identified based on the total nitrate output of each subbasin. Converting them to switchgrass production was found to reduce nitrate nitrogen yield of up to 14 kg/ha and sediment reduction of up to 5 tons/ha. In many cases, switchgrass reduced up to 71% of total nitrate nitrogen yield and almost 99% of sediment. The Production-Economy-Environment matrix analysis of growing switchgrass for various rates of fertilizer application and its consequences on the yield of biomass and environment was performed. It demonstrated that the efficacy of rate of fertilizer application and its relationship to economy and environment was not proportionate. It underscores the importance of such analysis to design an optimum amount of fertilizer to be used. Conversely, it can be used to determine the rate of fertilizer application for a desired gain or desired target in environmental quality. A simple economic analysis found out that there was a significant economic gain from the cellulosic ethanol compared to corn ethanol. It was concluded that even though the economic benefits of bio-energy crops were marginal, the bio-energy crops are yet a potentially viable solution for the degrading water environment in the waterways of Upper Mississippi River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up, calibrated and validated for the Maquoketa (4867 km2 ) and Beaver Creek (905 km2 ) watersheds to develop SWAT hydrologic parameters specific to one of the six principal Iowa landform regions. These landforms (eco-regions) cover the majority of the intensively cropped regions in the state and are based on similar bio-physical characteristics that are assumed to have a corresponding specific range of SWAT input parameters unique to each one of them. Having a readily usable set of SWAT hydrological parameters would make the modeling part of TMDL develo ment easier. A sensitivity analysis on Beaver Creek was performed by modifying the land use distribution similar to Maquoketa and the results showed that SWAT model was performing coherently in both the watersheds. Thus a SWAT hydrological parameter set was recommended for the Iowan Surface landform region. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - A critical need exists throughout the tropics for interdisciplinary research that collects, evaluates, and makes available to decision makers the information contained in locally developed land-use systems. This dissertation presents the results of an ecological and economic study of one such system, the forest gardens and associated spectrum of land-uses in the Gunung Palung Region of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The first two chapters of the dissertation introduce the overall project. Chapter 1 provides a baseline description of the study site, methods used, components of this land-use system, and related agroforestry systems in other areas of the world. Chapter 2 describes the non-timber forest product extraction system in the region and its relationship to the forest gardens. The next four chapters analyze the forest garden system from different disciplinary perspectives. Chapter 3 uses a GIS based analysis to look at ecological production patterns. Chapter 4 uses econometric frontier analysis to estimate production frontiers for and technical efficiency of farms and forest gardens. Chapter 5 uses a nutrient flow model to examine the long-term sustainability of the forest gardens. Finally, Chapter 6 uses interviews and censuses to examine mammalian use of forest garden buffer zones. The last three chapters apply findings from the different disciplines to look at "real world" problems. Chapter 7 examines the effects of a El-Nino-Southern Oscillation linked drought on the local economy. Chapter 8 considers the economic costs and benefits of a transmigration project to involved parties. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes non-academic components of the project. I conclude that although there are many ways in which the system could be improved, overall it is an economically viable and ecologically sustainable model for land-use planning in the region.

AB  - Modern agricultural practices have had a significant impact on the structure and suitability of agricultural landscapes as habitat for both plant and animal species. Many species of farmland wildlife have demonstrated population declines, which parallel increased herbicide use and altered land management. Habitat loss may often be a greater threat to wildlife than pesticide use in agricultural landscapes. Mitigation may not focus on a particular pesticide product but more on the effect of an agricultural practice. The objective of this research project was to quantify the response of avian species to habitat enhancement and to provide forms of compensatory mitigation for pesticide effects on wildlife. During the first phase of habitat enhancement, unsprayed field borders were established along hedgerows on 4 sites and 4 other sites were conventionally farmed and used as reference sites. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus ) survival and nesting success were monitored and compared between unsprayed and reference sites. Results indicated that less than 20% of bird locations were on or adjacent to hedgerows on either reference or unsprayed sites. Bobwhite dispersed from hedgerows on reference and unsprayed sites before the borders were established. The next phase of this habitat enhancement research project involved planting a 10 m grass/forb border adjacent to the hedgerow on 3 sites. Three similar sites were conventionally farmed and referred to as reference sites. Bobwhite health indices and the nutritional value of crop contents for bobwhite and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus )were measured on all sites. Results indicated that grassy field borders were not effective in increasing body condition indices of northern bobwhite and crop content results were heavily biased by specimens that contained soybean contents. During the spring, grassy border and reference sites were monitored for songbird activity. Avian abundance, species richness and nesting success of songbird species were compared between grassy border and reference sites. Overall, songbird populations were positively correlated with the increased grass/forb composition of the grassy borders. However, the extent of important differences in songbird populations was difficult to determine due to small sample size and limited seasonal data.

AB  - The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on river systems is gaining attention, and concerns about the state of freshwater natural resources are increasing globally, as are efforts to restore habitat that has been degraded by disturbance. In rivers, non-point source pollution affects the physical characteristics of the habitat and the endemic biotic assemblages. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are numerous and exhibit graded responses to various types of disturbance in the river, and may be used as indicators of habitat conditions. In this dissertation, macroinvertebrates were examined as bioindicators in the Umatilla River in eastern Oregon. The first study is a bioassessment of the impacts of agriculture on the benthic macroinvertebrate community in adjacent streams. The results of this study show that there are physical differences in habitat associated with adjacent land use, and the macroinvertebrate communities responded to these differences with changes in taxa richness and evenness. Indicator species analysis identified thirteen taxa which were indicative of habitat conditions associated with ideal habitat used as a reference condition, degraded habitat associated with agricultural land use, and transitional habitat associated with conservation/restoration management. The second study is a laboratory study in which the effects of temperature of a common mayfly nymph, Epeorus albertae (McDunnough) (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae) were evaluated. The study showed that not only the developmental rate of the nymphs was affected by temperature treatment (within a range of 18°C and 28°C), but the location of accumulated body tissues over time varied by temperature, with significant difference in the type of growth observed for insects held at the highest temperature. The third study examined the response of six indicator taxa to environmental variables as predictors of abundance in a non-parametric multiplicative regression. This study found that for all taxa examined, the two best predictors of abundance in the Umatilla River were turbidity and conductivity. Increased turbidity and conductivity are common effects of intensive agriculture in streams located in agro-ecosystems, but may potentially be mitigated by vegetative buffer strips and sustainable land use practices. Long term agricultural disturbance in the landscape has been shown to have lasting effects in the ecosystem which may be further exacerbated as global climate change increases dependence on freshwater resources. Understanding anthropogenic impacts on organismal communities and natural resources is vital to establishment of effective conservation, restoration, and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem.

AB  - Agriculture is a significant source of nonpoint pollution of surface waters. Contributions of N and P to surface waters propagate cultural eutrophication and water quality degradation. Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) have been designed and implemented to prevent farm sources of N and P from entering surface waters. Agricultural BMPs were examined on several farms in the Skaneateles Lake watershed. The effect of soil depth was examined for a filtration effect under several different cover types and BMPs. While the study found that NH 4+ -N and PO4- losses to groundwater were potentially small, the risk of NO3 - -N leaching to groundwater under several cover types and management practices was high. General effectiveness of BMPs was influenced by a combination of variables: season, soil drainage, soil texture, and the extent of grassed, forested, or riparian buffers separating site of application of N and P from surface waters. Keywords: Nitrates, orthophosphate, attenuation, remediation, non-point pollution, buffer, water quality.

AB  - Numerical and experimental tests were done to determine the optimum design parameters of a shelterbelt for wind damage mitigation to structures behind the shelterbelt. The Wang and Takle shelterbelt numerical model was used to study the shelterbelt's cross-sectional shape, height, spacing/line tightness, density/density distribution, line width, number of lines, and wind speed parameters. The numerical model was also used to study the effectiveness of more realistically shaped shelterbelt tree lines, rather than using the traditional blocks to represent each line of trees in the shelterbelt. Finally, experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel to test the effects of wind-induced load reduction with the implementation of a shelterbelt screen, studying forces rather than flow fields.

AB  - The incidence of predatory mites and phytophagous mites on grapevine and the surrounding wood has been studied in the vineyard-region of southern Lower-Austria. 32 wood species of 18 families in hedges and forest margin have been examined. On 24 wood species (Acer sp. C. betulus, C. vitalba, C. mas, C. sanguinea, C. avellana, C. monogyna, F. excelsior, J. regia, M. nigra, P. convolutum, P. avium, P. mahaleb, P. spinosa, P. pyraster, Q. robur, R. cathartica, Rosa sp., R. fruticosus, S. nigra, T. platyphyllos, U. laevis, V. lantana, V. vinifera) the occurrence of 11 predatory mite species from the family of the Phytoseiidae was noted: Euseius finlandicus (Oudemans), Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten, Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans), Amplyseius andersoni (Chant), Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt), Paraseiulus soleiger (Ribaga), Paraseiulus talbii (Athias-Henriot), Phytoseius plumifer (Can. and Fanz.). High predatory mite densities were seen on the following: blackberry bush (R. fruticosus), the common hazelnut (C. avellana), walnut tree (J. regia), linden tree (T. platyphyllos), wooly snowball (V. lantana) and dogwood (C. sanguinea). On grapewine T. pyri could be noticed in every location of observation, E. finlandicus only locally. The generation number, the development of the mite populations and the importance of the structure of leaf undersides for mite incidence are set for discussion. Compared with vineyards, plants in hedges or forest margins adjacent to vineyards, carried a significantly higher variety of predatory mites and a substantially higher number of mites.

AB  - Variety of summary indices for benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI), substrate, and water chemistry parameters were used to discriminate between 4 land-use categories of forest, clear-cut, turf establishment, and golf course operation. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) was used to distinguish important benthic indices, substrate, and water chemistry variables. Water chemistry parameters resulted in having greater power at discriminating between the land uses compared to benthic indices and substrate, suggesting water chemistry analysis should accompany golf course bioassessments. This is contrary to the belief that biology is all that is required for an insightful assessment because of its intrinsic value. In addition, Jaccard, chi-square, Bray-Curtis on abundances, and Bray-Curtis on benthic indices distances were evaluated to determine the best distance measure to summarize BMI community data in bioassessments. Overall, Bray-Curtis distance measure on benthic indices scored highest against 5 criteria. Using a multivariate reference-condition approach for test-site assessment, BMI community structure was different at test sites between and among the 4 land-use categories suggesting differences in land management practices, e.g. lime and fertilizer application. Results from correlating River Bank Quality Index (RBQI) with benthic indices and water chemistry parameters suggested that riparian buffer strips could be a useful golf course best management practice on the Precambrian Shield to reduce stream enrichment.

AB  - Sediment, phosphorus (P), and fecal pathogens lost from grazed pastures contribute to the non-point source pollution of surface waters. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to observe the effect of different grazing management techniques on the amount of time cattle spend in or near pasture streams and on the amount of sediment, P, and fecal pathogen loading of into the streams. During the 2008 and 2009 grazing season, a study was conducted at the Iowa State University Rhodes Research and Demonstration Farm utilizing six adjoining 12.1-ha pastures that were bisected by a 141-m reach of stream. The pastures were grouped into two blocks and assigned one of three treatments: continuous stocking with unrestricted stream access (CSU), continuous stocking with stream access restricted to 4.9-m wide stabilized crossings (CSR), or rotational stocking (RS). Pastures were stocked with 15 fall-calving black Angus cows from mid-May to mid-October for 153 days in both years. For two weeks of each month, GPS collars were placed on at least one cow per pasture. For one of the two weeks, alternative off-stream water was made available to cattle in CSU and CSR pastures to determine the effect of off-stream water on cattle distribution. Each month the cattle were stocked on the pastures, bare and fecal-covered ground was measured. Rainfall simulations were conducted in June, August, and October of 2008, April, June, August, and October of 2009, and April of 2010 at six vegetated and six bare locations on the stream banks in CSU and RS pastures and six vegetated locations on the stream banks within the riparian buffer in CSR pastures. In June and August of both years, two cows per pasture were given a bolus of Cr-mordent fiber to determine total and P fecal output. Shedding of the fecal pathogens was measured by collected fresh fecal samples from all 90 cows in June, August, and September of both years. Stream bank erosion was measured by erosion pins at 10 equidistant transects that were measured monthly from May to November. Results show that off-stream water had no effect on cattle distribution. Compared to the CSU treatment, the CSR treatment reduced the probability ( P < 0.10) that cattle were within the Riparian Zone (0 to 36 m from stream center) at black globe temperature humidity index (BGTHI) of 50 to 100. Bare ground in and near the stream was generally greater in pastures with the CSU than CSR and RS treatments. Rainfall simulations resulted in greater ( P < 0.10) proportions of applied precipitation and amounts of sediment and P transported in runoff from bare than vegetated sites across grazing treatments and from vegetated sites in CSU and RS pastures than vegetated sites in the CSR pastures. The proportion of applied precipitation, sediment and P loading into surface runoff was most closely related to the proportion of bare ground (R 2 = 0.5217, 0.4512, 0.4082, respectively). Pathogen shedding of cattle occurred only once throughout the experiment and was never found in precipitation runoff from rainfall simulations. Bovine enterovirus, an indicator virus, was shed by an average of 24.3% of cows over the study and was collected in the runoff of 8.3 and 16.7% of the simulations on bare sites in CSU pastures in June and October of 2008, respectively, and from 8.3% of the simulations on vegetated sites in CSU pastures in April 2009. Stream bank erosion did not differ between treatments. Results of the experiment show that time spent by cattle near pasture streams can be reduced by RS or CSR treatments, thereby, decreasing risks of sediment and nutrient loading of pasture streams even during periods of increased BGTHI. Stream bank erosion via cut banks was the greatest contributor of both sediment and P loading of pasture streams; contributions of sediment and P from surface runoff and grazing animals were considerably less and were minimized by grazing management practices that reduced congregation of cattle by pasture streams.

AB  - Streams integrate landscape processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Human activities have extensively altered landscapes in North America, with serious consequences for aquatic ecosystems. I investigated land use in southern Appalachian watersheds to identify proximate effects on stream habitat and ultimate effects on fish assemblage structure and organization. I examined how catchment land use type, extent, spatial pattern, and history affect physical and chemical characteristics of streams, and how instream factors (i.e., habitat) influence distribution and abundance of stream fishes. Field data were used to test predicted relationships and to construct empirical models of relationships among landscape and stream variables. Forest cover accounted for the most variation in nearly all models, supporting predictions of nutrient enrichment, thermal pollution, and sedimentation caused by landscape disturbance. Physicochemical models fit better when landscape predictors were catchment-wide rather than localized, indicating cumulative impacts. Four faunal associations were identified across the landscape. Three classes were dominated by endemic Appalachian highland fishes, forming a continuous gradient in assemblage structure from smaller, cooler, higher-elevation streams to larger, warmer, lower-elevation streams. A fourth association was characterized by non-endemic fishes where habitats were affected by nutrients and sediment in association with forest cover loss in streamside buffers and high density of buildings and roads. Endemic, small-bodied (low fecundity), cool-water trophic specialists that depend on coarse substrate for spawning declined where stream habitats were modified. They were supplanted by cosmopolitan, large-bodied (long-lived, high-fecundity), warmwater trophic generalists that do not require rocky substrates for successful spawning. Streams draining urbanizing catchments, or those that had been severely disturbed in the past, had lower ratios of endemic to widespread taxa even though riparian buffers were largely forested, suggesting legacy effects from past catchment disturbance. Replacement of unique locally-adapted taxa with widespread generalized species has been termed biological homogenization, and may severely affect regional and continental biodiversity, particularly in regions with rich endemic faunas such as the Southeast. Research identifying functional responses to cumulative effects of landscape change is needed to promote proactive conservation at the watershed scale, management that is critical to maintaining the integrity of aquatic habitat and biodiverse communities.

AB  - Rodents can cause serious damage to agricultural crops and may be perceived to be carriers of food-borne pathogens. Growers and landowners are inclined to remove vegetation to keep rodents out of their fields. In response to the Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak in California, there was industry pressure to remove riparian and field-edge habitats on farms. However, the efficacy of these measures to enhance food safety is unsupported. Few studies have documented the impact of field-border hedgerow plantings on mammal activity on adjacent crops. To better understand mammal abundance and distribution on farms associated with field-border habitat plantings, mammals were monitored using a combination of live-trapping, remote-triggered cameras, monitoring blocks, and mound counts across four sites at 0, 10, 75, 175-m distances away from both conventionally managed field edges (mowed or sprayed for weeds) and hedgerows consisting of California native shrubs and perennial grasses native to California. Fecal samples were taken from captured rodents to test for E. coli, Salmonella, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Although some species did prefer hedgerow habitats, they were not observed within orchards at greater rates than observed for semi-weedy control plots. I observed low prevalence of E. coli (non-O157 STEC: 1.4%, n = 353; O157 STEC: 0%, n = 353) and Salmonella (0.8%, n = 353) within study plots. Giardia (29.2%, n = 137) and Cryptosporidium (24.1%, n = 137) were more prevalent in captured rodents, but distribution was not affected by field-edge habitat. Hedgerows do not appear to have a negative impact on crop damage or food-safety concerns in California walnut orchards.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most damaging pest of potatoes in North America. Studies were conducted form 1996 to 1999 to: (1) test the deployment of a trap crop treated with systemic insecticides to delay Colorado potato beetle infestation into fields in the spring; and (2) to develop an area-wide Colorado potato beetle pest management program for commercial Wisconsin potato growers. Eighteen field edges in Central Wisconsin were sampled in 1996 to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the deployment of systemic imidacloprid (Admire ® ) on field edges to reduce the movement of Colorado potato beetle adults into fields in spring. Whole field treatments of Admire® were extremely effective in providing season-long Colorado potato beetle control. Admire® -treated trap crop areas protected treated edges from defoliation but were not sufficiently toxic to dispersing adults to limit Colorado potato beetle infestations into the main crop area. A geographic area of greater then 45,000 acres of land in southern Portage County, Wisconsin was designated as an experimental area for area-wide pest management of the Colorado potato beetle. During a three year period (1997 to 1999) beetle populations in each potato field within this region (122 fields) were determined by field sampling and mapped using GIS computer systems. The distance between current and previous potato fields in a rotation and the style of beetle management were the primary factors affecting distribution within the area. Long distance rotations of greater than 400 meters were an effective cultural control management strategy to limit adult beetle infestations in the spring. The insecticidal management strategy used also aided in the reduction of Colorado potato beetles leaving fields in the fall and entering fields in the spring. Area-wide Colorado potato beetle management can be an effective resistance management strategy. Alternations of chemical classes in adjacent fields can reduce the selection pressure on the Colorado potato beetle by particular insecticides, thus delaying the onset of resistance.

AB  - Spiders are abundant predatory arthropods of agricultural systems that can help to reduce the abundance of insect pest species. The aim of the thesis was to demonstrate how a variety of agricultural management practices can affect the distribution, dispersal and behaviour of the spider fauna present in brassica crops. The majority of agro-arachnological research has been carried out in cereal crops, in particular winter wheat, with a paucity of research concerning vegetable crops, such as brassicas. The distribution of spiders in brassica crops and crop edges and margins was assessed with the use of pitfall traps. Linyphiidae were homogeneously distributed, whereas cursorial species were more abundant towards the edges of the crop and where there was a higher vegetation density. Changes in species abundance within the crop, and around the field margins, were related to changes in the density of crop and weed vegetation. Early stages of crop development were associated with pioneer, epigeal web builders, e.g. Erigone spp., whereas as the crop matured and the level of weed over increased the number of foliage based web building spiders e.g. Tenuiphantes tenuis (Blackwall, 1852), also increased. The levels of exchange of individuals, over different levels of vegetation, in the crop/margin ecotone were assessed by employing mark-release-recapture trials in simulated field margins. The dispersal of the lycosid species Pardosa amentata was affected to a greater degree than linyphiid species, possibly due to the differences in dispersal capabilities. Changes in the vegetation structure in the margin and the field area significantly influenced the movements of P. amentata (Clerck, 1757), with individuals remaining within the margin when a hard boundary was present, and more individuals moving out of the margin when the structure of the vegetation across the boundary was more similar. Predatory arthropods within the agricultural system may be influenced by the applications of pesticides and so laboratory assays were carried out to determine the sub-lethal impact of cypermethrin on behaviour of P. amentata and T. tenuis. Mortality increased with exposure to the technical grade cypermethrin (P. amentata) and with exposure to high levels of active ingredient (T. tenuis). However, in both species, those individuals that were not killed showed few long term modifications in their feeding, locomotory and web building behaviour. This represents the first work to be carried out on the influence of pesticides on the web building behaviour of a Linyphiidae species, and highlights the lack of current knowledge on the sublethal effects of pesticide applications on the behaviour of most agricultural spiders.

AB  - Water pollution from diffuse sources remains a problem after decades of point-source pollution regulation under the Clean Water Act. To address this, the EPA has recently attempted to regulate municipal stormwater discharges, which deposit pollution collected from diffuse sources on our streets and sidewalks, into water bodies. Unfortunately, this legislation provides no direct source of funding. Phase II of the program, which applies the regulations to small cities, has come into effect just when many municipalities are experiencing budget crises. While full realization of the goals of Phase II cannot be met without a substantial outlay of time and money, cities without such resources can take measures to pave the way for future implementation. This thesis provides an analysis of Phase II implementation in Providence, Rhode Island. A dense city with an industrial history, aging infrastructure, and a tight budge, Providence faces many challenges in creating an effective stormwater program. This thesis explores zoning changes, redevelopment, the infiltrative capacity of existing green space, and creative partnerships as a way for Providence to lay the foundation for a robust stormwater program as outlined by Phase II.

AB  - The objective of this study was to provide analogous information on the flora and fauna margins within grasslands and to develop pro-active measures which would facilitate their enhancement. A randomised split plot, field margin experiment was established in 2002 to investigate the influence of establishment method on botanical diversity. Establishment methods were: (1) fenced only, (2) rotavated and fenced, (3) rotavated, reseeded with a grass and wild flower seed mixture and fenced; and (4) control, which were grazed and fertilised in a similar manner to the remainder of the paddock. These establishment methods were instigated on plots 1.5m, 2.5m and 3.5m in width. Results indicated that reseeding consistently produced the most botanically diverse sward, with fewer 'undesirable' species than were recorded within the rotavated plots. Little change in botanical diversity was recorded within the control and fenced plots over the duration of the trial. An investigation of the potential nutritional value of multispecies grasslands for grazing animals, was undertaken in Chapter four. Flora from each of the four field margin establishment treatments were compared in terms of their dry matter yield and nutrient levels. Results showed that in terms of DM yield, reseeded plots were almost 17% higher than the Lolium perenne dominated control plots. Nutrient content data from species such as Plantago lanceolata, Leucanthemum vulgare, Lotus cornicalatus, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus and Festuca rubra indicated their potential to enhance the nutrient content of the sward. Research focused on the rejuvenation of botanically degraded, long established field margins within Chapter three. Misplaced nutrient inputs such as animal slurries increase fertility levels within field margins to the detriment of the ground flora. Results presented within this chapter demonstrated that floral rejuvenation of these habitants is possible through the exclusion of nutrient sources. The use of 'asulox' for the control of Pteridium aquilinum demonstrated that the judicious use of selective herbicides can be effective means of controlling 'problematic' species, with the minimum level of environmental impact. The necessity of retaining a diversity of habitants on farmland to promote and sustain a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna is demonstrated in Chapters 5 and 6. Within Chapter 5 an investigation into the potential use of the Syrphidae as bioindicators within the landscape is undertaken. A total of 57 syrphid species were recorded at the Longford site, 27 of which were newly recorded within the county. Using the 'Syrph the Net' database we can predict that the continued presence of 25 of these species is only possible through the retention of a diversity of 'non-agriculturally productive' habitants upon this farm. A total of 32 species were recorded at the Wexford site, two of which were newly recorded within the county.

AB  - Agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the major cause of surface water pollution in the U.S.. However, owing to the difficulty of regulating private land use, the predominant strategy by which to deal with this problem, is to rely upon farmers voluntarily adopting such best management practices as riparian buffers. This study evaluates the proposition that the advantages of the watershed approach and riparian buffers can be utilised without requiring radical institutional change or the diminishment of organisation's influence. The term 'bioregional management' can be used to describe such an approach. The Connecticut River basin was chosen in order to test this proposition, since the potential for agricultural nonpoint source pollution is very high owing to this region possessing some of the most fertile agricultural land in the U.S. and the catchment transcends a range of regional, State and local boundaries. Various surrogate indicators from current programs and documents were used in order to test whether bioregional management was occurring. In addition, interviews and questionnaires were used with various 'key actors' from all three levels (federal, State and local) of the U.S. federal political system. This study found that bioregional management is occurring within the Connecticut River basin at all levels (and in some instances, there was even intra-level co-operation, which provided the lead for national initiatives). The State level proved to be the most reluctant to integrate and provided the biggest obstacle to regional co-operation. Agricultural nonpoint source pollution continues to be a problem in the Connecticut River basin despite the development of bioregional management. This is due to the failure of programs (both State and federal) to provide suitable incentives for farmers to install riparian buffers and other related actions.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are known for their high diversity, yet they represent one of the most threatened habitats globally. I studied riparian and upland bird communities in undisturbed old-growth forest on western Vancouver Island, B.C. and in riparian buffer strips retained after harvesting. In undisturbed forest, species richness and diversity did not differ over the riparian-upland gradient. Except for riparian specialists and species associated with deciduous vegetation, there was broad overlap of species and abundances between riparian and upland habitats. To test if fragmentation of riparian habitats alters bird communities, I surveyed birds in buffers of varying widths 5-7 years post-harvest. Effects of fragmentation on species richness and overall abundance were weak to absent in these communities, which are dominated by several forest generalists. The few forest-interior species were less abundant in all but the widest buffers and were replaced by open-edge species in narrower buffers. Species assemblages in narrow buffers were also least similar to controls. Species richness and abundance increased in both buffers and adjacent clearcuts during the study period. Because populations able to use the forest matrix may persist better in buffers, I studied movements of birds across river and forest-clearcut edges. Forest generalists, open-edge and ubiquitous species crossed riparian and clearcut edges most often. Movements were more frequent across clearcut edges than river edges and were positively related to densities in buffers rather than to buffer width. Movements were highest in narrow buffers, however, suggesting that birds move in and out of narrow buffers because they do not provide suitable habitat to support forest-dwelling species. I suggest that narrow buffers function as foraging sites or travel corridors. Finally, I examined patterns of vegetation across varying buffer widths to test if habitat diversity better explains patterns of bird species richness and abundance than buffer width. Densities of faster-growing deciduous trees, and richness and cover of shrubs and forbs differed over the range of buffer widths. While species richness and abundances of several bird guilds and species were explained better by buffer width, three habitat specialist guilds: riparian specialists, forest interior and open-edge species and 4 of 8 individual species were best predicted by density and cover of deciduous vegetation. Deciduous vegetation was more common in wider buffers providing further evidence that retaining wide buffers enhances bird habitat.

AB  - This dissertation investigates theoretical and empirical links between soil conservation and risk. On a theoretical level I demonstrate how price uncertainty and consumption risk reduce the incentives for investment in soil conserving crops and technologies. On an empirical level I show that investment patterns among poor upland farmers can be best explained by the consumption risks embodied in various soil conservation strategies, and the capacity of households to manage these risks. The risk characteristics of soil conservation strategies present a significant barrier to soil conservation investments for many upland households. To test the hypothesis that investment behavior is conditioned on consumption risk and capacity to manage it, I examine the benefits and costs of soil conservation for producers at two upland sites in the Philippines. I use a series of econometric and stochastic dynamic programming models that incorporate risk to explain why some farmers at these sites show reluctance to invest in soil conservation, whilst others find it advantageous to invest. Compared with a model that assumes certainty and risk neutrality, models implemented under assumptions of uncertainty and risk aversion, especially downside-risk aversion, consistently generate patterns of resource allocation closer to those observed at the study sites. The major analytical contribution of the study is a model of soil conservation investment that combines a sunk-cost investment decision under uncertainty with a dynamic portfolio allocation problem. The dissertation applies recent theoretical contributions from the general literature on investment under uncertainty to the issue of soil conservation in a low-income setting. Data from two 1994 farm surveys are used to estimate parametric and non-parametric econometric models of conservation adoption, as well as heteroskedastic yield functions for corn grown using traditional methods and contour hedgerows for soil conservation. The empirical findings in support of risk-conditioned investment behavior and crop choice have important policy implications for promotion of soil conservation in developing countries, as well as implications for general equilibrium models that seek to predict the environmental impacts of economic change. The study concludes with a policy simulation of partial market liberalization and its likely impact on rates of upland erosion.

AB  - The main objective of the present dissertation is to investigate past and recent forest-atmosphere interactions across biomes. A review of the literature and analyses of available databases show that in extratropical zones forest expansion was the dominant response to climate warming during the early to mid-Holocene (12,000-4,000 YBP). Tropical forests started to expand after this period, possibly in response to wetter conditions. Recent changes in the atmosphere are expected to promote forest expansion worldwide, but the effect of this process on global climate remains unknown. As a result of extensive palynological studies, forest expansion in temperate and boreal regions is well understood, but in the tropics alternative techniques are needed to elucidate mechanisms of expansion. Using soil organic matter isotope composition I show that after millennia of stability forest borders and patches have continuously expanded into grasslands in southern Brazil. Soil-plant feedbacks appear to be involved in this process, as colonizing trees increase soil fertility and microbial activity, promoting the establishment of other tree species. Nevertheless, expansion in this region has been orders of magnitude slower than historically observed in temperate and boreal regions, which could possibly be explained by competition, dispersal limitations and disturbances. Dendrochronological and isotopic analyses reveal that the colonizing tree Araucaria angustifolia has been affected by recent atmospheric changes. Systemic increases in water use efficiency occurred in response to rising atmospheric CO2 , but warming-induced stress has caused tree growth decline. Similar results are observed for two deciduous (Quercus rubra and Acer rubrum ) and two conifer (Picea mariana and Pinus resinosa ) species in temperate and boreal forests of Canada. Despite increases in water use efficiency over the past century, tree growth decline has been the prevalent response. Basal are increment has been negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with precipitation, suggesting warming-induced water stress. Relationships between water use efficiency and basal area increment through time can be used to anticipate the effects of atmospheric changes on forests worldwide. Dendrochronological and isotopic measurements can be used with this purpose, but future studies should account for intrinsic autocorrelations between water use efficiency and atmospheric CO 2 levels.

AB  - The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), has been a significant pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains since the inception of small grain production by homesteading farmers. Biological constraints associated with both the larval and adult stages of the sawfly have thwarted the development of effective chemical control of this stem-boring pest. To date, management of sawfly relies on cultural and ecologically-based strategies. Foremost among these was the development of sawfly-resistant wheat varieties. Sawfly damage is estimated to have reduced profits to Montana wheat producers by $20.4 million during the 1995-1996 growing season. Many Montana spring wheat fields are also impacted by the grassy weed wild oat, Avena fatua L. (Poeaceae: Gramineae). Reduced yield, grain dockage and herbicide treatment costs are the primary sources of economic loss due to wild oat infestation of wheat fields and cost Montana farmers approximately $20 million annually. An accurate characterization of the spatial pattern and distribution of adult and larval stages of sawfly in sawfly-resistant spring wheat was developed to enhance existing management tools. Contrary to the conventionally held perception that sawfly is an edge-effect pest, sawfly infestation was not found to be predominantly focused at field margins. The influence of wild oat on sawfly spatial distribution was also examined. Although sawfly larval mortality was 100% in all infested wild oat stems examined, sawfly acceptance of this host plant was not rare. However, sawfly host plant preference was significantly higher for spring wheat than for wild oat hosts based on the relative densities of each species. Sawfly attack on the small number of spring wheat stems within wild oat patches at a higher rate than spring wheat in weed-free areas further emphasizes sawfly host plant preference for spring wheat.

AB  - This study was conducted to improve understanding and prediction of sediment delivery through agricultural watersheds, with emphasis on the pathways from edge-of-field to receiving waters. The study was focused on agricultural watersheds within the University of Wisconsin (UW) - Platteville Pioneer Farm and one of the UW Discovery Farms located in southwestern Wisconsin. Artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict runoff and sediment yield from agricultural watersheds that employ best management practices (BMPs). Results showed that input parameters representing BMPs were important for accurately simulating runoff and sediment yield from these watersheds. The study also showed that ANN models were able to successfully simulate runoff and sediment yield during training, validation and testing phases. Sediment eroded from upland source areas is often carried to the watershed outlet via grassed waterways. Critical shear stress of the soil is often estimated to determine the potential for soil to be detached. Previous studies suggest that critical shear stress may vary with antecedent moisture content. The dynamic nature of critical shear stress in an upland agricultural field and grassed waterway of a nested watershed was investigated at Pioneer Farm by measuring critical shear stress over a range of antecedent soil moisture conditions. Results showed that critical shear stress in both the grassed waterway and the agricultural field increased as soil moisture increased until the soil moisture content reached the plastic limit. Above the plastic limit, critical shear stress of the soil decreased significantly and was relatively constant, ultimately rendering the soil more susceptible to erosion. Finally, the process-based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was used to develop regressions equations that use channel, watershed and storm characteristics to estimate sediment delivery ratios (SDRs) for grassed waterways draining upland agricultural fields. Upland agricultural management scenarios considered included: (i) corn-oat-alfalfa crop rotation, chisel plow tillage, and terraces, and (ii) corn-oat-alfalfa crop rotation, chisel plow tillage, and no-terraces. Better R 2 values resulted from equations developed for non-terraced fields compared to terraced fields suggested that channel and storm parameters were better able to explain the variation in SDR for grassed waterways draining from non-terraced fields.

AB  - Rice stink bug (RSB), Oebalus pugnax F., is an important pest of heading rice in the United States. RSB feeding induced volatile production in different RSB host grasses and rice varieties and may help explain RSB movement to heading rice. Limonene and MeSA were found in varying amounts from panicles of host grasses and rice. RSB feeding induced caryophyllene production from panicles of only rice and vaseygrass. Limonene was produced in higher amounts in the RSB resistant rice cultivar 'Kaybonnet' than in more susceptible 'Cocodrie' and `Bengal'. Sweep net samples of grassy margins around rice fields that had a more diverse vegetation habitat that included RSB host grasses also had significantly higher sweep net counts of RSB. I discuss the need to assess effects of limonene and methyl salicylate on development of RSB, note levels of these volatiles in rice varieties and better manage RSB in wheat fields and other grass hosts near rice fields. Keywords . votatiles, sweeping, limonene, habitat.

AB  - The overall objective of this study was to evaluate biomass production and soil ameliorative potential of alley farming in sub-humid India. Effect of the cutting height (40, 80, 120, 160 cm) of Leucaena hedges and root barriers on biomass yield of Leucaena and maize and wheat crops were examined. Trees were pruned at sowing of crops and pruned biomass recycled as surface mulch at the rate of 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ twice every year. Biomass production from the trees increased with increasing cutting height up to 120 cm without any substantial reduction in the crop yields. Root barriers had little effect on trees, no effect on maize, but significantly increased wheat grain and straw yield near the trees indicating competitive below ground interaction between Leucaena and wheat. Some alteration in pruning timing may help to minimize tree-crop competition. Crop yields sharply increased with increasing mulch levels when compared on a net-cropped-area basis. However, growing of higher levels of mulch material rapidly reduced area under crops. When adjusted for loss in crop area, a reduction in the grain production was estimated with increasing mulch levels. Estimates based on tree-crop interactions observed in this study show that an alley cropping system with 20% area under Leucaena hedge-rows would provide about 12% lower grain yield and 15% higher fodder yield from crops compared to sole cropping system. In addition, trees would provide about 3.2 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ fuel wood. In such an arrangement, about 3 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$yr$\sp{-1}$ mulch can be recycled which will have little soil ameliorative value as it showed only marginal increase in soil organic matter (SOM). The system should, however, maintain current yield levels. I used a simulation model SCUAF (Soil Changes Under Agro-Forestry) for predicting expected changes in SOM under different mulch levels. The predicted changes in SOM after a period of 25 years were of the same magnitude as observed changes in soil microbial biomass (Bc) during the 3 year study. Results of this study support the hypotheses that the Bc:Oc ratio tends to return to a climate induced equilibria and early changes in Bc may be used for providing quantitative projections of changes in SOM under different land management options. However, this relationship needs to be validated with long-term field data.

AB  - Pesticide and nutrient runoff from agricultural fields is a socio-environmental problem in the Midwest. Riparian forest buffers are proven to perform several important ecosystem functions that improve local and regional water quality problems by minimizing the negative effects of agricultural runoff. However, adoption rates of riparian forest buffers are low in Nebraska. This project compared the characteristics of a sample of adopters and nonadopters of riparian forest buffers in two southeastern Nebraska watersheds, and a sample of adopters who participated in the Nebraska forest buffer program. Data were collected using survey methods (n = 594), follow-up phone interviews with adopters (n = 12), and on-site field visits (n = 6). Data were gathered on willingness to use riparian forest buffers, factors affecting their use, and adopter decision-making. Several key respondent characteristics were determined that could be used to identify potential adopters. Producers who were less specialized, farmed less than 400 hectares, lived near the site where a RFB could be established, and were willing to participate in government programs were more likely to adopt RFBs. Similarly, nonproducers who were younger, lived near the site where a RFB could be established, and did not have negative perceptions about government payment programs were more likely to adopt RFBs. There were several important findings from this study. First, adopters of riparian forest buffers were equally as likely to be a producer as a nonproducer. Second, almost half of the producers (43.5%) and nonproducers (44.7%) surveyed were willing to participate in a government payment program to establish a RFB. Third, key predictors of adoption included: positive attitudes toward government payment programs to install RFBs; perceptions that water quality was affected by farming to the edge of a stream; and, perceptions that RFBs impacted water quality and soil erosion positively.

AB  - Nitrate (NO3 ) enrichment of the shallow aquifer represents a potentially significant water quality problem in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Ultimately, discharge of nitrate-enriched groundwater into surface waters may stimulate eutrophication of N-limited coastal waters or proliferation of parasitic microorganisms. Riparian buffers, vegetated streamside zones uncultivated due to relief or high water table, have demonstrated a clear ability to remove nitrate from the shallow groundwater. Perhaps the most significant mechanism expediting this loss of nitrate from the groundwater is denitrification, the microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N 2 ). This research was conducted to determine nitrate depletion below a swine lagoon effluent-irrigated Coastal Bermuda grass pasture ( Cynodon dactylon ) and adjacent riparian zone, and denitrification activity in the riparian zone above and below flow-control structures. Shallow groundwater monitoring wells (1-5 m below surface) indicated that although substantial nitrate losses may have occurred in flatter bottomland pastures and riparian zones, nitrate depletion was limited in many pasture and riparian zones. Significant increases in nitrate concentrations in low order receiving streams suggested that the riparian buffers were not capable of depleting all of the nitrate from the shallow groundwater. Denitrification activity was substantial (> 1,200 kg N ha -1 yr-1 ) in perennially saturated areas, and significantly higher above flow-control structures installed in lower-grade stream channels (p < 0.01). Because nitrate and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were optimum for denitrifiers in most areas, soil moisture was the most important factor in determining the magnitude of denitrification losses.

AB  - Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites. Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats. Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors. At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken. A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted. The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species. Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate. A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands. This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species. No effect was observed at derelict sites. However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat. Derelict and wetland assemblages were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance. The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors. The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists. These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation. Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.

AB  - Forests are the origin for 80% of the fresh water utilized in the United States. Timber harvesting has been widely blamed for the degradation of such water stores. In order to reduce the potential for such adverse effects, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) developed a best management practice that leaves a riparian buffer next to streams to reduce the possibility of water quality degradation. The purpose of this study is to quantify water quality in upland forested watersheds before harvesting commences in order to provide a baseline for comparison with post-harvest water quality analyses. Water monitoring occurred on 15 sites in and around Current River and Angeline Conservation Areas in Missouri, USA. Water samples were collected from in-stream water samplers located in the ephemeral drainage way and (2) hillslope samplers located on slopes adjoining the ephemeral drainage way. The water samples were tested for total phosphorous, soluble reactive phosphorous, total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonia, calcium, magnesium, potassium, total suspended solids, total volatile suspended solids, pH, and electrical conductivity. The time period of sample collection began in October 2004 and lasted to January 2006. This time period yielded nearly 384 samples. The baseline levels for all constituents have been quantitatively determined by utilizing the "three sigma method" which incorporates data from 99.87% of all values recorded for the species of interest. The following baseline values were established: pH was 8.3, electrical conductivity was 200 us/cm, TSS was 0.5 g/L and TVSS was 0.2 g/L, Ca was 13 mg/L and Mg was 10 mg/L, K was 10 mg/L, TP was 1.3 mg/L and SRP was 1.1 mg/L, total nitrogen was 5.8 mg/L and nitrate and ammonia concentrations were 1.3 and 1.6 mg/L respectively. All parameter concentrations were found to have strong seasonal trends, and varied greatly from site to site.

AB  - This thesis assesses the biodiversity, conservation and functional value for soil macrofauna of one commonly implemented option - arable field margins. Soil macrofauna are involved in several important ecosystem services, including organic matter decomposition and pest control, but are under-represented in most studies of farmland biodiversity. This thesis presents four studies addressing this knowledge deficit. The first study assessed the relative efficiency of three commonly used extraction methods (handsorting, Winkler bags and Tullgren funnels) for sampling macrofauna in agroecosystems and identified handsorting as the most appropriate method. The second study investigated the effect of arable field margins on the alpha and beta diversity of soil macrofauna in a Berkshire (UK) farm, and demonstrated that margins have conservation, biodiversity and functional values for soil macrofauna. Higher species densities and abundances were recorded in grass margins than in field edges without margins. Comparisons of macrofaunal assemblages of margins with other cultivated and semi-natural habitats within the farm showed that margins also contribute to increasing beta diversity or species turnover. The third study investigated the effect of margin composition and management on soil macrofauna. The seed mix used to establish margins was found to have no effect on soil macrofauna but management by soil disturbance (c.f. cutting or selective herbicide application) reduced the abundance and species densities of soil macrofauna. The final study assessed the impact of margin management on litter decomposition - an ecosystem service mediated by soil macrofauna. Soil disturbance facilitated faster rates of litter loss background compared to aboveground. Based on these conclusions, I recommend improvements to current agri-environment scheme options.

AB  - Despite being one of the most intensively studied game-birds in North America, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus ) populations have been declining at 3.0%/year since 1966. Habitat loss/degradation from agricultural intensification has been identified as one probable cause for this decline. Farmland conservation practices encouraged under several Farm Bill programs offer opportunities to enhance northern bobwhite habitat. I examined the value of one conservation practice (field borders) for northern bobwhite and overwintering grassland birds. During the winter, 2000, I established experimental field borders (6.1 m wide) along agriculture related field edges of row crop fields on one half of each of 3 conventional row crop agriculture farms in northeast Mississippi, leaving the remaining half of each farm to serve as a control landscape. I measured breeding season and fall covey abundance, survival, and habitat use of northern bobwhites during 1999-2002. I evaluated use of human imprinted, ligatured, pen-strain northern bobwhite chicks to assess arthropod availability and then used this technique to measure relative arthropod availability between field border and adjacent row crop habitats. I developed predictive models of northern bobwhite space-use from habitat-use patterns of radiomarked birds. Pen-strain chicks exhibited greater growth rates than wild-strain chicks, however, pen-strain chicks consumed similar sized arthropods in similar quantities to wild-strain chicks. Ligatured chicks retained arthropods in the crop whereas nearly 33% of the arthropod biomass consumed by non-ligatured chicks passed to the gizzard. Although conservation field borders may supply abundant arthropods for chicks in some landscapes, early successional (<3 years old) field borders in my study did not provide more arthropods than row crops fields. Northern bobwhite survival did not differ between bordered and non-bordered landscapes during the 3 years of study. Observed effect sizes (23.3-65.8%) in abundance indices suggest that field borders may enhance northern bobwhite abundance, but given the magnitude of variation of the estimates and the relatively small number of replicate landscapes in my study, these differences were not detectable statistically. To elicit measurable responses from northern bobwhite populations, I suggest that at least 5-10% of a site be placed in field border habitats.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes a small yet important part of a watershed's carbon budget. While DOC generally comprises less than 1% of the overall carbon budget, it is important because it is the most mobile and biologically reactive form of carbon. The primary vegetation present within a watershed, rainfall intensity, and duration of storm events may impact the concentration of DOC in runoff water and the amount of DOC exported from watersheds. Agricultural practices which promote carbon sequestration may also influence DOC concentrations and load in surface runoff, consequently impacting stream ecosystem processes. In a long-term experiment at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Jasper County, Iowa, USA, selected native vegetation perennial cover treatments were randomly assigned to twelve small agricultural watersheds in a balanced incomplete block design. Treatments applied to the watersheds consist of native perennial vegetation (NPV) strips varying in location and percentage of the total area within each agricultural watershed. One of four treatments was randomly assigned to each watershed. Three watersheds were planted in 100% row-crops, three with 10% NPV only in the footslope position, three with 10% of their area in NPV divided into two strips; one on the hillslope and one in the footslope position, and three watersheds with 20% in NPV with strips on the hillslope and footslope positions. Two additional watersheds planted in 100% NPV located in the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge were also monitored but are not part of the balanced incomplete block design. Samples from 2008-2010 were analyzed for DOC concentrations and correlated with flow data to determine flow weighted DOC concentrations and total flux per watershed. All three years of the study experienced higher than normal precipitation. From analysis over the full three year study, for flow weighted DOC concentrations, treatment was significant (p = 0.09) only between 10% NPV at the footslope and 20% NPV in contours watersheds. During an extreme storm event August 8-11, 2010, flow weighted DOC concentrations from the 100% agricultural watersheds was significantly higher than from all of the NPV treatment watersheds (p = 0.008). Watersheds planted in 100% agriculture exported greater DOC loads than from the 10% NPV at footslope watersheds over the three year study (p = 0.04) and during the storm event August 8-11, 2010 (p = 0.07). Results from this study show that of the four treatments, the conversion of 10% of an agricultural watershed's area into NPV in the footslope position significantly increased DOC concentrations but decreased export when compared to 100% agricultural watersheds. Results indicate that the incorporation of NPV as buffer strips may be a valuable land management tool to reduce DOC loading to levels exported from tallgrass prairie watersheds.

AB  - To maximize the multiple benefits and minimize the environmental costs from agricultural lands, farmers and policy makers need a better understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem function in organic farming systems. Organic farming, which does not use synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, is thought to improve environmental quality, relatively little research has occurred to better manage for this outcome. To develop management strategies that provide multiple ecosystem services (e.g., food and fiber production, water and soil quality, and pest management) in agricultural landscapes, research approaches require a better understanding of ecological processes. Specifically, current ecological theory about the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions suggests that managing for biodiverse landscapes could improve both agricultural production and environmental quality. This dissertation consists of three studies that investigate management practices on two large-scale organic farms. The first study analyzes crop, soil, pest and management changes during the organic transition period on two ranches (40 and 47 ha) in the Salinas Valley, California, in cooperation with a large conventional vegetable producer. It showed a successful transition, using many crop taxa, diverse types of inputs for soil fertility, drip irrigation, and careful attention to weed management. The second study evaluated management practices (e.g. tailwater ponds and cover crops), and demonstrated that decreased sediment, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and reactive phosphorus were achieved, thus improving water quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both the second and third studies took place on an organic processing tomato farm (44 ha) in the Sacramento Valley, California. The third study assessed the biodiversity and ecosystem function of the entire farmscape by inventorying and monitoring six habitats in and around the processing tomato fields for plant, nematode, and microbial (Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis) communities, and related soil properties. Results from these studies indicate that biodiversity-based management strategies (e.g., small diverse plantings, crop rotations, and woody perennials on farm margins) are effective at maintaining yields, structuring soil communities of microbes and nematodes, and contributing to environmental quality. Additionally, management of non-production areas (farm edges) and non-production periods can ensure greater biodiversity and overall ecosystem function of the farmscape.

AB  - This dissertation investigates the economic viability of snow management in the Northern Great Plains. Snow management as studied here entails the use of vegetative barriers to capture snow on wheatfields in the Northern Great Plains. Additional water from the snow melt holds the potential for increasing the productivity of those fields. The economic analysis is made from a farmer/decision maker's standpoint. Data for the analysis comes from seven North Dakota counties and seven South Dakota counties. The analysis uses both regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Regression analysis is used to estimate yield models for each county, for spring wheat and winter wheat, both for continuous cropping and for fallow cropping. The second phase uses the yield models as a base to estimate distributions for net revenues in each county for cropping with and without snow management. Monte Carlo programming is then used to simulate the outcomes (net revenues) that would result from a farmer adapting snow management, and these are compared to farming using the traditional techniques. The yield models showed that the use of snow management can result in excessive water in the spring and a decrease in yields. These results occurred in counties where spring precipitation was the greatest--usually in the Eastern area of the Great Plains. This result can be somewhat offset by farmers who have the flexibility to switch from spring to winter wheat--an option not allowed by the model. The Monte Carlo simulation of county-level net returns from snow management had inconsistent results. These were partially due to the highly sensitive nature of the yield models, and partially due to the different climatic conditions in each county. Overall, the model showed that snow management can often be used as a tool to increase net returns; however, the risk associated with those returns also increases. In other situations it was shown superior to some current farming techniques and inferior to others. The areas where snow management showed the greatest promise of economic viability were areas which had relatively low spring precipitation--primarily the western extremes of the plains--and the ability to switch to winter wheat from spring wheat and from crop fallow to continuous cropping techniques.

AB  - In this dissertation, I quantified uptake and transformation of nitrate (NO3- ) in small (≤third-order) streams and related these dynamics to aquatic ecosystem processes, including primary production and organic matter decomposition, and attributes of riparian zone structure and vegetation composition. I also analyze patterns of stream NO 3 - processing among three classes of adjacent land use practices (forest, agriculture, and urban). In Chapter 2, ambient rates of NO3- uptake and transformation were measured with 24-hr releases of 15 N-labeled NO3- in nine stream reaches in the Willamette River Basin of western Oregon during summer low flow (July-August). Denitrification, dissimilatory reduction of NO3- to N2 and N2 O gases, composed 3-15% of 15 N budgets over 500 m in two agricultural reaches and in one urban reach dominated by large slowly-turning over pools. However, denitrification was below detection limit at five of the remaining six reaches. This study showed that pathways of stream NO3- uptake and transformation differed among streams adjacent to three diverse land use practices. In Chapter 3, I quantified effects of substrate nutritional quality and inorganic N loading (as NO3- ) on wood breakdown in western Oregon streams. Results suggest that increases in N loading to streams bordered by riparian forests with fast-growing deciduous species could increase wood breakdown rates. On the other hand, increases to N loading may have a smaller effect on wood breakdown in streams surrounded by long-lived coniferous species. In Chapter 4, I quantified patterns of stream channel and riparian zone attributes for 72 streams equally distributed among forests or grasslands, agriculture, and urban land use practices on from eight major North American regions. I also related these patterns to stream NO 3- uptake determined from 15 NO3- tracer releases. Agricultural and urban streams had a simplified channel structure (low width-to-depth ratio, low variation in stream depth, and high stream banks) relative to forest or grassland streams. A multiple regression model showed that stream NO3- uptake decreased with increasing canopy cover, but also increased with abundance of silt in benthic sediments. This suggested NO3- uptake was strongly influenced by in-stream primary production and extent of anoxic environments (conducive for denitrification). A multiple regression model for fractional NO3 - uptake by denitrification further supported the concept that extent of anoxic environments influenced overall NO3 - uptake in streams. Through these studies, I demonstrated that attributes of riparian zone structure and vegetation composition can strongly influence NO3 - uptake and transformation in stream ecosystems by controlling organic matter dynamics. I also have shown that riparian zone attributes vary significantly among three different land use types (forest or grassland, agriculture, and urban). Similarly, pathways of NO 3- uptake and effects of NO3- on wood breakdown did or were expected to differ among different land use types/riparian zone characteristics. However, other factors besides riparian attributes, particularly level of nutrient loading, alteration of stream channel physical structure, and basin position of the stream, must be considered in concert when evaluating effects of land use on riparian zone and stream ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones (RBZ's) are critical for protecting water quality both in channel and downstream. High Resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides a way to locate where water is flowing through a channel into an RBZ and then into a stream. The objectives of this study were to characterize riparian buffer zones around Lake Issaqueena, SC and streams flowing into the lake by channel presence: ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial; to relate channel presence to buffer width and buffer cover composition via soil moisture content and buffer width, and to validate potential differences in LiDAR versus field observations via soil moisture content and soil temperature. A LiDAR derived DEM was utilized in ArcGIS to define flow channels and determine forty locations for field measurements (soil moisture, buffer width, buffer composition, and a thermal image of the soil) around Lake Issaqueena. LiDAR indicated channels were ephemeral with large buffers generally ten meters or greater (except where locations were located on private property). High flow accumulation channels can be accurately predicted by LiDAR data, but not for low and moderate flow channels. Surface soil temperature measurements were relatively uniform with some extremes and showed no difference between sample locations and control locations indicating that channel presence cannot be accurately predicted using surface soil temperature. These presented methodologies can serve as a template for future efforts to quantify riparian buffers and their effects on protecting in-stream habitat and water quality.

AB  - An integrative modeling approach (IMA) is developed to generate a trade off curve between agricultural production and ecosystem services at a farm level. The methodology involves integrating a evolutionary algorithm with a hydrologic model AGNPS, a composite wildlife index model, and an economic model. The methodology developed in this research will help to identify the shape (competitive, complementary or supplementary) of the PPF curve of economic returns and ecosystem services. The integrated model is capable of identifying the optimal combinations of agricultural production and ecosystem services based on the available technology and resources at a farm level. In this study a multi agent based model using evolutionary algorithms is been developed and utilized to identify the current performance level of farms based on existing policy and market conditions. This study captures various ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes with riparian buffers such as increased water quality and wildlife benefits. The integration of IMA and multi agent based model helps one to identify the trade offs in gross margin that is required to provide more ecosystem services at a farm level. This integration also helps to identify the possible improvement with respect to economic gain and ecosystem service production for each farm from the current level of production. The study is conducted on a subset of the Cache river watershed called the Big creek watershed. This comprehensive integrated modeling framework has important policy implications for the design of conservation stewardship programs such as the CRP, Conservation Security Program (CSP) and National Conservation Buffer Initiative (NCBI), which help target areas such as riparian buffers or land parcels that provide the maximum environmental benefits for the dollar spent. The anticipated results could serve as a tool in decision-making. This research offers interactive and spatially explicit models that will provide scientific information to policy makers and stakeholders that will aid in their planning and decision-making process regarding landuse decisions and their impacts on ecosystem services from various policy scenarios and market conditions.

AB  - This dissertation explores the timing, magnitude, and pattern of thermal pollution for streams within urban heat islands, with the goal of understanding what aspects of watershed development most strongly influence the thermal regimes of streams. In Chapter 2, I explore the differences in baseflow and stormflow temperatures in 60 watersheds across the North Carolina Piedmont that ranged across a gradient of urbanization. I asked: 1) How do maximum temperatures at baseflow and maximum temperature surges at stormflow differ across watersheds with varying development intensity? 2) What reach- and watershed-scale variables are most correlated with these 2 aspects of stream thermal regimes? 3) Do stream management approaches (riparian buffers, channel restoration) address the links between these variables and stream temperature? Next, in Chapter 3, I explore longitudinal temperature patterns in a single stream, Mud Creek, in Durham, North Carolina. Mud Creek's headwaters are suburban, and the stream travels through a number of housing developments before entering a 100-year-old forest. I placed 62 temperature loggers over a 1.5 km reach of this stream. To explore the mechanisms by which stormflow heat pulses dissipate along this stream reach, I asked: 1) What is the range of heat pulse magnitudes that occur over a year? 2) What is the maximum distance that a heat pulse travels downstream of urban inputs? 3) How do the magnitude and distance vary with storm characteristics, including antecedent air temperature and amount and intensity of precipitation? In Chapter 4, I examine which aspects about development best explain thermal differences observed at baseflow and stormflow. To do this, I selected 15 similarly sized watersheds in the North Carolina Piedmont region within 45 to 55% development that varied in other development characteristics, specifically density of stormwater infrastructure and aggregation of development patches. I asked two questions: 1) How does the configuration and connectivity of development within a watershed influence baseflow and stormflow temperatures in receiving streams? 2) How do baseflow and stormflow temperatures vary with development characteristics? Thermal pollution in urban streams is a problem that will only be exacerbated by predicted climate change and urban expansion. These findings imply that thermal pollution is a problem throughout urban landscapes, even far downstream of urban inputs and within protected areas, and must be managed as an important component of the USS. Future research should focus on the transferability of these findings to regions outside of the southeastern United States and to the movement of other urban pollutants, and on exploring the potential to manage these systems by decreasing sub-surface connectivity.

AB  - Water resource management is an integral part of any sustainable development scenario. It plays a critical role, both in environmental issues and development issues, but most of the time, development and environment have not been looked at in an integral way. It is suggested in this research, that watershed management, which involves managing land use, water resources, human activities, within a management unit of a watershed, is an important tool for sustainable development involving environmental and development issues and can be used effectively to develop policies for sustainable development in a holistic way. In this research, a framework has been built, wherein it is shown how technology like hydrological/water quality models can be used effectively within the limits of a watershed to develop policies for land use and water resources so as to lead to sustainable development. This research is an effort to further the ongoing discourse on sustainable development. Various existing concepts in the literature have been applied to develop this framework. In this framework, watershed sustainability has been defined. It is then quantified by defining social, environmental and biodiversity indicators. By providing weightage to these indicators, a watershed index is built. The watershed sustainability is then calculated based on the concepts of reliability, resilience and vulnerability. To implement this framework, the watershed for the case study has been selected from the southern Delaware region of the US. The watershed used is Millsboro Pond watershed, which is a part of the Inland Bays basin. Based on the watershed management principles, four land use scenarios have been created in GIS. The first scenario used is the existing land use. The second scenario has been based on the recharge potential of the watershed and the third and fourth scenarios have been built by also considering riparian buffer zones along with recharge potential. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used as a hydrology/ water quality model. The Millsboro Pond watershed is first modeled by using SWAT. This included calibrating and validating the model. The existing land use layer in the model is then replaced by the different scenarios of land uses and the model run for 50 years in future. The output from the SWAT is used to calculate watershed indicators and a watershed sustainability index for all the land use scenarios. Based on the results the land uses have been ranked for sustainability and policy implications have been discussed. The output from the model has also been used to suggest supply side and demand side management for the watershed.

AB  - There has been a case of severe gully erosion during the establishment of pine plantations in recent years in southeast NSW. The aim of this thesis is to address the causes of gully initiation, the trends and rates of gully development. More specifically, it aims at finding out the dominant hydrological and erosional processes in gully development. In order to find the causes of massive gully initiation, rainfall, soil properties and topography were compared in the sites with massive gully erosion (1988) and those with minor gully erosion (pine plantations 1986 and 1987). Field measurements and aerial photographs were used to find the trend of gully development and erosion rates. One typical gully was selected to monitor rainfall, overland flow, seepage, water table fluctuation, headcut and bank erosion and sediment deposition in detail. In sum, as revealed in the results, an association of intense storm and disturbance caused severe gully erosion in pine plantations in 1988. Little erosion in older plantations shows that the risk of erosion is low in the case of lack of rainfall in the first year of disturbance. Gully development has an exponential trend with reaction time less than one year. Sediment yield varies between 297 to 1671 m$\sp3$ km $\sp{-2}$ yr$\sp{-1}.$ The higher sediment yield is explained by deep ripper ploughing of the forest. Most of the eroded sediment is trapped at gentle footslopes. Daily rainfall of $>$30mm with a 20 minutes intensity of $>$24 mm/hr produces significant seepage, overland flow and gully erosion. Seepage is a dominant hydrological process at the headcut but bank erosion is caused by a combination of seepage, overland flow and rainsplash. It is indicated that any disturbance increases the risk of erosion, especially in the case of intense rainfall. The main factor controlling gully erosion is soil disturbance and vegetation cover degradation. Most of the erosion happened in early years of gully initiation and was too quick to stop. Sediment could be trapped by designing buffer strips of Eucalyptus. In catchments without gentle footslopes, the buffer zones are more important and their length should be increased around the stream to trap sediment. To infer processes of gully development adequately, both morphology and process studies are necessary.

AB  - In order to preserve valuable riparian functioning, forest harvesting in Canada attempts to protect riparian areas through the application of a no-harvest buffer zone around water bodies, and more recently through the emulation of natural disturbance patterns. Partial harvesting with maintenance of understory vegetation may emulate natural disturbance better than clearcut harvesting with conventional intact riparian buffers. With most canopy gaps in the boreal forest being less than 100 m 2 , small-scale canopy gap disturbance plays an important role in boreal forest dynamics. I studied the response of understory vegetation, including tree seedlings and saplings, to gaps created by partial harvesting in riparian buffers to i) assess the response of understory species to small gaps created by partial harvesting, and ii) investigate overstory replacement patterns in harvest gaps. I hypothesized that i) the boreal understory community would exhibit resilience to small-scale canopy disturbance due to leaf morphological plasticity which allows plants to adapt to gap-induced environmental changes, and ii) that tree seedlings/saplings would respond to gaps through increased growth of all seedlings and saplings and increased stem density of shade intolerant species. Research was conducted in three mixedwood dominated watersheds located on the Canadian boreal shield in northern Ontario. Two watersheds were clearcut in the upland with retention of approximately 40 m riparian buffers. Three years prior to this research, partial harvesting within the buffers created canopy gaps ranging in size from 1-400 m 2 . Gaps were classified as small (<20 m2 ), medium (21-99 m2 ) or large (>100 m2 ). Some portions of the buffers were left unharvested. A third watershed with no recent record of disturbance was used as reference riparian forest. Understory species composition, richness, diversity, abundance, and evenness were compared among treatments on two levels: i) transect means of partially harvested buffers containing gaps, unharvested buffers, and reference forests; and ii) gap centred quadrats compared with closed canopy quadrats in partially harvested and unharvested riparian buffer locations. Specific leaf area (leaf area per unit dry weight) and leaf dry matter content (leaf dry weight as a percentage of fresh weight) of four common understory species ( Clintonia borealis, Cornus canadensis, Vaccinium angustifolium, and Vaccinium myrtilloides ) were assessed in the centre of harvest gaps and along transects of unharvested stands. Stem density, basal diameter, and height of tree seedlings and saplings were compared among gaps, unharvested buffer and reference forest transects. Overstory structure was also tested to determine its influence on tree regeneration. The hypothesis of understory resilience to small-scale canopy disturbance was supported. Understory species composition in terms of richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness did not differ significantly among partially harvested buffers, unharvested buffers, and reference forest. Clintonia borealis, Cornus canadensis, V. angustifolium, and V. myrtilloides, showed differences in specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content under closed canopy and in harvest gaps; supporting the hypothesis that boreal understory species use plasticity of leaf morphology to adapt to slight environmental changes. Consistent with my hypotheses, conifer seedlings/saplings were found in higher abundance under closed canopy than in gaps, but achieved larger sizes in gaps than under closed canopy. In larger gaps the proportion of hardwood regeneration was increased compared to conifers; with Populus tremuloides stem density and size positively correlated with gap area and overstory Populus tremuloides stem density. My results provide evidence that boreal understory species use morphological plasticity of leaves to confer resilience against small gap disturbance. However, partial harvesting can influence future overstory composition by enhanced growth o early successional canopy species such as Populus tremuloides .

AB  - Urban land development is one of the principal means through which human activities alter water resources. An extensive body of research links land use to water quality outcomes, but these studies often do not account for how human behavior and institutional action shape urban land development. This gap in the planning scholarship offers an opportunity to examine the land development process and the policies aimed at protecting water quality. Comprehensive plans, development management ordinances, and approved development applications help organize the land use development process. The translation of a plan and ordinances into action to protect water resources, however, cannot be assumed. This dissertation examines 1) the quality of policy inputs (i.e., comprehensive plans and ordinances); 2) the influence of mandates on the quality of policy inputs; and 3) the implementation of one key best management practice to protect water quality--riparian buffers. The study focused on two watersheds in Maryland and North Carolina, which have differing mandates for comprehensive planning and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas. Established plan quality content analysis methods were adapted for water resource protection and extended to an ordinance quality analysis of riparian buffer policies. These riparian buffer policies were compared to development applications, which, in turn, were compared to high-resolution land cover classification maps to investigate policy slippage and implementation. The findings suggest comprehensive planning mandates without substantive guidance or geographically-limited mandates that only encourage extension to other sensitive areas are insufficient conditions for higher quality policy inputs. Low overall plan and ordinance quality scores highlight the gap between scientific knowledge accumulated about water resource protection and the planning inputs created and utilized by the planning profession. Finally, the three logistics regressions used to investigate the relationships among the quality of policy inputs, local context, and riparian buffer outcomes found statistically significant relationships. Conceptual groupings of both plan and ordinance quality principles as well as project-specific characteristics were associated with more tree cover and less impervious surface within the buffer. Additional research opportunities and immediate recommendations for planning monitoring and enforcement programs are provided.

AB  - In alley cropping annual food crops are grown in the interspaces between rows of planted tree species which are pruned periodically to provide green manure, fodder or mulch. Most of the interactions between the trees and the agricultural crop occur at the tree/crop interface. A field study was conducted at Columbus, Ohio, to determine the potential of alley cropping and to elucidate the interactions that occur at the maize/black locust interface. Below-ground fiberglass partitions were installed to a 100 cm depth to eliminate below-ground competition for some treatments. In the first year of tree growth, neither shading nor competition for soil moisture had a significant effect on maize growth or yield. The trees were too small to compete for light and the yield of the first maize row at the interface was slightly higher than others. The 18% reduction in maize yield per hectare was attributed to the 28% reduction in area planted to maize because the hedgerows replaced some maize rows. In the subsequent abnormally dry year, the results indicated that even under conditions of prolonged drought the effect of the hedgerows, in terms of competition for soil moisture in the top 45 cm soil depth, was restricted to within 76 cm of the hedgerows. However, the taller trees shaded the intercrop. When the established black locust trees were not pruned, up to 60% maize yield reduction was observed. When the trees were pruned maize yield was reduced by 34%, which was greater than the 18% yield reduction noted in the first year. This was partially attributed to the lower maize population compared to the first year. The study demonstrates the feasibility of alley cropping in Ohio. If producers wish to substitute part of their food crop production with tree production, competition for soil moisture may not be a serious limitation when black locust trees are used in the hedgerows. The reduction in annual crop yield can be compensated by biomass production of the hedgerow, and possibly reducing fertilizer inputs and enhancing soil and water conservation.

AB  - Although the Argentine ant has invaded most all the worlds regions with mediterranean and subtropical climates, several important aspects of its ecology are unpredictable: 1, its impact on seed dispersing ants, 2, its impact on nectar resources, and 3, the mechanisms that govern its spread through a landscape. I explored these aspects of the ant's ecology on the coast of central Chile and found 1. Argentine ants eliminate all native ants within fields and fragments of native forest except Solenopsis latastei. 2. While Solenopsis gayi and Pogonomyrmex ants remove seeds of 9/11 native plants from seed arenas, Argentine ants removed zero. 3. Flowers of the hummingbird pollinated Lobelia excelsa were strongly depleted of nectar by Argentine ants, but not by native ants. 4. Argentine ants are able to remove more nectar from L. excelsa chiefly because they persist at a much higher density than the native ants, and possibly because the most common native ants are too big to enter the nectar chamber of the flower. 5. Argentine ants invaded both hot dry fields and cool riparian sites. 6. Argentine ants invade the agro-ecological landscape by spreading through hedgerows and small clumps of native vegetation, and later invade overgrazed fields. 7. Until invaded, the dominant ant in these overgrazed fields ( Solenopsis gayi ) consumed seeds, and thus may have a trophic advantage over invading Argentine ants. 8. Argentine ants did not invade larger remnant forests (> 45m wide) that were often in ravines. I predict that Argentine ants will spread to most of the agro-ecosystems of the central coast of Chile. I propose that the spread of Argentine ants is limited by food availability, and that the hedgerows and patchy environments foster the ants invasion by fostering a variability in populations of insect prey, which the Argentine ant is adept at exploiting.

AB  - In 2005, approximately ten percent of the total farm land was being use for organic farming in Switzerland. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of organic farming on aspects such as soil and biodiversity. But what effect does organic farming have on the landscape? Can visible differences in the landscape be ascertained as a result of organic farming methods? This is the crucial issue addressed by this study which answers the question by comparing different farms, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A statistical analysis was made of data on the area managed by farms in Canton Zurich. A comparison is made between 300 IP (integrated production) farms using conventional methods and 140 farms using organic farming methods (130 under the Bud label with bio-organic production and 10 Demeter farms with bio-dynamic production). The qualitative approach comprises on the one hand the mapping of six farms (two IP, two Bud farms and two Demeter farms) for reference, to record the exact setting of the farmed areas and in particular to identify the ecological compensation areas in the landscape. On the other hand, the six farmers were interviewed to find out the motives for their particular method. To answer the crucial question, we illustrated the results from the quantitative and qualitative investigations of the farms by creating fictitious landscapes. Referring to the three different production methods, only slightly visible differences in the landscape can be ascertained. Even if the percentage of farms with organic production were greatly increased, the structural and morphological richness of the traditional rural landscape could not be restored. Nevertheless, the intensively used agrarian landscape would be richer in ecological compensation areas and be enhanced with more hedgerows and high-stem fruit trees.

AB  - The continued decrease in the quality of urban surface waters has directed many municipalities to question the influence of vegetation type and the use of phosphorus containing fertilizers on water quality. A study was conducted investigating the impact of impervious surface areas, the length of vegetated buffer strips, and turf or prairie plant communities on runoff water quality and quantity. Runoff plots consisted of two vegetation types, a Kentucky bluegrass ( Poa pratensis L.) blend or a commercially available urban prairie mixture of forbs and grasses. Three impervious to pervious surface ratios were also studied. Runoff was collected and total volumes recorded with samples later analyzed for sediment loading, total phosphorus, soluble phosphorus, soluble organic phosphorus, and bioavailable phosphorus. Turf and prairie vegetation did not influence annual runoff volumes when evaluated over a 12-month period. Turf allowed significantly (P ≤ 0.10) less runoff than prairie during non-frozen soil conditions. Winter runoff dominated annual volumes and overshadowed any effects from vegetation during non-frozen soil conditions. A 2:1 ratio of pervious: impervious surface significantly reduced runoff volumes compared to the 1:1 ratio. Both ecosystems allowed similar nutrient loading over a two-year period, 1.96 and 2.12 kg ha -1 yr-1 of total phosphorus for prairie and turf respectively. Fertilizer applications to turfgrass ecosystems did not increase nutrient runoff. Alternate sources of phosphorus pollution such as the leaching of vegetative tissues or atmospheric deposition may explain the similar results across both plant communities. Both low maintenance urban prairie and fertilized turfgrass ecosystems contributed similar nutrient loads to urban surface runoff waters. These levels may represent natural values to be expected in runoff from urban landscapes.

AB  - As urban populations increase globally, the conversion of natural land cover to anthropogenic land use is on the rise. Diffuse perturbations that accompany such land use changes are considered a chief threat to headwater streams, which provide habitat for diverse faunas of macroinvertebrates, fish, and amphibians and are important sources of sediments, nutrients, and organic matter for downstream systems. Although environmental assessments of stream ecosystems generally measure responses to these perturbations as shifts in community structures, functional rather than structural properties may provide a better indicator of land use impacts since measures of ecosystem function can reveal more about the mechanisms that alter running water ecosystems. The primary objective of this thesis was to quantify stream productivity along a gradient of forest cover and assess bottom-up and top-down mechanisms for observed patterns in stream productivity. In the first chapter, I quantified algal, invertebrate, and fish biomass, the single best correlate of productivity, at 38 first-third order streams along a forest cover gradient at 55 spatial scales and determined that subcatchment forest cover was consistently the best predictor of biomass at all trophic levels in terms of the variation explained by forest cover and the unexplained residual variance. When considering the independent effects of forest cover on biomass at three coarse scales, subcatchment forest cover was the only significant predictor of biomass, suggesting that the common practice of maintaining riparian buffers is an ineffective management practice for protecting stream function from catchment-wide impacts. In the second chapter, I developed two time-saving approaches for processing benthic invertebrate samples that reduced laboratory processing time by 37% and 82% and provided production estimates that were strongly related to production estimates obtained from standard processing techniques. These time-saving approaches were used in chapter 3 so that I could measure algal, invertebrate, and fish production at 12 sites along a gradient of subcatchment forest cover, which I determined to be the most influential spatial scale on biomass in chapter 1. Total nitrogen was a significant bottom-up force that explained 34-83% of the variation in stream productivity at all three trophic levels. However, consumer production to consumption ratios indicated that predators and grazers can potentially deplete their food sources, and that top-down forces are therefore also important contributors to observed patterns in productivity and biomass along the forested gradient.

AB  - In the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario clearcutting and fire are two common edge-creating disturbances. Fundamental knowledge regarding the ability of fire and clearcut edges to minimize edge effects, preserve interior habitat, and provide sources of vegetative growth is lacking. Development of sustainable forest management strategies that emulate natural disturbance relies upon such information. This thesis examines edge effects in the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario at conifer clearcut, deciduous clearcut, and conifer fire edges. Riparian buffers with an upland clearcut edge and an upland-riparian ecotone were also studied. Edge effects were explored on a number of scales ranging from landscape-level to stand-level to small-scale bryophyte response. Residual patch, core area and edge were assessed in 1000 ha and 250 ha windows in both clearcut and fire disturbance. At the stand-level canopy and understory conditions were sampled along transects (60 m) placed across edges and buffers, in comparison to transects in the interior forest or at undisturbed stream edges.

AB  - Riparian wildlife is important in maintaining watercourse ecological integrity, yet present riparian buffer guidelines often fail to maintain sufficient terrestrial habitat for riparian species. A literature review was undertaken to assess the terrestrial habitat requirements of riparian obligates using the American beaver ( Castor canadensis ) as a focal species. Published data indicates that a 50-m-wide riparian area in its natural state can support many riparian obligates as well as the ecological functions provided by riparian vegetation. GIS analysis showed that a 50-m-wide riparian buffer, measured from the edge of the watercourse and its adjacent wetlands, represents 15% of the land in the Upper Mersey River watershed. Exclusion of forestry activities in this buffer decreases the potential timber harvest by approximately 10% compared to present practices. To conserve wide-ranging riparian obligates (moose; some species of turtles, amphibians and odonates), riparian buffers should be integrated in a connectivity plan for the entire watershed.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the changes in sediment phosphorus (P) dynamics in an effluent-driven stream over a four-year period where hydrology and watershed P management changed dramatically, and evaluate soil and sediment P dynamics at the Columbia Hollow catchment in northwest Arkansas, USA. Long-term sediment and water samples were collected approximately 3 km downstream from the effluent discharge October 2003 through September 2007. During summer 2007 soil and sediment samples were also collected from 16 sites including three pastures, three forested areas, three riparian zones, three eroded stream banks, three fluvial channels, and one ephemeral tributary stream. During all 132 benthic sediment sorption isotherm experiments, sediments adsorbed and desorbed P when P spike concentrations were greater and less than sediment equilibrium P concentrations (EPC 0 ), respectively (p≤0.031). Benthic sediment (EPC0 ) was greater than dissolved P concentrations in the stream water 75% of the sample dates, indicating the bed materials within the fluvial channel were mainly a dissolved-P source to the water column. As dissolved P concentrations in the stream water decreased the sediment Mehlich-3 P content increased (r=0.40, p=0.019). Mehlich-3 P, water-extractable P, exchangeable P, and soil and sediment EPC 0 were typically greatest in the pasture soils, followed by the riparian soils, than the fluvial channel sediments and forest soils, and eroded bank sediments had the least.

AB  - The objective of this research was to provide a tool to show landowners and governmental agencies the costs versus benefits associated with implementation and maintenance of a designed riparian buffer system. The spatial/economic framework relies on interpretation of remotely sensed data, parameters of existing incentive programs, and quantification of secondary benefits. The framework can accommodate for future changes in incentive programs and could be used for further modeling in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. For a case study, the Sugar Creek Watershed located in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was chosen. It has been heavily farmed for decades. Due to morphological changes within the stream system and poor land management practices, the stream system has become extremely unstable. Riparian degradation is common throughout the system. Results from this research indicate that it is more profitable to take all pasture types out of production in riparian areas and put them into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The research has also concluded that it is more profitable for most wheat producers to put land into CRP, when erosion is considered in riparian areas. Peanuts and alfalfa were more profitable in production than in an incentive program. Externality costs in the system are high and implementation of riparian buffers as a stabilizing force in the system appears to be cost-effective. The results from the application of this framework will assist in implementation of riparian buffers as a best management practice. It gives the landowner a specific economic breakdown of the costs of the practice versus the profitability of continued farming. In addition, the framework provides the decision-maker with data that will assist them in determining objectives and goals for managing their respective watersheds.

AB  - Forested headwater streams rely on riparian zones for many critical products and services. Riparian areas shade streams, stabilize stream banks, filter sediment, and provide allochthonous materials like leaves, large woody debris (LWD), and terrestrial invertebrates (TI's). Logging can affect the products and services of riparian zones. Best management practices (BMP's) have been developed to minimize the impacts of riparian timber harvest on streams. The main component of these guidelines is the establishment of a road-free riparian buffer called a streamside management zone (SMZ). The West Virginia Division of Forestry's BMP's require a SMZ that is at least 30 m wide for perennial and intermittent streams. There is no harvest limit within the SMZ, although heavy equipment cannot be operated within the area. This study quantified the effect of LWD additions and riparian tree harvest intensity at 50% and 90% basal area harvest (BAH) on various biotic and abiotic characteristics of eight Appalachian headwater streams. Stream temperatures and pool formation rates were affected by the treatments. Stream temperature increased as canopy cover decreased. During the warmest days in summer, water temperature within 90% BAH sections reached levels that could be stressful or lethal to salmonids. The combination of 50% BAH sections and unharvested sections appeared to maintain natural thermal regimes. Neither the BAH nor the LWD treatments had an effect on stream turbidity or sedimentation rates within the experimental sections. The haphazard LWD additions resulted in no net increase in pool area. However, a greater number of pools were created and destroyed in the LWD addition sections. LWD additions also increased habitat complexity and most likely decreased the long-term LWD deficit that often occurs following logging operations. Periphyton biomass increased with decreasing canopy coverage. Temperature and alkalinity did not significantly affect periphyton biomass, although the temperature gradient was small. Trends of increasing periphyton biomass were observed with canopy reductions as small as 6.4%. TI inputs, a critical food source for trout, were affected by the BAH treatments. TI input biomass was significantly higher in the 90% BAH sections. TI input composition varied significantly between years (natural variation) and between the reference and 90% BAH sections. At greater harvest intensities, increases of Acrididae and Tettigoniidae (Orthoptera), wood-associated coleopterans, Formicidae (ants) and pollinating hymenopterans were observed. Aquatic invertebrates (AI's) were, for the most part, unaffected by the treatments. AI abundance, richness, and biomass were not affected by the BAH or LWD treatments. AI abundance and biomass was significantly affected by natural annual variation. AI communities were not affected by the treatments, although a significant and more-direct relationship was observed between decreasing canopy coverage and increasing grazing taxa biomass. The results of this study suggest that riparian tree harvesting affects stream temperature, periphyton biomass, TI inputs, and to a lesser degree, AI's. Following riparian harvesting, AI and fish production may increase via increases in periphyton biomass and TI input biomass. However, observed increases in stream temperature created conditions that would have been metabolically and physiologically stressful for salmonids. Riparian zones with 50% BAH and alternating unharvested sections appears to minimize the thermal impacts of riparian tree harvesting.

AB  - Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata, is attacked in the field by cowpea curculio, Chalcodermus aeneus, in the southeastern United States, and in both the field and in storage by Bruchidius atrolineatus, Apion (Piezotrachelus) varium, and cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus, in West Africa. In field surveys of vegetation in cowpea field borders, cowpea curculio was found feeding on alternate host plants in Alabama and B. atrolineatus, A. varium, and cowpea weevil were found feeding on alternate host plants in northern Cameroon. Adults from each of these pest species fed on pollen and nectar from several alternate hosts. Cowpea curculio adults also fed on pods, stems, and floral parts of several alternate hosts and overwintered on three grass species. Each of the beetle species studied reproduced on alternate host plant species of the subfamily Phaseolinae (Fabaceae). Vegetational management of alternate host plants may reduce the numbers of these insect pests in cowpea in Alabama and northern Cameroon. Numbers of cowpea curculios and their stings (pod punctures) were greater in Alabama cowpea fields where cowpea had been produced in the previous growing season. Cowpea curculio adults exhibited edge effects in their invasion patterns in Alabama cowpea fields from plant emergence until pod formation. Taylor's power law analysis indicated that counts of cowpea curculio stings per pod were aggregated, which may be useful in the development of a presence-absence sampling plan. Kuno's method indicated that a necessary sample size of more than 158 pods would be required to effectively sample the tolerance level for proportion of pods with stings. In cowpea fields in northern Cameroon, more B. atrolineatus eggs were found than C. maculatus eggs. A trichogrammatid wasp, Uscana lariophaga Steffan, parasitized 32% of B. atrolineatus eggs and 51% of C. maculatus eggs. Brief edge effects were detected for unparasitized B. atrolineatus eggs and parasitized B. atrolineatus and C. maculatus eggs. Taylor's power law analysis revealed that counts of adults and eggs of B. atrolineatus were aggregated in distribution, while counts of C. maculatus adults and eggs were apparently random; information that may be useful in the development of sampling plans.

AB  - Efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay have focused on reducing agricultural nutrient losses. In particular, riparian buffer restoration has been an important component of nutrient reduction strategies, and one program used extensively to restore riparian vegetation on agricultural land is the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). I evaluated the effect of CREP on water quality on the Delmarva Peninsula by measuring groundwater nutrients under restored buffers on two farms, monitoring stream baseflow in 30 small watersheds (or subbasins), and monitoring stream stormflow in two subbasins. On the farms, nitrate concentrations were lower in the restored buffers than in the non-buffered sites, suggesting that buffer restoration was successful in filtering groundwater nitrate. In groundwater under a 7 year old CREP buffer, dilution by infiltration of rainwater accounted for 56% of the total nitrogen reduction, and denitrification accounted for 15 to 30%. At the watershed scale, CREP restored 1 to 30% of total streamline in 15 agriculturally-dominated subbasins in the Choptank River. However, I did not detect differences in nitrogen concentrations between these subbasins based on the amount of buffer restoration. Nitrogen concentrations actually increased in most of the streams since previous monitoring before restoration; therefore, buffers may not be extensive enough to have measurable affects on baseflow water quality. However, comparison of stormflow between two subbasins revealed significant nutrient differences. Total buffered streamline was greater and more widely distributed in Blockston than in Norwich subbasin. The amount and distribution of CREP may have influenced the stormflow nutrient yields, which were 2 times higher in Norwich versus Blockston. Lastly, I reviewed 20 years of stream monitoring data from German Branch subbasin in the context of all agricultural management practices implemented in the basin. A decade after management, I detected a 33% decrease in phosphorus concentrations in stream baseflow, but no significant changes in nitrogen concentrations. However, the rate of increase of 0.14 mg N L -1 yr-1 prior to management did not continue to present-day baseflow conditions and may have been suppressed by management practices. While these results are somewhat encouraging, complete understanding of watershed-scale effects of riparian buffers will require further interdisciplinary study.

AB  - This dissertation reports the results of various studies that may contribute to the development of integrated programs for managing insects that are potential contaminants of spinach and greens. Spinach samples were analyzed in attempts to determine the source of resistance against the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer). A resistant breeding line had significantly lower soluble peroxidase activity than the commercial variety 'Grandstand'. Oxalate levels were measured by a method intended for quantifying oxalate in human urine. Aphid infested greenhouse plants had significantly greater oxalate levels than greenhouse plants without aphids. Laboratory bioassays with green peach aphids were conducted on samples from field-treated spinach and mustard greens to determine the persistence of aphicides. Persistence of triazamate and dimethoate were similar on spinach. Triazamate resulted in greater aphid mortality through time on mustard greens than did dimethoate. Spinach plants infested with green peach aphids were used in laboratory studies to determine the systemic activity of three recently developed aphicides. Suggested rates of triazamate, through systemic movement in the plant, were sufficient to control $\ge$90% of aphids on non-treated leaves. Imidacloprid also produced a level of aphid control through systemic activity, however, the suggested rate was not as effective against aphids on non-treated leaves as that of triazamate. Mortality from pymetrozine was erratic on both treated and non-treated plant parts. Field grown spinach plants, naturally infested with aphids, were examined to develop a sampling method for aphids on spinach. Significant linear relationships were found between aphid numbers on selected plant parts and total aphids on the entire plant. Sweep samples and observations were conducted to determine species composition and distribution of grasshoppers in fall-grown turnip and collard greens fields and surrounding vegetation in the Arkansas River Valley. Grasshoppers were often observed in greens, but this was more common later in the season, after nearby soybean had begun to senesce. Mapping of grasshopper distribution within and around greens fields revealed that grasshoppers were most abundant along field edges adjacent to senescing soybean, weeds, or bare ground, depending on grasshopper species.

AB  - Agricultural runoff is a major non-point source pollutant in the Midwest and has been documented as a significant contributor to nutrient loads in the Mississippi River and subsequent hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. In an attempt to minimize eutrophication, researchers have been collaborating with farmers to improve best management practices targeting nutrient retention. Over the past four decades riparian buffers have proven effective in retaining nutrients and sediment from agricultural runoff. We hypothesize that the addition of biochar to vegetated buffers can further improve nutrient attenuation by enhancing nutrient adsorption and cycling soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. In June 2012, fifteen flumes were established adjacent to fifteen existing flumes that were installed in 2008 for a related study at Southern Illinois University's farms. Each flume was either vegetated and/or amended with one of ten treatments and replicated three times: 1) giant cane ( Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl) established in 2008; 2) Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.); 3) orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.); 4) giant cane and compost (i.e., horse manure and mushroom compost); 5) biochar (i.e., pine and oak feedstock pyrolyzed between 450 °C and 650 °C.); 6) biochar and giant cane; 7) biochar, giant cane, and compost; 8) corn; 9) volunteer herbaceous species; and 10) a non-amended, non-vegetated control. Soil samples were collected prior to the application of soil amendments and nutrients were assessed annually. Surface runoff samples were collected from significant rain events (i.e., precipitation > 2.5 cm) and analyzed for nutrient and sediment levels. Data indicate that various combinations of biochar, compost, and giant cane were successful at reducing the frequency of surface runoff events as well as reducing concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in agricultural surface runoff. Concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were greatly reduced when biochar and giant cane were present in the buffer without the addition of compost. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were lowest for the established giant cane treatment. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) among the various buffer treatments. Data from this study are promising for the incorporation of biochar, compost, and giant cane into vegetated buffers to reduce the concentration of nutrients in agricultural surface runoff.

AB  - In the Pacific Northwest, water quality degradation due to elevated stream temperature and the threat it imposes on cold-water fish species, especially the economically important salmon fisheries, has been of great concern during recent years. Stream temperature, like other water quality parameters, is believed to be largely affected by a number of factors, but land use change, especially urbanization is of particular concern. The accurate measurement of stream temperatures is important for both identifying environmentally detrimental temperatures as well as being able to monitor compliance with water quality standards relating to water temperature. Two different measurement systems for stream temperature, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery and in-stream temperature loggers, are used to relate the spatial and temporal variability in water temperatures to environmental conditions. This research first utilizes both five-meter and fifteen-meter airborne TIR imagery collected for the Green-Duwamish River basin in Washington State, USA to assess how the spatial variability of stream temperature is affected by land use within the watershed. As part of this analysis, we also explore how stream temperature changes over different time intervals from minutes to hours to days, so that we can better interpret changes in observed temperature that were collected over a span of several hours. In the second part of this research, daily in-stream temperature data for the mainstem Green-Duwamish River basin and a tributary, Soos Creek, were analyzed to identify relationships between urban development and stream temperature. Analysis of overlapping TIR images indicated that stream temperature change was negligible on the order of a few minutes between neighboring images, but that temperature increased on the order of 2-3 °C between the first and last image of the five-meter dataset. Despite the increase, mean reach segment stream temperature was lower in areas with less urbanization and thus more riparian vegetation, while it increased with the urban fraction within each watershed subsection. Spatial variability was found to decrease with urbanization, and increase with distance from the reservoir. This suggests that increased riparian zone shading and additional in-stream materials such a rocks and woody-debris that are more prevalent in less urbanized areas contribute to an increase in stream temperature variability and the likely presence of cold water refugia which are very important to the sustained health of the aquatic ecosystem. In-stream temperature observations in the Soos Creek watershed identified a statistically significant increase in cool season water temperatures and decrease in variability with increased urban land use within the riparian buffer zone upstream of the sampling sites. This is directly related to an increase in cool season minimum water temperatures, which is indicative of increased overland flow due to impervious surfaces. Both observation methods found an increase in average water temperature and a decrease in spatial and temporal variability with an increase in urban area. Each measurement system provided insight into the thermal regime of the Green-Duwamish River basin but together they provided more insight into the temporal and spatial variation of the system than either could alone.

AB  - Models of the topographic influence on debris flow initiation and wind damage are used to assess the influence of forest clearcutting patterns (i.e., location, size, shape and distribution of cut units) on the potential for debris flow initiation and wind damage in Charley Creek watershed, Washington (11.5 km$\sp2$). Clearcutting patterns consisted of a combination of square or rectangular clearcut units in two sizes distributed either in an aggregated or dispersed pattern under three stream-buffering scenarios. Total area in clearcut units for each cutting pattern was approximately 52 ha. Potentially unstable ground was predicted to be concentrated along steep headwater streams and inner-gorge side-slopes. The location of clearcut units was the most important factor influencing the potential for shallow landsliding while the location, size, shape, and interactions among these three factors were important influences on the potential for wind damage. Manipulation of size and geometric shape of clearcut units are predicted to be more effective for reducing potential wind damage to remaining forest stands adjacent to clearcut units than for shallow landsliding. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to investigate the spatial coincidence between various buffer widths and extents and potentially unstable ground delineated using a physically-based model for the minimum steady-state rainfall required to cause shallow landsliding in watersheds of Charley and Owl Creeks on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. The proportion of potentially unstable ground protected by riparian buffer zones is a function of both the width and extent of the channel network being buffered. Buffering all channels with 100 m buffers protected between 75 to 90% of the potentially unstable areas whereas buffering only small headwater channels (Type 9) with 100 m wide leave areas protected 45 to 60% of the potentially unstable areas. The analyses show that (1) riparian buffer zones are not very efficient for protecting potentially unstable ground; (2) wide buffer zones along steep headwater channels can more efficiently protect potentially unstable ground; and (3) no-cut leave areas designed using a physically-based model for the topographic control on shallow landsliding provide a more efficient method to reduce shallow landsliding hazards than extensive buffer zones along stream channels.

AB  - Scope and method of study . The study examined the effectiveness of manure compared to lime in reducing aluminum toxicity and increasing plant growth, investigated the contributions of pH increase, organic materials and phosphorus addition to the alleviation of aluminum toxicity associated with manure application and studied the effect of alum-treated manure on properties of an acid soil and plant growth. Nutrient management using GIS was also included in this study. Pot experiment was conducted by growing winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L .) sensitive to Al toxicity. Wheat growth was correlated with soil extractable Al, feedlot manure, poultry litter and alum-treated poultry litter application rates. Lab incubation experiment also performed by applying feedlot manure to soil, adjusting soil pH and adding phosphorus to investigate the overall effect, pH effect and phosphorus effect on the reduction of extractable aluminum associated with manure application. The effect of organic materials on reducing extractable aluminum was calculated. ArcView GIS was used to map buffer zones, soil nutrient distributions and fertilizer recommendations. Findings and conclusion . Feedlot manure and poultry litter increased soil pH, reduced CaCl2 extractable Al and exchangeable Al in soil although their effects per unit mass were not as high as lime. However, at the same aluminum level, poultry litter was more effective on the increase of wheat growth than feedlot manure and lime. Animal manure applied to acid soils not only provided plant nutrients but also reduced aluminum toxicity. Organic binding with Al played a more important role than pH increase and phosphorus addition did associated with manure application. Application of alum-treated poultry litter had the potential to increase soil NH 4 -N by prevent NO3 -N formation but was not as efficient in supplying P nutrient and reducing Al toxicity as untreated poultry litter. The digital maps of nutrient distributions, crop arrangement, and fertilizer recommendations provide useful tools for farmers and the methodology in this study can be used in other farms.

AB  - This thesis deals with soil parameters that affect the regulation of denitrification following application of the herbicide. Roundup, to bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.). Denitrification, soil moisture and NO$\sb3\sp-$ increased substantially following vegetation death. Several C parameters were reduced seven weeks and one year following herbicide application suggesting C availability to denitrifiers was dependent upon C supply from vegetation. Boundary-line analysis indicated moisture, NO$\sb3\sp-$ and respiration regulated denitrification. Boundary-line analysis also indicated denitrification increased with the Roundup treatment because of reduced limitation to denitrification imposed by NO$\sb3\sp-$ and moisture. Laboratory incubation and kinetic experiments indicated that increased NO$\sb3\sp-$ following death of vegetation could result in increased denitrification. Using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the half-saturation constant (K$\sb{\rm N}$) for NO$\sb3\sp-$ was found to decrease 200 times when C was supplied as 60 mM glucose-C. This indicated that the response in denitrification to NO$\sb3\sp-$ concentration is dependent upon C availability.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to determine what effect buffering seasonal ponds following harvest of adjacent upland forest has on pond hydrology; as well as to investigate soil morphology associated with these ponds. Study areas were established in north central Minnesota in 2000 and buffer treatments assigned randomly to ponds included: control, uncut buffer, partial buffer, and clearcut buffer. One year of pre-harvest and five years of post-harvest data was collected to examine hydrologic characteristics and distinguish any differences between buffer treatments. Soil texture and hydraulic conductivity was analyzed to determine the influence on formation of seasonal ponds on the landscape. The results suggest that it is possible to manipulate hydrologic characteristics in seasonal ponds following upland harvest based on the type of buffer treatment. The presence of both Bt horizon formation and lithologic discontinuity suggests seasonal pond formation can be attributed to both geogenic and pedogenic processes.

AB  - Conservation of highly erodible, intensively tilled, upland soils in the humid tropics is necessary to sustain crop production and minimize erosion. The objective of this field study, located at Claveria, the Philippines, was to evaluate the effects of four soil management treatments on soil erosion control and corn (Zea mays L.) production on fertilized and limed fields with slope gradients ranging from 13 to 22%. Four treatments were: contour moldboard plowing (CP), contour ridge tillage (RT), contour natural grass barrier strips plus moldboard plowing (GCP), and contour natural grass barrier strips plus ridge tillage (GRT). Successive eight corn trials were conducted from 1992 through 1995. Soil movement by tillage was estimated using "soil movement tracers" (SMT), painted 12-mm hexagonal steel nuts, buried in 1994 and excavated in 1996 after tilling the land for four successive corn crops. Mean annual soil flux was estimated based on SMT displacement distance, and nomograms were developed to compute tillage-induced soil loss. The 1995 mean corn grain yields for RT (10.8 Mg ha$\sp{-1})$ and GRT (10.3 Mg ha$\sp{-1})$ were significantly higher than CP (10.0 Mg ha$\sp{-1})$ and GCP (9.6 Mg ha$\sp{-1}).$ The mean corn yields for the CP and RT systems before 1995 ranged from 1.3 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ in 1992 to 8.4 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ in 1993, while comparable GCP and GRT yields ranged from 1.4 to 7.6 Mg ha$\sp{-1}.$ Mean annual soil flux was estimated to be 241 kg m$\sp{-1}$ for CP, 131 kg m$\sp{-1}$ for RT, 158 kg m$\sp{-1}$ for GCP, and 112 kg m$\sp{-1}$ for GRT. Compared to the estimated mean annual soil loss for CP of 63 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$, soil loss was reduced by 30% for GCP, 45% for RT, and 55% for GRT. Displacement of SMT and estimated tillage erosion rates were directly related to slope length, slope gradient, and tillage method. Using granite rocks as SMT in a nearby companion field experiment, mean annual tillage erosion rates at 25% slope gradient were estimated 456 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for UMP (moldboard plowing up and downslope) and 382 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for CP. At 36% slope gradient, comparable values were 601 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for UMP and 598 Mg ha$\sp{-1}$ for CP system. The RT system reduced the tillage erosion rate by about 70% on both slopes compared to CP and UMP. These results indicate that both contour ridge tillage and natural grass barrier strips at approximately 9-m contour intervals break the continuum of downhill slope length, gradually reduce the steepness of the land surface, and reduce soil displacement, soil translocation flux, and tillage erosion rates.

AB  - I assessed age-related differences in the botanical composition of beetle banks, considering potential degradation as overwintering sites, and resource provision for other wildlife. A dense structure was retained, despite age, thus banks continue to be functional for predators for over a decade at least. Increasing summer floral diversity with age may also benefit other insects. Weed presence was no worse than conventional margins, and so control should be relatively straightforward. Associated with this work was an evaluation of whether levels of polyphagous invertebrates, previously reported as high in new sites, were sustained in older beetle banks. I discovered little difference in densities per m2 between beetle banks and conventional field margins, regardless of age, while boundary-overwintering carabid densities increased though time. Predator diversity was also similar between habitat types through the year. A large-scale trapping experiment was undertaken to evaluate the spatial-temporal patterns of predatory Carabidae in fields adjacent to beetle banks through the crop season. A novel spatial analysis was used to explore the distributions of different species groups. I found evidence to support the description of a 'wave' of boundary-species emerging from refuges and dispersing across the field. In contrast, field-inhabiting species were slow to develop from field centres and may be of less value for pest control. Beetle banks appear as valuable as conventional boundaries for aiding carabid dispersal into crops. Subtle microclimate, prey distribution or edaphic factors probably accounted for the spatially and temporally fluctuating activity-densities of beetles observed through the season. In addition, the abundance of predatory Empididae was similar within a beetle bank and a hedgerow, with a low, homogenous presence at increasing distances from them, coinciding in time with serious cereal pests. Thus beetle banks may also contribute useful habitat resource for these little studied insects.I hypothesised that simple sown grass strips would contain a lower diversity of other invertebrates when compared to older, botanically complex habitats, although this difference might lessen with age. There was evidence to support this view.

AB  - The perennial herbaceous understorey found in well-maintained hedgerow and grassy field margins provides resources or refuge for a highly diverse fauna. I assessed age-related differences in the botanical composition of beetle banks, considering potential degradation as overwintering sites, and resource provision for other wildlife. A dense structure was retained, despite age, thus banks continue to be functional for predators for over a decade at least. Increasing summer floral diversity with age may also benefit other insects. Weed presence was no worse than conventional margins, and so control should be relatively straightforward. Associated with this work was an evaluation of whether levels of polyphagous invertebrates, previously reported as high in new sites, were sustained in older beetle banks. I discovered little difference in densities per m 2 between beetle banks and conventional field margins, regardless of age, while boundary-overwintering carabid densities increased though time. Predator diversity was also similar between habitat types through the year. A large-scale trapping experiment was undertaken to evaluate the spatial-temporal patterns of predatory Carabidae in fields adjacent to beetle banks through the crop season. A novel spatial analysis was used to explore the distributions of different species groups. I found evidence to support the description of a 'wave' of boundary-species emerging from refuges and dispersing across the field. In contrast, field-inhabiting species were slow to develop from field centres and may be of less value for pest control. I hypothesised that simple sown grass strips would contain a lower diversity of other invertebrates when compared to older, botanically complex habitats, although this difference might lessen with age. There was evidence to support this view. Beetle banks were found to contain useful, albeit lower, densities of game bird chick-food, when compared with conventional field margins; additionally furnishing nesting cover for adult birds. Severe declines in wild game are attributed to losses of these invertebrates vital for chick survival, as well as inadequate provision of nesting and brood-rearing habitat. A supplementary chapter of this thesis describes the findings of a questionnaire survey sent to a cohort of farmers in southern England, to elucidate their current perceptions, opinions and use of the beetle bank design.

AB  - In the spring of 2008 two natural gas wells were drilled at the Alto Experimental Watersheds. At the first site (F-1), the well pad was constructed directly in the channel of an intermittent headwater stream and had a total watershed area of 13.7 ha with the area disturbed by the well pad comprising 1.4 ha. At the second site (F-2), the pad was constructed 15 m from the creek channel, with a total watershed area of 4.5 ha and an area disturbed by well pad construction of 1.1 ha. Downstream from each respective well pad, a v-notch weir was installed to measure discharge. Sediment collected in the drop box section of the weir was weighed after each runoff event. Water samples from these runoff events were collected at the mouth of the weir for water quality analysis. Data obtained from the storm water runoff were then compared to the results of previous studies at the Alto Watersheds contrasting the difference in the impacts of silviculture to natural gas development. In addition to observed field data, the ArcAPEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental Extender) Model was used to estimate land use effects. ArcAPEX was used to estimate residual impacts and to test different precipitation regimes and evaluate the resulting variation. In spite of persistent drought conditions throughout the duration of the study, notable differences were observed between the two sites. Overall sediment losses were six and a half times greater at F-1 than F-2. Sediment accumulation was so great that it compromised the flow measuring equipment installed in the weirs. Consequently, flow data were estimated using ArcAPEX. Sediment losses at both sites were considerably greater in terms of losses per unit area of disturbance than any of the values observed in the silviculture studies. Losses per unit area were 26094 kg ha -1 at the site where the pad was constructed in stream and 4100 kg ha -1 where the pad was offset from the stream with a riparian buffer. In the silviculture studies losses per unit area were 2409 kg ha-1 in the treatments where no Best Management Practices (BMPs) were used, and 208 kg ha-1 in the treatments that used BMPs. Nutrient yields were also consistently greater at F-1, further emphasizing the importance of well pad placement in proximity to nearby streams. Analysis of these data illustrated the considerable difference in impacts placed on surface water quality compared to standard silvicultural practices, further emphasizing the need for (BMPs) for natural gas development.

AB  - A 3-year field study was initiated in 1994 near Brooksville, MS on a silty clay soil to evaluate the effects of varying widths of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) filter strips on metribuzin and metolachlor losses from conventionally tilled soybean. Filter strip widths evaluated included 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 m. Total losses from the unfiltered treatment were 9.8 and 6.5% of the applied for metribuzin and metolachlor, respectively. The addition of a filter strip, regardless of width, reduced these amounts to no more than 2.6 and 2.1% of metribuzin and metolachlor, respectively. Although, there were no differences among filter strip widths on the reduction of metolachlor and metribuzin losses, when compared to the unfiltered treatment, the addition of a filter strip reduced metolachlor and metribuzin losses by at least 68 and 74%, respectively. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate flumetsulam mobility in three Mississippi soils of varied organic matter and soil texture as influenced by precipitation interval. Mobility was examined using packed soil columns under Unsaturated-saturated flow conditions. Precipitation intervals consisted of 0, 3, and 5 days after treatment. $\sp{14}$C-flumetsulam was mobile when precipitation immediately followed flumetsulam application, with 15 to 39% recovered in leachate from all soils. When the precipitation interval was delayed 3 days after treatment, leachate amounts were reduced to 12 to 19%. By delaying the precipitation interval 5 days after treatment, leachate amounts were further reduced, with 5 to 16% recovered in the leachate.

AB  - In this study an investigation is made of the role or porous vegetation structures for the collection of ambient aerosols, the key aim being to quantify the potential of such natural barriers as sinks for particulate pollution. First, a model for estimating the size-segregated particle collection efficiencies of an arbitrary porous barrier is developed to assess the driving factors influencing the collection process. Collection efficiency (CE) is described in terms of the coupled effects of the deviation of the approach flow (CEflow) and the filtration through the foliage elements (CEfiltration). This model is then tested on three hedgerow species, of different aerodynamic porosities, in the particle size range 0.5-20μm. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to simulate the velocity fields and turbulence around the hedgerows, leading to identification of prominent flow separation zones in the wake of denser barriers. A number of turbulence models of varying complexities have been tested to attain greater accuracy in the simulated profiles. In the particle size range studied, CEflow and CEfiltration ranged between 66-83.5% and 2.8-35.2% respectively for the more porous hawthorn hedge, leading to overall CE values of 1.8-30%. Values of the corresponding parameters for the denser hedge (yew) ranged between 17.5-20.5% and 4.7-14.8%, leading to overall CE of 0.8-3%. The predicted urban background concentrations of ammonium, sulphates and nitrates were found to be in good agreement with recently published data. The predicted CEfiltration for ammonium, nitrate and carbonyl groups from FTIR analyses was found to be much higher than for aliphatic carbon and sulphates, which lie in the ranges of 15-24% and 5-10% respectively.

AB  - Riparian buffers have received a significant amount of attention within the Chesapeake Bay watershed to improve water quality. Riparian buffers help control the stream environment, control sediment and sediment-borne pollutants, control nitrates in shallow groundwater, and help control dissolved phosphorous. Voluntary programs were established in Maryland to encourage landowners to install riparian buffers. Understanding what motivates landowners to install buffers and their socioeconomic characteristics are key to a successful voluntary program. This study provides an analysis of Maryland farmers' installation of riparian buffers. A probit model was used to analyze data collected from a telephone survey, performed June 2000, of 411 Maryland farm landowners. The analysis revealed that two land characteristics; acres and location on the Lower Eastern Shore; and four owner characteristics; age, making production decisions on the farm themselves, participation in government conservation programs and hearing about riparian buffers, are significant determinants for predicting the adoption of riparian buffer technology. All of these characteristics have a positive relationship with riparian buffer adoption.

AB  - Chromatomyia fuscula (Zetterstedt) is a univoltine pest in Norwegian cereal fields, ovipositing in young leaves in late spring. The larvae mine the leaves and pupate in the mine. The adults overwinter in unknown habitats. The objective of this thesis was to get an overview of the parasitoids attacking C. fuscula in Norwegian cereals (species, distribution, biology, annual fluctuations, importance of field margins), and the mortality they impose on C. fuscula. Methods included Malaise traps, emergence traps, trap plants, rearing and dissection. Forty thousand adult C. fuscula and 55 000 adult parasitoids were collected, and 13 000 mines dissected. The thesis consists of 5 papers, including an overview of the biology of the 25 parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea & Ichneumonoidea) found. All were solitary. Most of them attacked larvae, but the most common one, Cyrtogaster vulgaris Walker, attacked pupae. Cirrospilus vittatus Walker, Diglyphus begini (Ashmead) and Chrysocharis pubicornis (Zetterstedt) were also numerous. In fields $>$62$\sp\circ$N or $>$200 m altitude, some preadult parasitoids were found dormant. These were assumed to prepare for overwintering in C. fuscula. In the best studied field (an organic field in S.-E. Norway), the parasitoid complex was followed through several years. The species list varied little. C. vulgaris was more dominant in the field boundary than in the crop. Emergence traps in the spring revealed several species trying to overwinter in the barley crop (presumably in alternative hosts) also in this southern lowland field. C. vulgaris was the only parasitoid overwintering as adult, and was found overwintering in higher densities in the boundary than in the crop. The average percentage of C. fuscula mines producing a parasitid was $<$20. Unexplained C. fuscula mortality was at least as high as successful parasitization. The unexplained mortality could be due to parasitoid activity, but may well have other causes. A combination of annual ploughing and lack of alternative hosts out of field probably explains why parasitization of C. fuscula was not higher.

AB  - Monte Carlo simulation was used to examine the on-farm economics from adoption of Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) on five representative Alberta cropping farms. Adoption of shelterbelts, buffer strips, residue management, and the addition of annual and perennial forages, field peas, and oats in crop rotations were included as BMPs that contribute positively to Ecological Goods and Service production from agriculture. Results suggest positive on-farm benefits associated with perennial forage and field pea BMPs. Conversely, BMPs that reduce availability of land for cropping activities, such as shelterbelts and buffer strips, and BMPs that do not increase revenues, such as oats and annual forages in rotation, are costly to producers. The results of this thesis have important policy implications. Policy mechanisms that incorporate positive mechanisms may improve adoption of BMPs that are costly to producers, while extension mechanisms, such as information programs, may improve the adoption of economically feasible BMPs.

AB  - The Canaan-Washademoak watershed, located in southern New Brunswick, is experiencing a problem with riparian vegetation maintenance, resulting in declining environmental quality. The primary objective of this thesis was to complete a cost-benefit analysis of increased riparian preservation along the Canaan River and its main tributaries for the purpose of improving the water, habitat, and scenic quality. To this end, two contingent valuation surveys were developed to assess the relevant costs and benefits. A landowner survey, achieving a response rate of 53%, was sent to a random sample of riparian landowners in the watershed to estimate the cost. A public survey, which achieved a response rate of 29%, was sent to a random sample of southern New Brunswick households and watershed property owners to estimate the benefit. The results provide support for the preservation of a 3D-metre riparian buffer, but provide little support for preserving a 60-metre buffer.

AB  - This study was conducted to develop a simplified method of obtaining future climate data inputs for natural resource models and apply that method to three locations within the continental United States to assess the effect of climate change on soil erosion, runoff, and fire risk. A method was developed for quickly obtaining future climate data over a wide range of scenarios, General Circulation Models (GCMs), and timescales from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) and Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) model families using the MarkSim ® DSSAT Weather Generator and a Microsoft Excel VBA Macro, the final result being a properly formatted parameter file which can be used by CLIGEN (CLImate GENerator) within the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. By using software which already exists on most computers and not requiring climatological or modeling knowledge to operate, the method herein for creating WEPP climate input files is fast and simple, requiring as little as 15 minutes. At the first site, analysis of a small (6.7 acre, 2.71 ha) field site monitored as part of the USDA-ARS Conservation Effects Assessment Project in NE Indiana was conducted to determine the effect of climate change on agricultural resources. Precipitation, runoff, soil erosion, and crop growth were modeled using WEPP and the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios used with the CMIP5 model family from the IPCC 5AR to determine the effectiveness of common agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) under predicted climate change. Although precipitation is predicted here to increase by 2100, sediment loss and runoff will decrease due to a reduction of concrete frost conditions during late winter. However, an increase in the amount of precipitation falling in spring and earlier soybean senescence was predicted to lead to increased soil loss in early spring and fall. At the second site, a small agricultural hillslope managed by the USDA-ARS in the Southern Coastal Plain of the United States was modeled using WEPP under current and future climates to assess the effect of predicted future climate change on soil erosion, runoff, and BMP effectiveness. Future climate data was similar to that used at the first site. Predicted climatic shift caused soil loss and runoff to be reduced in the first three months of the year, while late fall and early winter months had increases in predicted soil loss and runoff. Increased temperatures were predicted to cause winter cover crops to grow faster, unhindered by frost in winter. Soil loss increased when cotton senesced earlier under warmer temperatures. Early season water deficits and higher evapotranspiration also increased irrigation demands in the growing season. The combination of no-till, rye cover crop, and riparian buffer increased in effectiveness into the future, while all other management systems had either similar or slightly reduced effectiveness under predicted future climate. At the third site, the Blackwood Creek watershed, a tributary of Lake Tahoe in California, was assessed for potential changes in climate and fire risk under 21st century climates projected by the IPCC AR5. While total precipitation varied by decade, the portion of precipitation falling as snow decreased by as much as 26%, and projected air temperatures increased by as much as 3.4°C by 2090. Total soil water (TSW) predictions by WEPP indicated that fire ignition in the Sierra Nevada region from 1984-2013 coincided with simulated minimum TSW. Risk categories based on simulated TSW changed under projected future climate, with an increase in the number of high risk days defined by TSWs less than 40 mm. Simulated TSW in the Blackwood Creek watershed at the time of historic fires in the region also indicated that the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) was correlated to TSW (R 2 = 0.59) when KBDI was less than 500.

AB  - The objectives of these studies were: (1) to develop a method for pan trapping bees in highbush blueberry (Ericaceae: Vaccinium corymbosum L.); (2) to describe the structure of the endemic bee community associated with blueberry and determine to what extent wild bees contribute to its pollination; (3) to examine the relationship between wild bee community structure and both local habitat features and pest management practices; (4) to evaluate native perennial plants for attracting bees; and (5) to examine blueberry bee community structure in the context of landscape spatial scales. Pan traps elevated in the canopy of flowering blueberry collected more bees than traps placed on the ground or above the canopy. This method was used at 15 blueberry farms in southwest Michigan to characterize the bee community present prior, during, and after blueberry bloom for three years (2004-6). Honey bees, primarily from rented hives, comprised 50-66% of all the bees captured in pan traps each year during bloom. The remainder were wild bees, mainly soil nesting bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae. Andrena carolina , a solitary bee that is oligolectic on Ericaceae, was the most abundant species captured in pan traps during bloom (14%). Bees collected while foraging (n = 22 species) and pollen carried by bees in pan traps (n = 126 specimens) were used to confirm which bees were foraging on blueberry. In pan trap samples during bloom, there was high species turnover from year to year with 79 species recorded on average each year out of a total of 120 species over the three years. Wild bees were more often captured in traps at the field edge than in the interior. In simple linear regressions (SLR) of bees and field characteristics, bee species richness increased with flowering plant species in 2005, and declined with the local frequency of adjacent blueberry fields. Bee diversity (H') was also lower in fields with more nearby blueberry fields. Native bee abundance and richness in 2004 along with bee diversity in 2005 declined with increasing insecticide program toxicity (IPT). In a redundancy analysis of the same characters, IPT explained the greatest amount of variation in the bee species data in 2004, and vegetation attributes explained variation in the species in 2005 and 2006. Of the 43 native perennial plants that were evaluated, all but 2 were visited at least once by no- Apis bees (n = 1393), but there were 9 that were visited most frequently. Floral area explained 33% of the bee diversity at particular plant species. The response of wild bees to the proportion of different landscape types around blueberry fields was evaluated at 5 nested scales using 250, 500, 750, 1000, and 1500 m radius circles. Forest margins (<10 m from the forest edge), human settlement, annual cropland, and blueberry plantations were the most abundant landscape types at each of the spatial scales. Total bee abundance, richness, and diversity did not vary significantly with any of 6 categories of land use at any of the spatial scales, however, A. carolina responded to the proportion of human settlement at the 1500 m scale, and Ceratina calcarata/dupla responded to the proportion of blueberry plantations and semi-natural habitat at the 250 m scale. Three of 4 blueberry fruit yield attributes increased with the proportion of blueberry habitat and decreased with the proportion of semi-natural habitat within 500 m of the focal field. Implications for the conservation of native bees and their importance in blueberry pollination are discussed.

AB  - Natural and re-established riparian buffers reduce nonpoint-source pollutants derived from upland agricultural lands and enhance terrestrial and aquatic habitat. This study was conducted in multi-species riparian buffers, cool-season grass buffers and adjacent crop fields to determine biomass, carbon, nitrogen and soil respiration dynamics. The multispecies buffers were composed of poplar ( Populus × euroamericana' Eugenei ) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Crop fields were under annual corn-soybean rotation. Aboveground biomass was determined by clipping grasses in 25 x 25 cm quadrats. The dynamics of fine (0-2 mm) and small roots (2-5 mm) were assessed by sequentially collecting 5.4 cm diameter, 35 cm deep cores for the first year and 125 cm deep cores for the second year from April through November. Coarse roots were described by excavating 1 x 1 x 2 in pits and collecting all roots in 20 cm depth increments. Root distributions within the soil profile were determined by counting roots that intersected the walls of the excavated pits. Soil respiration was measured monthly from July 1996 to July 1998 using the soda-lime technique. Over the sampling period, live fine-root biomass and root C and N in the riparian buffers were significantly higher than in the crop fields. Poplar had the greatest aboveground live biomass and N and C, while switchgrass had highest aboveground dead biomass, C and N. Roots of trees, cool-season grasses, and switchgrass extended to more than 1.5 m in depth, with switchgrass roots being more widely distributed in deeper horizons. Root density was significantly greater under switchgrass and cool-season grasses than under corn or soybean. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 min) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001). Abundant fine roots, deep rooting depths, and high soil respiration rates in the multispecies riparian buffer zones suggest that these buffer systems added more organic matter to the soil profile, and therefore provided better conditions for nutrient sequestration within the riparian buffers.

AB  - Considerable seasonal and inter-annual variation in the physical properties and extent of snow cover pose problems for obtaining reliable estimates of quantities and characteristics of snow cover from both conventional and satellite measurements (Goodison and Walker, 1994; Goita et al. , 2003). In spite of these challenges, the Climate Research Branch of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) has developed a suite of algorithms to derive snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates from remotely sensed passive microwave imagery (Goodison and Walker, 1994; Derksen et al. , 2002a; Goita et al. , 2003). The MSC algorithms work particularly well over open prairie environments under the assumption of large areas of consistent snow cover (Derksen et al. , 2002a). While studies have documented underestimation in passive microwave estimates of snow extent in marginal areas when compared to optical satellite data (Derksen et al. , 2003b), the accuracy in SWE retrievals under variable and patchy snow conditions is not well understood. In an effort to better understand how a variable and patchy snow cover impacts remotely sensed SWE retrievals, field-based experiments were conducted over patchy snow covered areas in February 2005 and March 2008. A systematic sampling strategy was developed over a 1600 square kilometre (km 2 ) area in southern Saskatchewan near a calibration/validation flight line used for algorithm development in the 1980s (Goodison and Walker, 1994). Land covers found at the sampling sites included fallow and stubble fields, pastures and shelter belts. A large number of sampling sites contained snow pack layers that included one or more ice lenses. This research verifies that the continuous snow cover assumption embedded in the MSC passive microwave SWE algorithm does not produce acceptable results over a patchy snow cover. Several in-situ observations that appear to play an important role in affecting the satellite passive microwave data over a variable snow cover include the presence or absence of an ice lens, the fractional snow covered area, snow depth and the ground temperature. In an attempt to mitigate the impact of fractional snow cover on snow water equivalent estimates, a weighted algorithm is proposed that applies the percentage of snow cover over a remotely sensed footprint to the SWE estimate derived by the MSC algorithm.

AB  - The use of shelterbelts (trees and shrubs) arranged in strategic designs near and within swine facilities potentially can play a significant incremental role in bio-physically mitigating odor in a socio-economically responsible way thereby reducing social conflict from odor nuisance. Shelterbelts of modest heights (i.e. 20-30 ft) may be ideal for plume interception, disruption, and dilution. Based on available evidence, there are five primary ways that shelterbelts can mitigate livestock odors: (1) Physical interception and capture of odor laden dust by trees/shrubs; (2) Dilution of gas concentrations of odor into the lower atmosphere; (3) Ground deposition of odor laden dust due to reduced wind speeds; (4) Providing a biological sink for the chemical constituents of odor after interception; and (5) Enhancing the aesthetics of pork production sites and rural landscapes. Calculated costs for shelterbelt establishment and maintenance over a twenty-year period for four model pork-finishing farms when considering a "seedling price scenario" ($0.50 tree/shrub) are below producer willingness to pay (WTP) for odor mitigation detailed by the USDA. Some "high priced scenarios" ([approximate]$9.59 tree/shrub) exceeded the WTP for producers of certain sizes. Yet, when cost-share programs (e.g. EQIP and CRP) are factored in, the total amortized costs are lowered below all WTP thresholds. Some of the results show positive cost margins (as much as $0.33-$0.59 per pig produced of extra costs to spare) to suggest room for shelterbelts to be part of a "suite of odor management technology". A series of focus groups examined the notion that environmental quality may be marketed by way of producing and labeling as such, "environmentally friendly" pork. The analysis also examines pork producer and consumer interest in the use of shelterbelts as an environmental quality enhancing technology. Pork producers and consumers alike expressed skepticism about the marketability of "odor reduction", suggesting such attributes may better be bundled with other credence type attributes (i.e. animal welfare, locally grown). If consumer's pay for environmental protection by way of a premium for pork products produced with more pollution control then the "traceability" to the producer must be transparent. Producers must benefit directly from such premiums.

AB  - The ability of riparian buffers to filter undesirable nutrients from upland sources has long been recognized as an important ecosystem service for maintaining or improving water quality, and as a result, many land management strategies have been built around the preservation or restoration of buffer zones. Newly derived flow-path metrics have shown great promise as a way to assess riparian buffer function at the watershed scale but a thorough investigation of metric performance was necessary. The goals of this study were to: (1) test the independence of flow-path metrics from traditional metrics using a spatially extensive, independent sample of watersheds, (2) evaluate the effects of stream map resolution on riparian characterization and the ability to predict nitrate discharges, and (3) explore whether nutrient retention estimates may improve the performance of flow-path metrics. The results of this study validated initial findings that flow-path metrics provided more flexible, detailed, and independent measures of land cover patterns compared to traditional methods. Buffer characterization by flow-path metrics was affected by stream map resolution, as were models using metrics to relate nitrate discharge to watershed land cover patterns. Retention-informed metrics showed promise in improving the ability to relate nitrate-nitrogen discharges to measures of riparian function, especially in certain physiographic contexts. A thorough understanding of flow-path metrics and how they are affected by sampling regime, stream map resolution, and estimates of retention is necessary toward the development of a tool useful to land use managers.

AB  - The costs and need for clean water are increasing for greenhouse, nursery, and agricultural businesses. Runoff from irrigated agriculture and specialty crops also can take a toll on the surrounding environment, because irrigation runoff water can contain high amounts of nutrients, contaminants, and plant pathogens. To assuage the pollution contributed to runoff water and reduce the overall volume of water used, nurseries are starting to reuse irrigation runoff water. For this to be possible, the water first should be treated before reuse. Constructed wetlands are a biological treatment option that employs vegetation to collect, filter, and store runoff water. Some wetland plants may have the ability to filter pathogen propagules from runoff without becoming infected and then becoming sources of pathogen inoculum. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of three wetland plants in the genus Canna. ( C. flaccida, C. × generalis `Carolina Pink, and C. × generalis `Bird of Paradise') to five species of Phytophthora (P. cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, P. cryptogea, P. nicotianae, and P. palmivora ) that have been found in irrigation runoff water at ornamental plant nurseries. Plants were grown in Milli-Q water was amended with fertilizer and exposed to three isolates of a single species of Phytophthora. Six plants were exposed to one species of Phytophthora for each of the five species. Six plants were also grown but were not exposed to any species of Phytophthora. Zoospore presence and activity was monitored over the course of 28 days with leaf baits, and the infestation and infection of plant roots were evaluated at the end of each experiment. Roots from every Carolina Pink plant exposed to zoospores were infested, and 75% of the plants were infected. The leaf bait results for Carolina Pink plants indicated that zoospore activity did not decline during the 28 days in the presence of plants. Canna flaccida was less susceptible; 76% of the exposed plants were infested but only 23% were infected. The Bird of Paradise plants were even less susceptible to colonization by species of Phytophthora : only 33% of exposed plants were infested and 15% were infected. There was also a decline in leaf bait colonization in the presence of both Canna flaccida and Bird of Paradise plants when compared to treatment sets that contained Phytophthora only, even after plants were re-exposed to zoospores at day 14. Phytophthora cinnamomi was most successful at colonizing species of Canna plants, regardless of species or cultivar. The Carolina Pink cultivar cannot be recommended for use in constructed wetlands or vegetative buffers, because it was highly susceptible to species of Phytophthora and could potentially contribute to inoculum loads in recycled irrigation water. Canna flaccida and Bird of Paradise plants could be utilized in vegetative buffers, as they are less susceptible and seemed to help filter inocula from runoff water, as evidenced by decreased zoospore activity over time.

AB  - Conservation and environmental needs require accurate prediction of the water and sediment movement and discharge from agricultural fields and catchments. Predictive models are being developed that describe dynamic watershed processes. In this study, dynamic factors that govern the water and sediment response of an agricultural catchment were related to antecedent runoff, crop management, and tillage conditions by simulation and watershed data. A revised version of the SEDLAB (USDA-ARS Sedimentation Laboratory) model was developed to simulate hydrologic and sediment responses and tested with data from small agricultural watersheds in Southwestern Iowa. Model modifications were required to improve the accuracy of the flow hydraulics, soil detachment and sediment transport of grass waterways. New methods were developed to represent overland and channel flow resistance which accounts for the effects of antecedent runoff, tillage, crop, and vegetation of each event. A new equation was developed for sediment transport capacity through grassed waterways as a function of flow sediment and vegetative properties. Dynamic variables were included for hydrologic, crop, and tillage effects on soil erosion to account for event-to-event variation. Model modifications were tested with measured data of selected events on USDA Watersheds 1 and 2 near Treynor, Iowa. Infiltration and flow resistance parameters were calibrated for each of 28 selected events. Experimental plot and watershed sediment data were used to calibrate the respective soil detachment and channel sediment transport equations. Supplemental records and observations during the 13 data years were used to define the watershed conditions for each event. Good predictions of the water discharge were obtained for most of the storms, but only by individual event calibration. Additional improvements in the infiltration equations are needed to define the effects of hydrology, soils, tillage, and crops. Very good agreement was obtained between measured and computed sediment responses for most of the study events, although continued research is needed to refine methods which describe soil detachment and sediment transport mechanisms.

AB  - Coastal increases in population have generally resulted in conversion of forested lands to sprawling urban development. The impervious cover (e.g., roads, rooftops, driveways) that accompanies urban development leads to increases in the volume of stormwater and subsequent contributions of non-point source pollution to coastal water bodies (e.g., tidal creeks). State and local agencies have developed regulations to reduce the impact of stormwater and non-point source pollution on receiving waters through the use of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs). The curve number (CN) method is oftentimes used to estimate runoff from the 2- and 10-year design event which informs the size and design criteria of stormwater BMPs. Stormwater detention ponds are the most common BMP used along the South Carolina coast; however regional research suggests that limitations exist in their ability to address non-point source pollution. Low Impact Development (LID) practices (e.g., bioretention swales, pervious pavers, rainwater harvesting) have been suggested as a means for addressing stormwater quality yet their prevalence is limited along the coastal zone of the southeast. A study was conducted to identify the obstacles to the implementation of LID practices, define a method for evaluating their comparative performance at the catchment scale, and to evaluate their ability to retain stormwater and its associated pollutants regionally. Interviews of stormwater professionals indicated that the educational needs of stakeholders (27 % of responses) and the regulatory process (22 % of responses) are the primary obstacles to regional implementation of LID practices. Participants suggested that the creation of guidelines for the design, permitting, and maintenance of LID practices would assist in overcoming these obstacles. The CN method provided a reasonably accurate estimate of runoff volume from the LID catchment over a small range of rainfall depths and intensities; 14.0 mm to 43.7 mm and 1.2 mm hr -1 to 7.6 mm hr-1 , respectively. However, the CN method was not capable of estimating the volume of runoff produced from a high intensity rain event (13.7 mm hr-1 ) since the method does not include a temporal variant (e.g. rain over time). The LID practices at Oak Terrace Preserve reduced the concentrations of FC and TSS in the first portion of the runoff hydrograph (defined as the first 13 millimeters of rainfall) compared to subsequent portions of runoff. However, these lower concentrations did not translate into a difference in FC and TSS yields between the two catchments. Regulatory agencies were apprehensive of limited soil storage capacity and recommended the use of underdrains beneath the LID practices to prevent long-term ponding of stormwater. These underdrains quickly conveyed stormwater and associated pollutants offsite resulting in no difference in the volume of runoff or pollutant masses when compared to a curb-and-gutter system. In addition, seasonal contributions of pesticide runoff highlighted the over-riding impact of pollutant contributions from catchment residents. Although BMPs have been shown to be effective at reducing stormwater peak flows and retaining particulate pollutant masses at the site scale, studies suggest that these impacts do not necessarily translate to mitigation at the watershed scale. This study highlighted the sensitivity of stormwater BMPs to design and suggests that we can no longer depend on an engineered solution to the ecological impacts of sprawling coastal development. Instead there is a need to be more thoughtful and strategic in the development of our coasts through greater land planning efforts to minimize impervious cover and maximize the conservation of open space and riparian buffers in coastal watersheds. Since coastal development cannot be prevented all together, stormwater management will remain an integral component to mitigating the impact of coastal development. Future Southeast coastal stormwater management programs should provide a compre ensive stormwater management strategy to promote: peak flow reduction through temporary stormwater retention, water quality enhancement by promoting pollutant filtration, sorption, settling, transformation, decay, and uptake, and the reduction of stormwater volume and pollutant loads at the source. LID practices provide an option for addressing water quality enhancements, but regionally relevant design guidelines and models should be developed and provided to engineers, developers, and regulatory agencies to assure their appropriate application. In addition, education and incentive programs should be incorporated into stormwater management programs to reduce pollutant loadings at the source.

AB  - <p class=Abstract>Kenya contains 26 natural habitat fragments and only 3% of forest cover across five main forest blocks. These blocks form the main water towers in semi-arid Kenya on which people and wildlife, far beyond the protected boundaries, depend. Mount Kenya (MK) is the largest forest block, and the protection of its water catchment function is of national importance (Chapter 2).</p> <p class=Abstract>The five forest blocks in Kenya hold almost one third of the total of 28,806 elephants in Kenya, of which MK was estimated as having the largest highland elephant population with 2,911 (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>±</span>640) individuals in 2001 (Chapter 3). Elephant estimates in forest are usually derived from dung count surveys, which are prone to bias and accordingly most often classed as C or D, in the range from A (best) to E (worst), in the African Elephant Database (AED). The MK elephant estimate described in this thesis was one of only two dung count estimates that were classed as quality B in the AED of 2002 (Chapter 3). Explanatory models based on the dung count data were integrated with a geographic information system (GIS) to develop the most advanced predictive seasonal distribution maps currently available for elephants in a forested environment (Chapter 4). Furthermore, least-cost elephant travel routes and foraging paths were digitally traced over cost surface images, developed from data on preferred elephant habitats in different seasons, physical barriers such as extreme slopes, and land use barriers such as farmland (Chapter 5). This enabled the location of elephant movements in relation to plantations inside the MK forest, and investigation of the relationship between measured tree damage in plantations and elephant movements (Chapter 5). Two areas where subsequently identified where elephant routes strayed from the forest into adjacent farmland, which was where most elephant crop damage was reported by farmers to Kenya Wildlife Service stations and outposts (Chapter 6). Elephants and people trespassing on each other¿s habitats is pronounced because MK is surrounded by a ring of small-scale farmers, totalling over 500,000 people living within 5,000m of the MK forest boundary on farms of 1.6ha on average (Chapter 6).</p>

AB  - Atta cephalotes L., the predominant leaf-cutting ant species found in coffee farms in the Turrialba region of Costa Rica, is considered a pest of the crop because it removes coffee foliage. I applied agroecosystem and landscape level perspectives to study A. cephalotes foraging, colony distribution and dynamics in coffee agroecosystems in the Turrialba region. I also conducted field assays to assess effects of control methods on colonies of different sizes and to examine the efficacy of alternatives to insecticides. Colony density (number of colonies/ha) and foraging of A. cephalotes were studied in different coffee agroecosystems, ranging from monoculture to highly diversified systems, and with either conventional or organic inputs. A. cephalotes colony density was higher in monocultures compared to more diversified coffee systems. The percentage of shade within the farm was directly related to A. cephalotes colony density. The proportion of coffee plant tissue being collected by A. cephalotes was highest in monocultures and lowest in farms with complex shade (more than three shade tree species present). Number of colonies and total surface area of colonies were greater near the edges of coffee farms than closer to the interior (>30 m from edge). This effect was significantly stronger for edges adjacent to riparian forest strips than other edge types. There was only limited evidence of the influence of landscape features at greater distances from farms (up to 2000 m) on within-farm colony densities. Sulfluramid and sodium octoborate caused the greatest mortality among 9 treatments tested in bait formulations on A. cephalotes colony activity and mortality. One of the alternative baits tested (active ingredient, propagules of Paecilomyces sp. 0484) caused significant reduction in colony activity (worker movements into and out of nest openings), but failed to cause significant colony mortality. Effects of treatments on colony activity were stronger on large (>30 m2 of nest surface area) than on medium (1.1-30 m2 ) and small colonies 0.03-1 m2 . Coffee farmers would benefit from reduced attack by A. cephalotes by increasing the amount of shade, planting shade species palatable to A. cephalotes but economically unimportant or capable of withstanding ant attacks.

AB  - The receptive fields of peripheral afferent fibers have been studied using a new tactile stimulator with multiple, independently controlled probes. The tactile stimulator comprises seven linear motors that drive seven probes (0.5 mm diam) arranged in a hexagonal rosette (1.0 mm spacings), which is embedded within a large hexagonal array of static probes. The entire array is mounted on a three-axis translation stage allowing movement to different receptive field sites. Single and multiple probe combinations were used to map the receptive field and study responses to stimuli of increasing spatial complexity. The receptive fields of RA and SAI afferents vary in shape but are generally round or oval with eccentric hot spots and field borders that are very sharp. Both types show variability in sensitivity across their receptive field. RA field size is more sensitive to indentation magnitude than is SAI field size; at the greater intensities the RA field sizes are considerably larger than SAI field sizes. Neither the response magnitudes nor the spatial structure of the receptive fields were affected by the baseline indentation, of the entire array which suggests that the responses of primary afferents depend on relative rather than absolute indentation magnitudes. In both afferent types, responses to two probes presented simultaneously evoked fewer impulses than the maximum response to either of the probes presented alone. Further, the evoked response declines monotonically with increasing numbers of active probes. At the hot spot the numbers of action potentials evoked by seven probes are 27% (SAI's) and 47% (RA's) of the numbers evoked by a single probe. The most probable mechanism for the peripheral attenuation is based on skin mechanics as additional probes relieve the strain at the hot spot. Differences between RA and SAI are consistent with the proposition that the SAI population is responsible for representation of spatial form.

AB  - Knowledge on spatial patterns of insect pest populations and the ecological processes influencing these patterns can be directly applied to the management of pests in agricultural systems. Recent increases in stink bug populations, importantly the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stål 1855), has caused unprecedented economic losses in the mid-Atlantic United States. To inform integrated pest management programs, I quantified the spatial heterogeneity of stink bug population density in field crops at multiple spatial scales (field edge, entire fields and regional), and identified the associated environmental factors and the underlying ecological mechanisms (i.e. climatic tolerances, resource quality and availability). At corn and soybean field edges, highest density of stink bugs was limited to the first few crop rows. At some study sites, fields adjacent to woods and buildings harbored higher density of stink bugs than those adjacent to open areas. Injury to corn kernel damage, and soybean pod and seed increased with stink bug density, and was highest at the field edges. Stink bug density was also positively associated with yield loss in soybean. In entire fields of corn-soybean, H. halys was found in very low density or absent beyond 25m from the field edge. At study sites with high stink bug populations, interpolated density values showed potential dispersal of H. halys, particularly adults and large nymphs, from corn into soybean, coinciding with the end of dough stage in corn and beginning of soybean seed development stage. Temperature and developed areas, and proportion of forest and crop areas were important predictors of regional patterns in H. halys and Chinavis hilaris abundance, respectively. For Euschistus servus, temperature and forest cover influenced patterns at broad spatial scale. Adjacent habitat influence, with highest abundance along woods, on stink bug density was limited to within field scale, and difference in abundance between sites was driven primarily by temperature gradient. These results directly inform field level stink bug management strategies through planting date and orientation of fields in the landscape, and for timing and intensity of treatments, as well as area-wide management. This research also identified roles of temperature and landscape in facilitating or impeding invasive pest populations.

AB  - Non-point source pollution is a landscape scale phenomenon and its diffuse nature complicates mitigation efforts. One response to this has been the use of vegetative filter zones (VFZ) at the point of origin of the pollution (i.e. where water leaves agricultural fields, feedlots and barnyards) or, more commonly, at the point of entry of NPSP into surface waters (i.e. wetlands and riparian areas). The studies presented in this dissertation examined surface and subsurface processes that accounted for nitrogen pollutant removal in forested filter zones (FFZ) where runoff was artificially dispersed on two agricultural watersheds in Oxford, N.C. Surface processes were studied by constructing nitrogen budgets for the surface 30 cm of each FFZ. Subsurface processes were studied by measuring changes in groundwater chemistry along transects from the field edges to the forest edge and below the FFZ1. Two additional experiments were conducted whereby nitrate and a conservative tracer, bromide, were introduced into the soil profile at different depths and attenuation was measured by intercepting the solute plume at different distances form the point of introduction. A laboratory incubation was conducted to determine the effect of short-term (1 to 2 years) exposure of FFZ soils to nutrient laden runoff on denitrification potential and denitrification rates at different depths in the soil profile. Results indicated that infiltration was essential for removal of nitrogen pollutants from surface runoff. The major N influxes through surface runoff from the agricultural fields occurred during the spring. During this period, leaching losses were low due to the presence of a high water table. Nitrogen retained by the FFZ during this period was taken up by the vegetation. Denitrification was the primary process that accounted for nitrate removal from subsurface water. The efficiency of nitrate removal via denitrification was closely associated with dissolved organic carbon. Dispersal of agricultural runoff enhanced denitrification potential within the FFZ, suggesting that this practice had a favorable effect on the soil microbial population. This did not translate to enhanced denitrification under ambient carbon conditions where nitrate reduction in subsoils was higher in soil samples from areas that did not receive agricultural effluent, suggesting that changes in the nature of the organic carbon may also have occurred. FFZ that are designed for the removal of N species from surface runoff should not be located on sites where seepage is present during the winter and spring because this prohibits infiltration and removal of dissolved N species, particularly nitrate, from runoff. In addition, these sites may become net contributors to nitrate in runoff. In subsurface drainage, carbon is the essential determining element for the effectiveness of VFZ in nitrate removal. Forest lands, particularly forested riparian areas, by nature of their deeper root systems than herbaceous vegetation, will have greater available carbon deeper in the soil profile and will be more effective at nitrate removal.

AB  - I focused my research on urban riparian forests within Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. My goals are to understand the impacts of exotic species invasion on these forest communities, identify factors that make these sites susceptible to invasion, and make appropriate restoration recommendations. First, I tested two major paradigms of current exotic species ecology using observational data from 23 urban riparian buffers. The competition paradigm was borne out by negative relationships between exotic and native species richness (r = -0.66, p = 0.0009). I also detected shifts in species composition away from native woody species in sites that have been invaded by exotic species. My second approach involved conducting an experimental removal study at the North Carolina Museum of Art. I compared the species composition and native species recovery in three treatments: control, initially removing all vegetation and allowing regeneration, and initial removal with repeated removal of new exotic recruits. These results indicate that repeated removal is necessary to prevent invasion in urban forests but that native supplemental plantings may be necessary to create a diverse community. My third approach involved evaluating the influence of landscape structure on patterns of exotic species invasion in urban riparian buffers. These findings suggest that processes outside the buffer, such as bird dispersal and vegetative spreading of ornamental plantings, may contribute to the invasion inside the buffer. Exotic species invasion does have implications for restoration of urban forests. Because these forests are invaded by a suite of exotic plants, targeted efforts to remove those that are likely outcompeting native species is a good first step. Managing land use practices outside of the forests, while difficult, is necessary to reduce both the stress on the forest (e.g., fertilization) and invasion opportunities (e.g., bird dispersal, ornamental plantings).

AB  - A three-year study was conducted to determine the effect of rye ( Secale cereale L.), switchgrass (Paspalum viragtum L.), and switchgrass plus forb strips on the abundance of selected arthropods in southeastern Missouri cotton fields at Clarkton and Portageville. The study site at Portageville was irrigated, but the one at Clarkton lacked irrigation. Vegetative strip plots contained a four-row wide vegetative strip and 24 rows of cotton plants on either side of the strip, and were compared to insecticide-treated and insecticide-free conventional plots (cotton stands without vegetative strips). Plots were separated by 12 m-wide alleys and replications were separated by 4.5 m-wide alleys. Alleys were kept free of weeds and cotton using cultivation practices and herbicide applications. Research emphasis was placed on thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and other selected pests and beneficial arthropods. Species were given attention based on their potential to influence cotton yield or pest population levels. Arthropod samples were collected at 1, 6, and 12 m from both sides of the vegetative strips, and from the four center rows of the two conventional cotton treatments. Population densities of thrips species Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), Thrips tabaci Lindeman, Limothrips cerealium (Haliday), and Neohydatothrips variabilis (Beach) on cotton seedlings were not significantly affected by the use of vegetative strips. However, thrips population densities were reduced to below economic levels by in-furrow applications of aldicarb at planting. The ant species Pheidole bicarinata Mayr, P. vindendalica Forel, and P. morrisi Forel were more abundant in cotton fields containing vegetative strips than in those without vegetative strips at Portageville, but at Clarkton, ants were equally abundant among treatments. Ant abundance was greater at 1 m than at 12 m from the strips at both sites. Greater numbers of tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae), ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and spiders (Araneae) occurred at 1 m than at 6 or 12 m from the strips. No significant differences in numbers of boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman; the bollworm complex, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Heliothis virescens (F.); and cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover occurred regardless of treatment. This study suggests that planting switchgrass, switchgrass-forb, or rye strips in erosion-prone cotton fields in southeastern Missouri should have little or no impact on standard pest management practices and may protect ant colonies and attract beneficial arthropods. Therefore, planting these strips in cotton fields for wind erosion control should be encouraged.

AB  - Soil properties were evaluated under three land use practices on sloping land on Kolombangara in Solomon Islands (lat. 5-12°S and long. 155-170°W). The land use practices include: (1) natural forest (NF), (2) current farmers shifting cultivation practice (FP), and (3) current farmers practice with topsoil removed or scalped (SC). Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, texture, and aggregation were significantly impacted by cultivation and topsoil removal. Soil organic carbon content (SOC) was significantly low under the FP and SC treatments compared to NF treatment. The NF treatment had 2.8 times more SOC than FP treatment and 9.6 times more than SC treatment in the top 15cm. depth. In the 15-30 cm depth, the SOC content in NF was 1.7 times more than FP and 6 times more than SC. High SOC content was only found in the topsoil (0-15 cm. depth) and decreases abruptly with depth among all three treatments. The data also showed that the changes in the soil chemical properties had significant effect on the sweet potato yield compared to soil physical properties. Sweet potato yield was low for the SC treatment, which had significant reductions in SOC, N, P, K and CEC. After two sweet potato crops under the current farmers practice, yield was drastically reduced along with changes in soil chemical properties. Changes in soil properties impacts soil quality which made the current farmers practice unsustainable without high input. Three types of vegetative barriers were evaluated against traditional farmer's practice (FP) for their potential to reduce runoff on a 35 percent slope from February 1999 to April 2000. Runoff amount was strongly correlated with daily rainfall amount (r 2 = 0.76) and occurred in daily rainfall events exceeding 20mm. There was no significant difference in runoff between different vegetative barriers and FP which, suggest vegetative barriers used had little effect on runoff. Total runoff amount during the 15 month period for the four different treatments were 67.6 mm. for FP, and 82.7 mm, 97.2mm, 76.2mm for banana ( Musa nana )/heliconia ( Heliconia bihai ), pineapple Ananas comosis and western cabbage (Polycias gradiflora ) vegetative barriers respectively. Since the runoff amounts were low, infiltration was high which can result in high nutrient leaching. Ground cover from the sweet potato vines was had a positive effect in controlling runoff especially around 2 to 3 months after planting when the ground cover was 75 to 100 percent.

AB  - Increasing population and conflicts over water use have focused attention on the need for watershed planning in Metro Atlanta. This thesis is divided into a set of nested projects matching the ecosystem scale of smaller watersheds feeding into larger ones with the human scale of small neighborhoods forming larger communities and cities. A biological survey of Peavine and South Peachtree Creeks shows that the health of the streams is declining. A paired watershed study of two small tributaries of Peavine Creek; one in old-growth Fernbank Forest, and the other in an adjacent, same-size, developed watershed with a riparian buffer of old-growth forest, reveals that stormwater runoff is the main cause of stream impairment. Solutions are presented to restore stream ecosystem function and improve the livability of neighborhoods through watershed protection. The Peavine Creek watershed with its old-growth forest and historic neighborhoods is proposed as a demonstration site for community-based watershed protection.

AB  - The six most abundant carabid species occurring in cereal fields in central Sweden were the focus of this study. The adult-overwinterers Bembidion lampros Herbst and Pterostichus cupreus L. had distributions confined to the fields and their edges, whereas the larval-overwinterers Trechus secalis Paykull, P. melanarius Illiger and P. niger Schaller were also common in uncultivated habitats adjacent to the fields. Individuals of these larval-overwintering species moved out of the fields during summer. The adult-overwinterers migrated seasonally between the fields and hibernation sites along the field edges. Harpalus rufipes DeGeer showed a similar distribution to that obtained for the adult-overwinterers. Habitat choice experiments revealed that B. lampros, P. cupreus and H. rufipes preferred fields, while T. secalis and P. melanarius preferred woods, as did the forest-species Carabus nemoralis Muller. P. niger did not show a preference for either habitat. Habitat preferences in these beetles are apparently governed primarily by species-specific microclimatic requirements. P. melanarius, P. niger and H. rufipes individuals were traced in the field, using portable radar system (harmonic radar). P. niger showed the most rapid movements. A combination of characteristics regarding mandible wear and reproductive condition were used to estimate the age in the medium-sized beetles. Thus, in P. cupreus, mainly 1-year-olds reproduced, whereas in the larval-overwinterers most reproduction occurred during the second adult year. Mandible wear differed between species owing to differences in burrowing behaviour. Consumption of hard food increased mandible wear significantly, as shown in experiments with P. melanarius. The cereal fields and their edges were used for oviposition and larval development by all species studied.

AB  - Conservation plantings of native wildflowers were established alongside blueberry fields to test the hypothesis that provision of resources for natural enemies and bees increases their abundance in adjacent crop fields. For two growing seasons (2007 and 2008), at four commercial blueberry farms, fields with flowering field borders were compared to control fields where growers maintained field borders of mown grass. In both years, this revealed contrasting effects of the presence of flowering plants on representative groups of natural enemies, pests, and pollinators. Natural enemies, wild bees, and some pests were consistently more abundant in fields adjacent to flower plantings. A laboratory evaluation was also performed to compare the longevity of three different commercially available natural enemies: a lady beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinelidae: Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville), a predatory bug (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae: Orius insidiosus (Say)), and a generalist aphid parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidius colemani Viereck), caged with cut flowers from the border plantings. Natural enemies exhibited a variable pattern of sensitivity to provision of flowers, with A. colemani being the most sensitive, O. insidiosus intermediate, and H. convergens being relatively insensitive to flower availability.

AB  - Agroforestry is a relative ideal land management for landuse and development in mountain and hill regions. Selected Vetiveria zizanioides and Amorjdia Jruticosa as hedgerows, and inter-cropped wheat and soybean, and took full inter-cropping web isolating clapboard and fertilization as treatments, the study utilized large pots to simulate agroforestry in slope land. The project studied impacts of hedgerows on crop growth and nutrient absorption through isotopic tracer technique and observations on biomass of hedgerows and crops, crops yield, and nutrient absorption of crops. Conclusions could be draw as following. Approaches of hedgerow affecting crop growth have been studied. The effect of aboveground of Vetiveria zizanioides on crop growth is stronger than that of belowground. Amorphajruticosa do either. Behaviors of hedgerows on crop growth have been studied. Results showed that both hedgerows have effects on wheat and soybean growth But the effect is weaker than that of wheat itself and is stronger than that of soybean itself Further more, the effect of Vetiveria zizanioides is weaker than that of Amorphafruticosa on crop growth. The competitive abilities of nutrient absorption of hedgerows and crops have been compared. The results of 15N isotopic tracer experiment showed that the flow of N exists between hedgerows and oops, and the ability of Vetiveria zizanioides is beyond that of Amorpha fruticosa and soybean, and the ability of Amorpha fruticosa is above that of soybean. The project illustrated competitive attributes of components of agroforestry basically, which could offer a theoretical foundation for promotion and application of agroforestry.

AB  - A feasibility study of machine vision applications was conducted for agricultural vehicle navigation in open field environments, and focused on solving certain fundamental issues in vision-based agricultural vehicle navigation. Those issues were: (1) camera installation pose automatic calibration; (2) vehicle heading estimation and (3) field edge detection. A stereo color camera was selected to support the research on the three issues. Stereo cameras have been used as perception sensors for agricultural vehicle navigation for years. One problem impeding their broader application is the difficulty of determining the camera's installation pose using conventional measuring tools, especially when they are used in an open-field agricultural environment. To solve this problem, an automated calibration method was developed to determine the camera's installation pose with respect to the vehicle frame. Based on this method, a binocular stereo camera acquired a sequence of images as the vehicle moved straight forward a short distance on relatively even ground. A machine vision algorithm was used to detect static feature points on the ground and track their three-dimensional (3D) motions in relationship to the vehicle. A plane fitting for the ground features was then used to determine the camera roll and pitch, and the tracked motions were used to estimate the camera yaw. The results obtained from the field test validated that this method was capable of determining the camera installation pose automatically in order to achieve a calibration accuracy of ±1° over approximately 10 m of test distance. The calibrated poses could be used to compensate for the navigation errors induced by the misalignment of the camera. An image processing algorithm was developed to investigate the feasibility of using stereovision to estimate the heading direction of a moving vehicle in open agricultural field environments. The algorithm first detected, and then tracked, static natural ground features in every two consecutive images that were taken by a stereo camera mounted on a vehicle while the vehicle was in motion. These static features were used as references to calculate the vehicle's three-dimensional (3D) motion. In the final stage, the vehicle heading direction was estimated using the 3D motion. Working with a series of sequential image frames taken while the vehicle was in motion, the algorithm continuously estimated the vehicle heading direction. Field tests were conducted to evaluate its usability. When the vehicle traveled straight forward, the proposed algorithm worked properly. When the vehicle traveled in an oscillating mode, the algorithm responded properly when the vehicle turned, but with less estimation accuracy than in the straight traveling mode. The field tests showed that it is possible to use stereovision to estimate a moving vehicle's heading direction in an open agricultural field. Field edges are important references for human drivers who steer vehicles in agricultural operations. This research explored the possibility of using machine vision to detect field edges in open field agricultural environments. A detecting algorithm was proposed based on the hue difference between an open field and its grass-covered edge. Field tests showed that the algorithm was capable of distinguishing a relatively clear edge from an open field. However, when the field edge was not clear, the algorithm was unable to identify it due to the existence of noise. This research showed that images with lower resolution were less affected by noise. The same algorithm detected unclear field edges after reducing noise by lowering image resolution. Color change adaptability was also implemented in order to improve the algorithm's robustness. As a result, it was possible to use machine vision to detect the grass covered edges of an open agricultural field. This research proved the feasibility of the machine vision applications in the three targeted problems, and has shown that machine vi ion is capable of navigating agricultural vehicles in open field environments.

AB  - Widespread use of commercial fertilizers in the past and present has created a considerable concern as to their impact on the environment. Nitrate is widely used as fertilizer, easily transformed from nitrogen-bearing chemicals by microorganisms and highly mobile in soils. Because of its ubiquitous sources, nitrate contamination is of particular concern in regards to the quality of streams and rivers in the midwestern United States. Riparian, stream and agroecosystems were studied in sixteen small watersheds (80 sub-basins) located in the Western Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion to determine lotic nitrate dynamics. Seasonal water sampling and associated field assessments were conducted during normal/typical flow conditions from 1992 to 1994. Watershed features including land use/land cover types, soil properties and stream characteristics were identified at sub-basin level using a geographic information system. With respect to water chemistry and watershed features, principle component analysis in conjunction with multiple and logistic regressions were utilized. The results showed that most seasonal variations were explained by stream discharge, turbidity, pH K$\sp+,$ Na$\sp+,$ Mg$\sp{2+}$ and Cl$\sp-.$ The percentage of total cropland in the watershed and soil permeability highly predicted the stressed nitrate condition $(\ge$25 mg L$\sp{-1})$ while the non-stressed condition ($<$25 mg L$\sp{-1})$ was closely related to mid-range soil slope and the presence of riparian forest and waterbody in the 30 m buffer zone. Ordinary kriging was used to predict the spatial similarity and patterns of instream nitrate values in the ecoregion. The spring semivariogram $\rm(R\sp2 = 0.896)$ showed the greatest spatial similarity with a lag distance equal to 130 km due to lofted precipitation and warm, moist and bare soils while the fall semivariogram $\rm(R\sp2 = 0.057)$ exhibited an opposite trend (lag distance = 20 km) as related to limited rainfall, arid soils as well as localized human perturbations. Higher annual mean nitrate concentration was related to an increase in the latitude of streams. The high nitrate values in northern streams appeared to be linked with the extent of field drainage systems in cropland. A long-term and two annual (1992 and 1993) ecosystem models were developed by LISREL (LInear Structural RELations) technique to hypothesize stream structures and functions. All of these models showed that increases in the percentage of total cropland and stream discharge were the prime sources in promoting the amount of nitrate loading exported. A beneficial effect of algae on alleviating the nitrate transport was identified during 1992. However, its effect became insignificant in 1993 due to harsh flow patterns induced by the floods. Forested areas (in particular, 30 m riparian buffer) and streamside forest had a negative effect on flow regime during 1992 and 1993, respectively, suggesting their ability in abating instream transport of nitrate.

AB  - In East Anglia, a high proportion of the land is devoted to arable farming but farming methods are beginning to change due to economic problems. Distribution maps show this area to be species rich for terrestrial snails despite the fact that current farming methods severely limit snail numbers within a field. One particular species, Monacha cantiana, is both abundant and increasing over much of eastern England. In the absence of available data, research was undertaken to establish the current distribution of M. cantiana in arable field margins of the Debden Valley of East Anglia and he change in distribution of this species following a change in use of land adjacent to such field margins. M. cantiana abundance was higher in ditch field margins, alongside cropped fields, on chalk or sandy soil and lower on clay soil, in flat field margins and alongside wood or grassland. Live macro-snail abundance correlated with soil measure, pH and lowest January temperature, adult M. cantiana appearing more susceptible to winter cold than their juveniles. M. cantiana colonised farmland when there was a change of crop from wheat to grassland or to mixed vegetation. However, the community composition varied between sites. Few autumn-born juvenile M. cantiana reached adulthood the following year in newly colonised sites and sites were re-colonised by adult snails. Frequency histograms, which indicated increasing numbers of adult snails over a summer, did not indicate growth of juvenile snails and could therefore be misleading. This observation is significant for many published works in ecology. Ditch field margins appeared to be acting as reservoirs of M. cantiana that are opportunistic colonisers of newly available habitats. Near a typical ditch field margin, an environmental disturbance on adjacent flat land did not unduly affect the subsequent summer abundance and reproductive success of M. cantiana, although distribution across the site altered. Ditch field margin management may therefore be an important factor in M. cantiana survival.

AB  - Grassland bird populations have been declining due to increased habitat fragmentation, urbanization, and conversion of farmlands to other uses throughout the United States. However, idle hayfields and pastures in the eastern United States may provide adequate nesting habitat for grassland species displaced from their native habitat. The objectives of this study were to: (1) compare grassland bird abundance, diversity, and richness of species between 3 idle hayfields and 3 pastures and between mowed and unmowed treatments, and (2) compare grassland bird nest success between hayfields and pastures, and between mowed and unmowed treatments on the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge, West Virginia during the summers of 1999-2000. A total of 27 species was found on the refuge. The predominant grassland species were bobolinks ( Dolichonyz oryzivorus ), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis ), and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna ). Overall bird abundance differed between mowed (x ̄ = 0.61; SE = 0.09) and unmowed (x ̄ = 0.32; SE = 0.06) treatments in pastures (P = 0.033). Grassland bird diversity differed between mowed plots of hayfields (x ̄ = 0.85; SE = 0.21) and pastures (x ̄ = 1.57; SE = 0.26) (P = 0.026). Mayfield nest survival did not differ between nests found in hayfields and pastures, and mowed and unmowed treatments. While nest success did not differ between mowed and unmowed treatments, mowing these fields at the conclusion of the breeding season will provide long team advantages to grassland birds nesting on the refuge. Additionally, grassland birds appeared to be responding to the vegetative structure and vertical diversity within fields rather than field size. Management should focus on removal of internal edges (i.e., remnant fencelines, hedgerows, and wind breaks) found throughout the grasslands on the refuge.

AB  - Forested riparian buffers (FRB) provide numerous critical ecosystem services. However, the linear and often narrow spatial configuration of FRBs makes it difficult to identify broadscale spatial and temporal change in their characteristics. Remote sensing data are most often used to inventory and characterize FRB conditions. However, the spatial resolution of conventionally used remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat) is often larger than the average FRB corridor width yielding pixels containing mixed land cover types. There is a need to both develop cost effective methods to identify and analyze change in FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration over time and to assess error surrounding these techniques, in support of understanding the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on FRB ecological integrity and ecosystem service provision. This dissertation tests the use of high resolution, discrete return lidar data to quantify FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration within a headwater watershed. It further assesses whether lidar data can be used to identify change in FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration, and to quantify disturbance impacts on FRB systems. The objectives of this dissertation are to 1) assess error associated with leaf-off compared to leaf-on lidar derived estimates of riparian buffer vegetation height and fractional cover within a variety of riparian vegetation types throughout a headwater watershed, 2) to assess the influence of anthropogenic development in the form of "edge effects" on riparian buffer structure at both the corridor / adjacent landuse edge, the stream edge and throughout the buffer corridor and 3) quantify differences in width and fragmentation estimates derived from leaf-on lidar data, leaf-off lidar data and moderate resolution Landsat data within corridors of varying width and adjacent to varying landuse types. Results of this dissertation demonstrate that leaf off lidar derived estimates of vegetation height (H) are similar to leaf-on lidar derived H estimates and further are within 1 - 2 m of field measurements within all vegetation types assessed. Similarly, leaf-off lidar estimates of fractional cover are within 10 - 20 % of measured within mixed and conifer canopies. Leaf-on lidar derived estimates of H and FC are similar to field measures within all canopy types assessed. This dissertation also demonstrates that FRB vegetation is 1) taller within wider buffers adjacent to undeveloped landuse types and 2) taller at the naturally occurring stream edge compared to the matrix edge (the edge / adjacent landuse interface). Throughout the FRB corridor, vegetation fractional cover is consistently high (> 80 % on average, suggesting a consistently closed canopy) regardless of adjacent landuse type or FRB corridor width. This dissertation also demonstrates that both leaf-on and widely available leaf-off lidar can be used to accurately estimate FRB corridor width (with estimate accuracy better than 5 m on average), and degree fragmentation within agricultural, undeveloped and developed landuse types. Landsat derived width estimates may under and overestimate FRB width by 10 - 20 m or more on average, particularly within narrow and developed corridors, significantly influencing ecological assessment. Largest differences between lidar and Landsat width estimates and validation widths (difference > 5 m) are observed within developed types where landcover is more heterogeneous, confounding forest classification and in turn FRB edge detection. Thus, this research demonstrates that lidar can bridge the gap between grain (data resolution), area extent and 3-dimensional analysis of vegetation structure in ecological analysis of FRBs that exists using conventional RS methods. It also demonstrates the use of existing lidar data to map FRB corridor vegetation structure and spatial configuration, which will significantly reduce data collection costs in support of broadscale mapping efforts.

AB  - The efficacy of inter-row vegetative filter strips (VFS) for controlling runoff of the commonly used organo-phosphate insecticide (diazinon) from dormant-sprayed orchards was investigated through physical (microecosystem) and numerical models. The microecosystem consisted of a pesticide sprayer, rainfall simulator and orchard floor model with and without VFS. Diazinon was sprayed at a rate of 2.8 kg/ha within 24 hours prior to rainfall simulation. Rainfall, at an intensity of 50 mm/hr, was simulated for 60 minutes. Experiments were conducted for 0%, 50%, and 100% soil coverage by VFS. Diazinon concentrations in overland flow, interflow and infiltration outflow, and also in soil and vegetation samples were measured. Total diazinon losses from the orchard floor model at the end of rainfall-runoff simulation as applied pesticide mass were 8.6%, 5.8% and 2.3%, respectively for the 0%, 50%, and 100% VFS cover treatments. The microecosystem study indicated that inter-row VFS has potential for reducing diazinon runoff from dormant-sprayed orchards. The principle mechanism of diazinon runoff control in VFS was the diversion of runoff water, the primary pesticide carrier, into interflow and vertical infiltration. Most of the diazinon was trapped on the surface of the VFS and its root zone. A numerical simulation model of Pesticide Runoff through Vegetative Filer Strips (PRVFS) was developed as a tool for investigating effects of the pesticide transport mechanisms on VFS design in the field. The PRVFS model satisfactorily predicted the micro-ecosystem simulated diazinon transport for the 0%, 50% and 100% VFS cover conditions. Model sensitivity analyses indicated that pesticide transfer from surface soil to overland flow and the pesticide washoff from VFS were important mechanisms affecting diazinon transport. The combination of rainfall intensity and VFS coverage are important design factors. However, at small rainfall intensities, increasing VFS coverage may provide little additional diazinon runoff control. For a 35 mm/hr rainfall intensity, even 25% VFS coverage significantly reduced diazinon losses in runoff. The PRVFS model is shown to be a beneficial tool for evaluating and analyzing possible Best Management Practices for controlling offsite runoff of pesticides applied in orchard production.

AB  - <![CDATA[The importance of protecting and conserving sustained aquatic habitats has never been more important as more and more habitats are lost due to a host of imposing threats. Mitigation of impacts from major threats and habitat conservation will ensure future reserves that may be required to further restore diminished habitats and ensure a surviving population of aquatic species. Globally natural resources have been threatened by human activities, changing ecosystems and climate change. As researchers observe decades of environmental monitoring and expand on extensive amounts of research, it becomes evident that the threats to our environment are extraordinarily complex. For the purpose of this thesis, focus is placed on one of the most vulnerable habitats today, the aquatic habitat. Many scientists agree that aquatic habitats play a larger role in determining the health and quality of inland waters and ecosystems than their more recognized role in producing a human resource. (Abell, 2009; Graham and Harrod, 2009; Winfield, 2009) Specifically, the global population of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) has remained a desired resource for decades. Only in the last few decades has the severity of population decline become a topic of considerable research as well as the focus of large conservation efforts by private and governmental organizations around the globe. This thesis discusses the primary threats that aquatic habitats face and how they may respond to a variable environment. Subsequently riparian zone management are examined for its role in ecological functions and the possibility for mitigating pollutant transport for an overall improved habitat. Thereafter, the South Esk catchment area is introduced as a primary site for conservation of aquatic habitats, including the Atlantic salmon. It has been awarded a host of local and regional designations, which ensure its role in the development of improved conservation and management techniques. The catchment has been the site of many years of research regarding aquatic habitats and their decline making it an excellent subject for this thesis. The study was conducted through the use of desk based research, with a focus on literature specifically applicable to the South Esk catchment. A field study was also conducted of which, the focus of the study was to ascertain potential causes of diminished aquatic habitat and associated characteristics. Observations such as bankside characteristics, riparian vegetation, surrounding land use, pollution sources, and evidence of structural damages were made. Furthermore data was collected with the hope to create riparian buffer zones and inland forested zones. A significant amount of livestock damage was found inland and along the riverbank. There were extreme amounts of bankside erosion and moderate levels of bankside collapse. Additionally, current management efforts such as fencing have remained ineffective in mitigating livestock damage at the river site. Observations in the inland fields noted a significant amount of drainage ditches present and supplying heavy sediment loads to the river. Limitations of the survey method included unexpected weather events, time constraints and inexperience with the survey methods. These limitations should be considered and aimed to be avoided for subsequent surveys. A discussion of the literature research and field based survey concluded with a primary focus on the involvement of key stakeholder, such as landowners, in the process of developing a management plan. This can prevent issues arising between the private, non-profit and governmental actors involved. Furthermore, the importance of collaborative approaches was discussed with particular focus on issues relating to the removal of land from agriculture in order to be placed into conservation programmes.

AB  - <![CDATA[The importance of protecting and conserving sustained aquatic habitats has never been more important as more and more habitats are lost due to a host of imposing threats. Mitigation of impacts from major threats and habitat conservation will ensure future reserves that may be required to further restore diminished habitats and ensure a surviving population of aquatic species. Globally natural resources have been threatened by human activities, changing ecosystems and climate change. As researchers observe decades of environmental monitoring and expand on extensive amounts of research, it becomes evident that the threats to our environment are extraordinarily complex. For the purpose of this thesis, focus is placed on one of the most vulnerable habitats today, the aquatic habitat. Many scientists agree that aquatic habitats play a larger role in determining the health and quality of inland waters and ecosystems than their more recognized role in producing a human resource. (Abell, 2009; Graham and Harrod, 2009; Winfield, 2009) Specifically, the global population of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) has remained a desired resource for decades. Only in the last few decades has the severity of population decline become a topic of considerable research as well as the focus of large conservation efforts by private and governmental organizations around the globe. This thesis discusses the primary threats that aquatic habitats face and how they may respond to a variable environment. Subsequently riparian zone management are examined for its role in ecological functions and the possibility for mitigating pollutant transport for an overall improved habitat. Thereafter, the South Esk catchment area is introduced as a primary site for conservation of aquatic habitats, including the Atlantic salmon. It has been awarded a host of local and regional designations, which ensure its role in the development of improved conservation and management techniques. The catchment has been the site of many years of research regarding aquatic habitats and their decline making it an excellent subject for this thesis. The study was conducted through the use of desk based research, with a focus on literature specifically applicable to the South Esk catchment. A field study was also conducted of which, the focus of the study was to ascertain potential causes of diminished aquatic habitat and associated characteristics. Observations such as bankside characteristics, riparian vegetation, surrounding land use, pollution sources, and evidence of structural damages were made. Furthermore data was collected with the hope to create riparian buffer zones and inland forested zones. A significant amount of livestock damage was found inland and along the riverbank. There were extreme amounts of bankside erosion and moderate levels of bankside collapse. Additionally, current management efforts such as fencing have remained ineffective in mitigating livestock damage at the river site. Observations in the inland fields noted a significant amount of drainage ditches present and supplying heavy sediment loads to the river. Limitations of the survey method included unexpected weather events, time constraints and inexperience with the survey methods. These limitations should be considered and aimed to be avoided for subsequent surveys. A discussion of the literature research and field based survey concluded with a primary focus on the involvement of key stakeholder, such as landowners, in the process of developing a management plan. This can prevent issues arising between the private, non-profit and governmental actors involved. Furthermore, the importance of collaborative approaches was discussed with particular focus on issues relating to the removal of land from agriculture in order to be placed into conservation programmes. These relationships can be vital to the success of a management plan. The establishment of buffer zones was established an appropriate mitigation measure for the improvement of the aquatic habitat. Two designs were recommended for use a d it was concluded that both grass and woody vegetative buffer types would be successful within the survey site of the South Esk catchment. Furthermore, fencing was shown to be a successful way to increase growth and was suggested as a primary method for mitigation in order to begin natural or planted regeneration of the riparian zone and inland forest areas. It is the hope that current landowners see a positive result from the work within the survey site, and as a result, become willing to build better relationships with conservation organizations for the betterment of our environment.]]>

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is a serious pest of potatoes and other solanaceous crops in North America and Europe. Reliance on chemical control has induced pesticide resistance, necessitating alternative management strategies based primarily on biological and cultural tactics. Better knowledge of this insect's movement, particularly its flight, could aid greatly in developing cultural controls. Computer-linked flight mills were used to study flight of overwintered and summer-generation female CPB fed in the laboratory on seven different solanaceous plant species. Over 30 days, flight was greatest with starved overwintered females three to six days postemergence. Flight for the overwintered generation was negatively related to desirability of food, as measured by larval success. Flight for summer females, and fecundity for both generations, was positively related to food desirability. Starved females laid virtually no eggs; starved summer females did not fly. Flight and fecundity of individual females were not related within treatments. Field investigations examined adult immigration to the same plant species over time and space, the distribution of overwintering adults, and disruption of their spring colonization to nonrotated potato crops. Recruitment to plots placed either near or far from potato crops showed that long-distance flight was primarily by starved overwintered adults, and also by fed first summer-generation adults. Two periods of short-distance dispersal occurred with older overwintered adults, and before diapause. Results suggest that the value of crop rotation depends on site-specific factors, not just the distance to overwintering sites or current-year potato crops. Overwintering distribution was studied at three sites over two years. CPB concentrated within woody borders, averaging 60-200/m$\sp2$ in these areas before winter, compared to 8-13/m$\sp2$ within potato fields. Mortality was higher in fields than in borders, and greater near the ground surface. Only 15-44% of live beetles were in potato fields. In experiments with small plots, colonization of fields from woody borders was disrupted by a trap crop, either treated with pesticide or collected daily. Simulation models suggest that this colonization disruption tactic could significantly reduce pesticide applications and eliminate the need for disruptive treatments against adult beetles.

AB  - The aims of this thesis were to evaluate the effect of organic, vs. conventional farming management, landscape structure, patch history and habitat on biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Species richness and composition of butterflies were in focus, but richness and composition of carabids and plants, and richness of rove beetles and spiders were also studied Species inventories were performed at 8 organic and 8 conventional farms located in south-eastern Sweden. Landscape structure was measured at three scales; on multiple farms (large-scale landscape heterogeneity), on farm level (small-scale landscape heterogeneity) and on multiple fields within farms. Butterfly species richness did not differ between farming systems, but increased with landscape heterogeneity. Both large- and small-scale landscape heterogeneity were important for butterfly species composition. Species richness of butterflies, carabids, rove beetles, spiders, and plants were not correlated. Overall species richness (i.e . butterflies, rove beetles, spiders and plants) did not differ between farming systems, except for carabids that had more species on conventional farms, and increasing with small-scale landscape heterogeneity. Habitat had a major effect on species richness for most groups, with most species found in semi-natural pastures and ley margins than in field margins. Habitat type explained most of the variation in species composition of butterflies, carabids, and plants. Landscape heterogeneity explained additional of the variation, but little relative to habitat. Farming system also explained additional variation but was of minor importance. Butterfly species composition was influenced by the history of the farms, but did not seem to be affected by management continuity. To conclude, landscape heterogeneity and habitat type were more important for species richness than farming system. Species composition depended more on local factors, varying between taxonomic groups. Since there were a differences in species composition between habitats, it seems important for biodiversity on a landscape scale to preserve many different habitats. By preserving a landscape considering only selected features or by changing the agricultural landscape with respect to certain features will unfortunately not benefit all species. Conservation strategies for biodiversity have to be diverse per se to enhance biodiversity of different groups of organisms in the agricultural landscape.

AB  - Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) and fertilizer application to row crops may contribute to poor water quality in surface waters. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated nutrient concentrations and fluxes in four Eastern Iowa watersheds sampled between 1996 and 2004. We found that these watersheds contribute nearly 10% of annual nitrate flux entering the Gulf of Mexico, while representing only 1.5% of the contributing drainage basin. Mass budget analysis shows stream flow to be a major loss of nitrogen (18% of total N output), second only to crop harvest (80%). The major watershed inputs of nitrogen include applied fertilizer for corn (52% of total N input) and nitrogen fixation by soybeans (25%). Despite the relatively small input from animal manure (∼7.5%), the results of spatial analysis indicate that row crop and CAFO densities are significantly and independently correlated to higher nitrate concentration in streams. Pearson Correlation Coefficients of 0.59 and 0.89 were found between nitrate concentration and row crop and CAFO density, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis produced a correlation for nitrate concentration with an R 2 value of 85%. High spatial density of row crops and CAFOs are linked to the highest river nitrate concentrations (up to 15 mg/l normalized over five years). We constructed a network model with the capability to predict nitrate concentration and flux for the Cedar, Iowa, Skunk and Wapsipinicon Rivers in eastern Iowa. This model accounts for nitrate flux from agricultural activities, point source emissions and from upstream river sections. We found evidence suggesting that denitrification plays a small but measurable role in estimating river nitrate concentrations. Using our water quality database and network model, we evaluated several mitigation strategies to reduce nitrate concentration below the USEPA limit of 10 mg/l. Eliminating CAFOs from some sub-watersheds, as well as redistributing CAFOs within watersheds, showed promising results. Reducing row crop acreage was not universally successful in reducing nitrate below the 10 mg/l target and reductions in point source emissions had little effect on riverine nitrate concentrations. Our analysis of riparian buffer zones around streams was inconclusive in that statistical correlations and confidence levels.

AB  - Agricultural streams are subject to considerable disturbance including channelization, erosion, and sedimentation. Fertilizer is often applied to agricultural fields in excess of crop demand, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can be transported to streams. When contaminated water reaches nutrient-sensitive aquatic areas, excess N and P cause eutrophication and often result in algal blooms, anoxia, and fish kills. Stream restoration has been performed to improve channel structure but also aims to improve multiple stream functions, including water quality. Through this research, I sought to characterize the impact of restoration on N removal via denitrification. Denitrification is a desirable removal process for N in aquatic ecosystems because it transforms a biologically active form of N (NO3 - ) into gaseous forms (N2 O and N2 ) which are returned to the atmosphere. Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was measured seasonally in riparian soil and floodplain and stream sediment in agricultural restored and unrestored stream reaches using the acetylene block method. Across all sites, DEA was significantly higher in floodplain and riparian zones than in-stream (p < 0.001) and dormant season DEA was significantly higher than growing season DEA (p < 0.001). These results highlight the importance of soil texture in stream sediments and percent moisture and organic carbon in riparian and floodplain areas in controlling DEA. It also illustrates the importance of stream-floodplain connectivity and riparian buffers in improving water quality.

AB  - Non-point source pollutants are a dominant threat to aquatic ecosystems in agriculturally dominated watersheds of the Midwest. Erosion and run-off from crop fields not only lowers the productivity of the field, but also transports sediment and attached nutrients or other agri-chemicals to receiving waters. In-field and edge-of-field best management practices (BMPs) have long been recognized as efficient ways to alleviate sediment impacts; however, prioritizing placement of these BMPs is critical to efficiently utilize allocated resources. A watershed assessment, utilizing the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Watershed Project Planning Protocol (WPPP) framework, was conducted on the Squaw Creek Watershed (SCW) in central, Iowa and included four assessment components. The first component inventoried land cover and tillage management practices throughout the landscape, allowing for calculation of erosion and sediment delivery estimates and highlighting sources of sediment. The second component utilized the Rapid Assessment of Stream Conditions Along Length (RASCAL), to assess in- and near-stream assessment stream conditions, including riparian landuse and stream bank stability. The third component utilized a geographic information system (GIS) and terrain indices to develop a riparian buffer placement tool to locate stream lengths intercepting high sediment loads and providing optimal conditions for the placement of riparian buffers. The final component utilized the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program to assess water quality parameters including nitrate-nitrogen, phosphate-phosphorus and E. coli. Results from these four components were analyzed within the seven hydrologic unit code (HUC) 12 sub-watersheds that make up the SCW. This allowed the prioritization of sub-watersheds based on need for conservation practice establishment. The Onion Creek sub-watershed was identified as potentially having high levels of delivered sediment with the prospect of benefiting from riparian buffer placement. Other sub-watersheds identified as higher priority for conservation practice establishment were Montgomery Creek because of intensive grazing effects and Worrell Creek and Crooked Creek 3 because of erosion concerns. These results can direct further work within these sub-watersheds with the intention of implementing watershed improvement projects that will include placement of BMPs to alleviate the effects of NPS pollutants.

AB  - The research reported in this thesis examined the impact of natural areas in local and broad-scale landscapes on biological control in Wisconsin potatoes. At a local scale, I examined the impact of grassy field margins within 200 m of the crop on biological control. At a broad scale, I examined the impact of non-crop habitats within 1.5 km of potato fields. To examine the impacts of these habitats on biological control, field studies addressed two questions: (1) do non-crop habitats influence the diversity of natural enemies in potatoes, and at what scale? and (2) at what scale is predation of the potato pests Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) impacted by non-crop habitats? To address the first question, predatory ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were sampled in 19 commercial potato fields and grassy field margins in 2005. This study showed that beetle diversity in potatoes increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km. Grassy field margins supported more species than potatoes, but there was no evidence these habitats influenced diversity in the crop. Secondly, predation of Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) were measured in potato fields in 2005 and 2006. Results suggest that predation of these two pests is differentially influenced by local- and broad-scale landscape structure. To complement broad-scale studies, I also conducted small-scale experiments. The first study asked the question: Is it important to conserve diverse predators that attack different life stages of L. decemlineata ? Results suggest that the importance of conserving functionally diverse predators depends on prey density. A second experiment examined the impact of planting native warm-season grasses on predation of L. decemlineata eggs. Predation of eggs was elevated in potatoes surrounded by grasses, and this appeared to be due to increased abundance of harvestmen (Opiliones). Overall, this research shows that conserving non-crop habitats can influence predator diversity and predation of potato pests. However, the appropriate scale of habitat conservation and the importance of conserving diverse predators are highly dependent on the biology of the organisms involved.

AB  - Populations of Tanacetum vulgare L., common tansy, were studied to contribute to a pest management plan, and to assess the potential for the use of classical biological control in Alberta. T. vulgare populations have expanded in the past decade and colonized pasture habitats and riparian zones. Current control methods are ineffective in limiting population expansions. Annual costs of current controls approach threshold losses that are considered as justification for classical biological control. T. vulgare employs numerous successful strategies for establishment and persistence in roadside, stream bank and pasture habitats. Maintenance of a vigorous perennial rootstock is essential to the production of large amounts of seed. However, vegetative spread does not appear to be as important to population expansion as seed dispersal and seedling establishment. The few European descriptions of morphology and phenology of T. vulgare are consistent with those experimentally observed in Alberta. Of the limited number of polyphagous insects feeding on T. vulgare in north central Alberta, none are abundant enough nor inflict damage at a level capable of negatively affecting T. vulgare populations. T. vulgare response to simulated herbivory was shown to be highly conditional depending on the type of defoliation, natural habitat, and moisture and light availability. Sexual reproductive potential was significantly reduced by defoliation but vegetative growth was relatively stable over the course of the experiments. T. vulgare growing in a shaded riparian zone were more adversely affected by defoliation than those in a roadside habitat. Population changes in grazed pastures, including decreases in density and changes in age classes, appear related to the type of herbivore and environmental factors.

AB  - The Sugar Creek Watershed (SCW) of Holmes, Stark, Tuscarawas, and Wayne counties, Ohio is currently one of the most polluted watersheds in the state. There are several small municipalities that influence the overall condition of the watershed, but the primary problem is non-point source pollution from the many farms in the Sugar Creek region. There are highly mechanized farms that utilize modern technology (machinery, chemicals etc.), and there are farms (Amish) that are of a more primitive nature that rely on animal power and animal waste. Both of these farm types contribute to the non-point source pollution problem in the SCW, but the focus of this particular study are the Old Order Amish farms that are in the SE corner of Wayne County, the SW corner of Stark County and the NE corner of Holmes County Ohio. Complicating the problem has been the removal of riparian buffer zones from a large portion of the SCW, and a historical ignorance of the importance of maintaining a clean water supply. The cultural and religious beliefs of local societies have a big impact on the level of concern about environmental issues. Numerous efforts have been made to educate the local population about the importance of restoring the environmental health of the watershed, but very little has been done to determine the environmental beliefs of the Old Order Amish.

AB  - This is an ecological study of traditional maize-based agriculture in the Texcoco River watershed, concerned with changing environmental conditions, the adoption of modern agricultural technologies, and the impact of current farming practices on maize yields and soil fertility. Seventy-five maize fields were sampled in the middle, agricultural part of the watershed in the summer of 1997, and each farmer (n = 70) was interviewed about cultivation practices used. Site and soil variables measured at each field were slope, altitude, soil depth, and soil organic matter content (OM), pH, N, P, K, Mg, Ca, cation exchange capacity and texture. Crop management variables summarized from farmer interviews cover all aspects of crop production, from the schedule and timing of cultivation activities, to cropping patterns, fertilizer use, and the use of terraces and field borders. Soils in the area vary greatly in depth and are generally sandy, low in OM, and nutrient poor, particularly in N and P. Soil depth emerged as the biophysical factor most correlated with maize yields, perhaps because absolute amounts of available soil nutrients are lower in shallow soils. Topographical position in the watershed was also correlated with maize yields and soil fertility. Yields, OM, and concentrations of some nutrients are greater further up-slope in the study area. Farming practices are changing in the study area, as farmers are incorporating some "modern" practices into their traditional maize cultivation. Tractors and chemical fertilizers are widely used, and maize monocultures are replacing the traditional maize-beans-squash intercrop. Farming practices do not differ significantly between ecological units in the study area, and no clear relationships were observed between the different farming practices, and maize yields and soil fertility. This thesis also includes discussion of the approach taken to working with farmers in this study, and some historical, cultural and social background information that forms the context for traditional agriculture in the area.

AB  - Ecosystem engineering--the physical modification of habitats by organisms--can affect species richness at different spatial scales. By altering resource levels, patches created by ecosystem engineering are likely to contain different species than unmodified patches. This can affect species richness at the landscape and patch scales. Forces controlling differences in richness between engineered patches and the distribution of engineered patches throughout the landscape can affect the magnitude of the effect of engineering on species richness at multiple spatial scales. I examine the effect of ecosystem engineering on species richness at multiple spatial scales using wetlands created by beaver (Castor canadensis ) as a model system. By creating patches containing a different set of species than forested riparian zones, ecosystem engineering by beaver increases species richness at the landscape scale by approximately 33%. I suggest that ecosystem engineers will increase species richness at the landscape scale whenever there are species present in a landscape that are restricted to engineered habitats. Results from a combination of experimental and observational approaches suggest that species richness within beaver-created wetlands is more strongly controlled by local factors, such as within meadow variability in hydrology, but that the population dynamics of beaver could potentially affect species richness by altering the age distribution of meadows across the landscape. I developed a set of models that links the population dynamics of ecosystem engineers to the dynamics of the patches that they create, and used data on the population dynamics of beaver to estimate model parameters. I used these estimates to perform simulations on the effects of varying parameters on the distribution of different patch types and suggest a number of hypotheses that derive from model predictions that could test the model. The effect of ecosystem engineers on species richness at the patch scale should be predictable based on knowledge of how the engineer affects productivity. Using data collected from the literature, I found a significant negative relationship between productivity and the engineering effect on species richness when ecosystem engineers increased productivity and a significant positive relationship when engineers decreased productivity, matching the predictions of my conceptual model.

AB  - There are a variety of substantial resources dedicated to the restoration of impaired waters as the health of the nation's aquatic ecosystems is constantly declining. There is a significant amount of data indicates that water quality of both the Chesapeake Bay and the Lower Mississippi River Basin water has altered over the past hundred years for a variety of reasons. This research presents the comparison of the dynamics and modalities of transported nitrates and phosphates by tributaries of the lower Mississippi River basin and the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrates and phosphates fate and transport has impacted the economic, environmental, and recreational benefits as well as induce. The Environmental Protection Agency indicates that in the Mississippi River basin, 39 percent of streams have high levels of nitrogen while 32 percent of streams have high levels of phosphorus. Nitrogen (N) from urban and urbanizing watersheds is a major contributor to water quality degradation and eutrophication of receiving water bodies (Shields, et. al, 2008). Agricultural processes in urbanizing watersheds contribute to transport of excessive nutrient loads. There is intake of excessive nitrogen and phosphorus in over 60% of coastal rivers and bays in the United States (Motavalli, et. al, 2008). The implementation of urban and forestry Best Management Practices for the reduction of hypoxia could be effected using riparian buffers. Best Management Practices would control the downstream flow of agricultural related nutrients from the upper Mississippi River basin, which has the highest concentrations of nitrogen occurrence.

AB  - The overall goal of this research was to evaluate the effects of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers on stream bank erosion. This goal was addressed by measuring the erodibility and critical shear stress of rooted bank soils in situ using a submerged jet test device. Additionally, several soil, vegetation, and stream chemistry factors that could potentially impact the fluvial entrainment of soils were measured. A total of 25 field sites in the Blacksburg, Virginia area were tested. Each field site consisted of a 2 nd -4 th order stream with a relatively homogeneous vegetated riparian buffer over a 30 m reach. Riparian vegetation ranged from short turfgrass to mature riparian forest. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine those factors that most influence stream bank erodibility and the relative impact of riparian vegetation. Results of this research indicated woody riparian vegetation reduced the susceptibility of stream bank soils to erosion by fluvial entrainment. Riparian forests had a greater density of larger diameter roots, particularly at the bank toe where the hydraulic stresses are the greatest. These larger roots (diameters > 0.5 mm) provided more resistance to erosion than the very fine roots of herbaceous plants. Due to limitations in the root sampling methodology, these results are primarily applicable to steep banks with little herbaceous vegetation on the bank face, such as those found on the outside of meander bends.

AB  - Water quality trading (WQT) can occur when the point source (PS) dischargers are allowed to claim credits through paying the farmers for adopting Best Management Practices (BMPs) so as to economically achieve pollution-control goals. Although the benefits of WQT have been modeled as effective, only a few trades have taken place. Limited knowledge about the supply side is one important impediment. Based on the case study in the Upper Scioto Watershed (USW) of Ohio, where a WQT program was proposed to help the wastewater treatment plants to meet a more stringent regulation of nutrient discharge, this study evaluates: 1) the extent to which agricultural NPS has the potential for creating a supply of credits from BMPs in a cost-effective manner, and 2) the mechanism that determines BMP adoption by farmers. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was employed to appraise the agricultural NPS and BMPs. Interviews with 79 active farmers and 113 non-farming landowners in the USW were performed to elicit information on farm tenancy and conservation. BMPs involving nutrient management (NM), conservation tillage (CST), cover crops (CC), diversified crop rotations (DCR), grassed waterways (GW), and filter strips (FS) were considered. First, by coupling the SWAT simulation with the BMP cost-effectiveness analysis, it was found that: 1) cropland, accounting for about 60% of the USW, exported 4 and 3 times more TN and TP, respectively, to the watershed than the PS counterparts, which provided a possibility for trades to occur; 2) credits generated through CST, CC, and NM were generally more attractive than that from FS; and 3) prices of credits varied from field to field, depending on the baseline nutrient loads and crop yields. Second, the survey showed that farm tenancy, occurring on over 60% of the farmland in the USW, potentially affected conservation adoption. Tenancy rate was positively correlated with the adoption of CST. Adoption rate of DCR and GW/FS by farmers on the ground they rented was apparently lower than which they owned. Minor differences were found in the adoption rate of NM and CC between the owned and rented ground. The rental relationship between landlords and renters was fairly stable. Renters' conservation behavior was significantly associated with attributes of the leasing arrangement. Third, statistics derived from the survey were incorporated into SWAT to tackle the water quality effect of different farm tenancy scenarios, which were formulated through various combinations of crop rotation, tillage, and application of CC, NM, and subsurface drainage. By increasing tenancy rate from 0% to 100%, the average annual sediment, TN, and TP loads were projected to increase by 2.6%, 4.2%, and 4.5%, respectively. Although farm tenancy possessed a negative effect on water quality, the effect was fairly minor. Finally, a broad scrutiny was conducted to identify characteristics of farmers who were prone to conservation. Barriers to convert to BMPs were summarized. Overall, farmers' education level, farm structure variables, farm tenancy and the perceived economic effectiveness of BMPs were the most important factors in determining adoption or non-adoption.

AB  - Nutrient inputs from agriculture are a leading contributor to nonpoint source pollution of surface and ground waters. Crop production while maintaining water quality requires the use of best management practices (BMPs) to minimize nutrient loss. Nutrient management is the broad term to describe the suite of practices used to control the rate, form, timing, and transport of plant nutrients. Agricultural water quality BMPs can be broadly categorized into source and transport practices. Source BMPs focus on plant nutrient applications and include the quantity of nutrients applied, manure application strategies, and agronomic and environmental soil testing. Transport BMPs generally refer to physical structures designed to mitigate nutrient losses to the environment and include sediment control structures, grass filter strips, and riparian buffers. Source and transport BMPs are widely used, but few field-based studies have been conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in relation to soil-landscape variability. A series of three studies were undertaken to investigate site-level factors affecting nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in soil and shallow ground water among cropland and riparian buffers. The first study was designed to determine the potential for inorganic N movement to shallow ground water, and the potential for mitigation in riparian buffers. The second study involved a more detailed study of soil-landscape factors influencing N leaching in cropland and transformations in buffers. The last study was undertaken to examine relationships among soil P availability, soil-landscape factors, and concentrations and forms of P in shallow ground water. Soil-landscape factors critically influenced ground water N concentrations and fluxes in cropland and riparian buffers. Results showed that N inputs, water table depth, and ground water dissolved oxygen concentration could be used to estimate shallow ground water nitrate concentrations in cropland, and as an index of attenuation in buffers. Poorly and very poorly drained riparian soils tended to have lower ground water nitrate concentrations and fluxes, higher ammonium, and low dissolved oxygen. Soil P availability in cropland soils was strongly correlated with soil solution P concentrations, but not correlated with ground water P. Riparian soils maintained significantly lower soil solution dissolved P concentrations relative to cropland. Two-year mean buffer ground water dissolved reactive P concentrations were lower than cropland concentrations. Average total dissolved and particulate ground water P were highest in riparian forest buffers. Results showed that poorly drained riparian soils were consistently effective at reducing ground water nitrate concentrations and fluxes. However, thermodynamic conditions favoring nitrate removal in buffers were associated with greater total P in ground water. Results suggest that the integration of nutrient source factors with site-specific soil and landscape variability was a useful approach for indexing nutrient loss potentials from cropland and attenuation in buffers.

AB  - Tropical montane rain forest reaches its uppermost elevations inside Rio Abiseo National Park, north-central Peru, within a complex landscape of isolated forest patches on valley sides and inverted treelines on valley bottoms. In two valleys of the Park, I documented and analyzed patterns of woody plant composition and forest structure along several environmental gradients, and related these and other findings to issues of conservation in Peru. A one ha inventory plot of this timberline forest, bordering on tropical alpine grasslands, contained 46 tree and shrub species (dbh $\geq$ 2.5 cm), with a density of 1801 stems/ha, a basal area of 38.8 m$\sp2$/ha, and a canopy height of 8-10 m. Generally, this forest fit with previous descriptions of high-elevation montane rain forests in the tropics, with the exception of possessing both a large modal leaf size and emergents 20 m tall. Tree and shrub populations were classified into four types based on their relative stature (large or small) and shade tolerance (small size classes present or absent in forest interior). These analyses showed that roughly half of the plot contained species whose regeneration was limited to forest margins, implying that current composition was not stable. The effect of forest edge on composition and structure was then studied in relation to changes in elevation within the study area using different sampling strategies. These studies showed that elevation was another very important environmental gradient in the study area; it was associated with high species turnover over changes of only 100-200 m in elevation, and narrow altitudinal zones of active regeneration among forest-interior species. The montane and lower montane forest of the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes contain approximately 2400-2800 vascular plant species, or 14% of Peru's flora. A preliminary extrapolation of the results of this thesis to the entire zone would predict that (1) elevation will be a fundamentally important environmental gradient, (2) forest edges are dynamic and often dominated by shade-intolerant species, and (3) forest destruction by humans that creates forest edges could markedly change natural patterns of species diversity and abundance.

AB  - Historic degradation and destruction of riparian vegetation in California has resulted in a loss of wildlife habitat, biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Riparian buffer zones in agricultural landscapes can be managed or restored in order to provide multiple benefits, but information is lacking on the tradeoffs involved in these management decisions. We examined the effects of land use (range vs. cropland), distance from the channel, and plant communities on above- and belowground diversity and ecosystem services in a survey of 20 sites along waterways in Yolo County. Riparian zones supported greater plant diversity and nearly twice as much total carbon (C) storage per hectare compared to adjacent land managed for agricultural uses, especially in rangelands, but had generally lower soil microbial and nematode diversity and abundance. When woody plant communities were present in the riparian zone, soil nitrate (NO 3- ) and plant-available phosphorus (P) levels were lower. Belowground diversity and community structure appeared to depend more on plant productivity (as inferred by vegetation cover) than plant diversity or species richness. Greater plant species richness, nematode food web structure, total microbial biomass, woody C storage and lower NO 3- and P loading were correlated with higher visual riparian health assessment scores, offering the possibility of managing these riparian habitats to provide multiple ecosystem functions. We then assessed the effects of revegetation, floodplain bench creation and grazing on selected ecosystem characteristics and services in a case study of a 7-year-old riparian restoration site in Yolo County. Restoration increased richness and cover of native plant species beneficial to wildlife. Some restored habitats had higher wood C storage, but slightly higher greenhouse gas emissions and lower microbial biomass carbon than the unrestored site. Ruminant grazing increased cover and richness of noxious weed species and decreased natives. Levee setback and creation of a floodplain bench increased bank stability, reduced flooding potential, and did not decrease soil C stocks or nematode abundance and diversity despite massive top soil disturbance during excavation and grading. These studies provide a resource for landowners and managers to consider the tradeoffs of different types of riparian restoration and management for multiple ecosystem benefits.

AB  - The tall-grass prairies, wetlands and forests that dominated the Iowa landscape have been replaced by annual row-crops and grass pastures that occupy more than 90% of the landscape today. Because of these changes, water reaches streams and gullies much faster and has led to incised streams and an extensive growth of gully networks. Stream and gully banks are major contributors of non-point source sediment and phosphorus. Reducing these pollutants is a priority to maintaining healthy streams. The objective of this study was to compare stream and gully bank soil and phosphorus losses under different land-use practices in three Iowa regions. The hypothesis was that stream and gully bank erosion would decrease in the following order: annual row-cropped fields, continuous pastures, rotational pastures, intensive rotational pastures, pastures with cattle excluded from the stream, grass filters and riparian forest buffers. In rotational and intensive rotational grazing the pastures are divided into paddocks. One paddock is grazed at a time while the others are rested. To estimate soil losses for each treatment, erosion pins were used for stream and gully bank rates and all the severe eroding site areas were measured. Estimating soil total phosphorus concentrations from the stream and gully bank faces allowed us to estimate phosphorus losses. In addition phosphorus concentrations in riparian areas, stream and gully beds and loafing areas were measured. Riparian forest buffers, grass filters and pastures with the cattle excluded from the stream had the lowest soil and phosphorus losses from stream and gully bank erosion. Row-cropped fields had high soil and phosphorus losses, similar to the continuous pastures. There are some indications that moving to rotational and intensive rotational pastures soil and phosphorus losses could decrease bank soil and phosphorous losses compared to continuous pastures. The effectiveness of rotational and intensive rotational pastures will depend on the number of paddocks along the stream, stocking rates, grazing in the stream paddocks during wet periods and how well landowners follow the pasture system guidelines. Finally cow entry points and loafing areas should require special attention because they can be major sources of soil and phosphorus to streams.

AB  - The cumulative impacts of urbanization of a watershed present serious challenges to traditional scientific and management approaches in protecting aquatic resources. An integrated approach is required, balancing the complexity of the scientific analysis with the need for simple and clear answers on the health of the watershed and the types of management actions required to achieve certain objectives. This study has developed a methodology for urban watershed assessment which can serve as a useful tool in support of integrated watershed management. To guide the development of the assessment methodology, a framework was developed for integrated watershed management, based on a general literature review and examples of approaches currently in use by various jurisdictions. The framework defines the role of watershed assessment, suggests a set of desirable attributes of an assessment methodology, and establishes criteria for the development, selection aid use of indicators in watershed assessment. The urban watershed assessment methodology itself incorporates aspects from various other fields of study (including ecological risk assessment, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cumulative effects assessment, and environmental indicators) in a manner consistent with the framework. The methodology consist of a simple five-step approach: (i) the development of a generic conceptual model of the urban watershed ecosystem; (ii) the selection a set of key indicators; (iii) the integration of a combination of sub-indicators when required; (iv) the scaling of indicators into a 5-category classification system (from excellent to very poor); and (v) the integration of the set of indicators into a simple, visual and comprehensive summary of the assessment. The application of the methodology is illustrated with a case study at the Brunette River watershed, a heavily urbanized watershed in the Greater Vancouver Region. Extensive use is made of existing data on the watershed; new data on riparian zones, spills and sources of pollutants were collected as the need for additional data to effectively illustrate the assessment methodology was identified. While some elements of the study are unique to the Brunette case study, much of the general framework and assessment methodology have wider applicability. This study has contributed substantially to the knowledge base on the Brunette River watershed through the collection of new data and improved interpretation and synthesis of existing data. This makes the scientific analysis more meaningful and accessible to the stakeholders involved in the management of the watershed. The integration of complex watershed information and the presentation of this information to a wider audience has been greatly facilitated by using a combination of GIS and hypermedia. This study was written entirely in hypermedia and makes use of non-linear sequencing of information, and elaborate visual materials to describe complex concepts and relationships, all of which enables a higher level of reader interaction than in print.

AB  - <P class=Abstract>The first chapter shows that the distribution of humid tropical forests is strongly associated with the spatial and temporal distribution of the maximum climatological water deficit.&nbsp; The analysis of climate simulations, used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, allowed for the projection of a simple climatological niche of humid tropical forests into the future (assuming global warming of 2 and 4°C), and identification of areas where forest boundary may experience rapid change.&nbsp; The subsequent chapters focus on an important tropical forest boundary zone, specifically the tree line between Andean montane forests and grasslands of the Altiplano.&nbsp; The analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of the Andes region faces extra methodological difficulty imposed by topography.&nbsp; Therefore, two chapters of this thesis are devoted to resolving the problem of the atmospheric bias in optical satellite imager of mountainous areas. The chapters introduce the atmospheric correction framework <I>LandCor</I> and conclude that there are enough satellite measurements of atmospheric constituents for a successful correction of all existing imagery of the Andes.&nbsp; These findings are then employed in the final chapter, with main aim of detecting climate-driven change in the contemporary eastern Andean tree line using satellite imagery.&nbsp; The results describe the relationship between current tree line position and climate, and show that, despite contemporary climate change, the tree line has not advanced over recent decades.&nbsp; The implications of this are discussed in the light of available climate change projections and theories concerning factors that control the tree line extent.</P>

AB  - Landscape characteristics are believed to have a close linkage with in-stream nutrient level. Both empirical and process-based approaches have been used to model the relationship between landscape characteristics and non-point source (NPS) nutrient loading level in the literature. Empirical models are suitable to explicitly define the relationships between landscape characteristics and nutrient fluxes. Spatially-explicit, process-based modeling can be used to explore the process-pattern interactions in an ecosystem. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Empirical regression models have been criticized for their oversimplification, poor predictive power, and possible scientific flaws, while process-based models have been blamed for its complicated nature, poor applicability, and prohibitive data requirements. The purpose of this dissertation research is to explore the possibility of coupling these two modeling approaches to better understand the relationship between watershed landscape characteristics and in-stream nutrient loading. To this end, a simple, spatially-explicit, process-based model, IGED (Integrated Grid's Exporting and Delivery model), is developed to estimate annual average in-stream nutrient loading at the watershed scale. Then, the validated IGED model is used to examine the impacts of watershed landscape characteristics upon the NPS nutrient loading measured at stream outlets. Two major issues are focused: the effectiveness of riparian buffers in controlling nutrient discharges to streams and the impact of watershed size on the regression model predictive power when using proportions of landscape types as predictors. In the first focus research area, the process-based model IGED is used to hep construct empirical models that explicitly address the riparian buffer and nutrient load relationship. In the second focus research area, the process-based model is used as a heuristic tool to verify and explain some exploratory observations derived from empirical regression modeling. The different roles of these two modeling approaches suggest the need of coupling them in order to improve the understanding of the relationship between the watershed landscape characteristics and the NPS nutrient loading.

AB  - Image registration is a technology for aligning images. In several decades, image registration has been developing rapidly, of which the theory is consummated continually, and many methods has been applied successfully. Image registration methods are mainly applied in three fields: medical application, remote sensing, and computer vision and pattern recognition. Image registration is foundation of computer vision, image fusing, three-dimention reconstruction, robut vision, image mosaicking, and vision detection. Three-dimentional registration and non-rigid registration have been hot spots in several years. However, the speed, precision, and robustness are key factors to restrict the application of this technology. Two-dimentional rigid registration is foundation of registration technology, and has a wide range of application fields. This dissertation is delicated to basic researches on two-demensional registration to raise the speed and robustness of the technology, and to make it more available in application. The methods presented in this dissertation can be extended to 3D image registration. The main work of this dissertation is following: 1. As a new similarity measurement, mutual information about distance field of image edges is presented and is used for image registration. The model image edge is transformed to a distance image. The greys of the distance image is quatified, and regarded as a discrete stochastic. The binary edge image of floating image is regarded as another stochastic variable. Calculate the joint distribution about two probability distributions of the two stochastic variables, and compute the mutual information between them, which is adopted as similarity function to register images. Combining the advantages of feature-based method in speed and mutual-information-based method in robustness about un-identical images, the method can register images that have not ideal edges accurately. 2. To avoid the disadvantages of the image registration method based on Hausdorff distance in registering the model edges and floating edges with excess parts, image registration based on generalized Hausdorff distance is proposed. At first, register the images by classical method based on mean Hausdorff distance coarsely, calculate the generalized Hausdorff distance from floating edges to model edges, assert and subtract the excess edge points in the floating edge image analyzing the generalized Hausdorff distance, and register the new floating edge point set to the model edges set. After several iterations, the accurate result of registration is obtained. The method can be used for registering the images which edges are un-identical, without complicated featured corresponding algorithm. It can be extended to 3D. 3. An image registration method based on rigid body dynamics is presented in this dissertation. In this method, the two edge sets are regarded as two particle systems, and edge points of the model image generate a pseudo elasticity field. Acted by the elasticity forces in the field, edges of floating image move and finally stop on the registration position with certain constrains. Without stochastic trials, the method makes floating edges to near registration target rapidly and directly, and have exellent runtime performance. The method can be combined with registration algorithm based on generalized Hausdorff distance, to register the images that have un-identical edges. On the basis of rigid-dynamics-based method, subtracting the excess edges in floating by the method based on generalized Hausdorff distance, the ideal registration result can be obtained after several iterations. 4. Pseudo gravitation field to nearst point and a new image registration approach based on it are presented. The edge points of model image are assumed to generate a nearest point pseudo gravitation field, and the floating edges are forced to move in the field. The average value of forces acting to floating image edge points is adopted as similarity function. With this method, on correct registration position, the effect of floating edges them is weaken greatly. Therefore the approach improves precision of image registration, decreases misregistration ratio. 5. An image registration frame based on multiresolution, multi-similarity function, multi-optimization method is presented in this dissertation. Using different similarity measures and optimization methods in different dimensions, the method utilizes advantages of manifold similarity measures and optimization methods. A hybrid method for image registration is proposed, in which in lowest dimension, adopting global optimization, the method can obtain the approximation of global optimum instead of local optimum; in other dimensions, adopting rapid local algorithm, the method gradually acquires precise registration result. The method uses rapid and coarse similarity measure in the lower dimensions, and precise and slow similarity measure in the highest dimension. The method has better synthetical performance in runtime and precision, and reduces misregistration ratio. 6. In the registration method based on mutual information, it is crucial to decrease the computation cost of mutual information. Mutual information is calculated frequently in the process of optimization, so decreasing the computation cost of it can increase its speed. In this dissertation, with a registration algorithm based on multi-resolution and hybrid optimization, the relationship between computation cost and the number of grey bins is analized, and the proposal in application is proposed.

AB  - With data from fixed sample plots of six main forest types in Lianxiahe small watershed of Three Gorge Reservoir Area of Yangtze River water conservation capacity has been studied, the results show that there is a binary linear regression for both throughfall and stemflow to precipitation quantity and precipitation intensity, and a power regression for canopy interception to rainfall. The relative interception ranges from 15.59 % to 25.45 % on an average of 20.95 %. Under the same rainfall the decrease order of canopy interception in the different forest types is coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest, Masson pine forest, broadleaf forest, coniferous mixed forest and cypress forest. The quantity of litter layer in different forest types varies from 10.52 t / hm2 to 21.97 t / hm2 on an average of 16.42 t / hm2, the decrease order of quantity of litter form is coniferous and broadleaf forest, cypress forest, Masson pine forest, coniferous forest, broadleaf forest and shrubbery. The maximum water holding capacity of litter form in different forest types varies from 2.66 mm to 4.19 mm on an average of 3.48 mm, and the decrease order is cypress forest, coniferous forest, coniferous and broadleaf forest, Masson pine forest, broadleaf forest and shrubbery. The water holding capacity of non-capillary porosity of soil layer in different forest types varies from 29.98 mm to 44.16 mm on an average of 38.62 mm, and the decrease order is cypress forest, coniferous and broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, Masson pine forest, shrubbery and broadleaf forest. The total interception decrease order of rainfall is cypress forest (51.77 mm), coniferous and broadleaf forest (48.49 mm), Masson pine forest (46.48 mm), coniferous forest (44.60 mm), shrubbery (37.76 mm) and broadleaf forest (35.36 mm) in different forest types. The whole forest ecosystem holding water per hectare varies from 353.6t to 517.7t, and value varies from 236.91 yuan to 346.86 yuan. The existing of natural broadleaf forest and Masson pine forest is enhanced to protect at the headstream of small watershed. Afforesting and grass planting through closing areas is carried out for the young tree and shrubbery. Convertion of farmland to forest or pasture (Sloping plowland <25°) is implemented at the middle and lower reaches of the river. High efficient economical forest is developed, for example, Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., Gingkgo biloba L., Castanea mollissima Bl. or Citrus reticulata Blanco. Model is popularized actively such as Pinus massoniana Lamb. ¿ Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc. ¿ Salvia miltiorrhizea bge. mixed forest. The beauty landscape construction is strengthened on the base of the rational exploitation tour resource with soil and water conservation construction. At the important area of river landscape, we should stress on planning, designing and rebuilding riparian buffer forest, developing forest through closing areas for the young tree, planting landscape forest at the wilderness, building tour road, canal and ropeway. It is supported energetically to add up some beauty villages and integrate with tour, sightseeing and economy development in order to come into being a summering resort with beauty environment and primitive simplicity and nature.

AB  - Riparian wetlands are important areas for regulating phosphorus (P) transfer in shallow groundwater. Limited knowledge is currently available regarding the effects of hydrological regimes on the transfer process of various P forms in shallow groundwater in upland-riparian-stream continuums in agricultural areas. This study focuses on P transfer in shallow groundwater within and between the riparian zone and hyporheic zone in Spencer Creek, and considers the effects on P transfer caused by flooding from the drawdown of the upstream Valens Reservoir, Hamilton, southern Ontario. A series of piezometer nests (each nest consisted of three piezometers at the depths of 50 cm, 100 cm and 150 cm) and corresponding wells were installed at the upland-riparian interface, riparian corridor and riparian-stream interface along two transects with different vegetation covers. Water chemistry was measured in groundwater and the stream from May 10 to October 20, 2006. The chemistry parameters included total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), soil-extractable phosphorus, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS) and pH. Water table elevation, hydraulic head and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat ) were measured at each location along the transects. Groundwater TP concentrations at the two transects ranged from 11.8 μgL -1 to 2685.6 μgL-1 with an average (mean ± standard error) of 365.2 ± 25.9 μgL-1 and from 12.7 μgL -1 to 8485.5 μgL-1 with an average of 742.4 ± 109.0 μgL-1 during baseflow and flood conditions, respectively. The groundwater SRP concentrations ranged from 3.6 μgL-1 to 417.9 μgL-1 with an average of 44.0 ± 3.8 μgL -1 and from 2.1 μgL-1 to 280.4 μgL-1 with an average of 33.9 ± 5.2 μgL-1 during baseflow and flood conditions, respectively. For both transects, mean TP and SRP concentrations in piezometers tended to increase with increasing distance from the field during both baseflow and flood. This trend was poorly correlated with depth. SRP concentrations in groundwater did not show the same decreasing trend by depth. The flood caused by the drawdown of upstream Valens Reservoir significantly increased TP concentrations (p=0.002) but significantly decreased SRP concentrations (p<0.001) in groundwater in the riparian zone. The TP concentrations at three depths were all significantly lower at transect T1 (predominantly grass cover) than T4 (predominantly forest cover) (50 cm: p=0.001; 100 cm: p<0.001; 150 cm: p<0.001). The SRP concentrations at 50 cm were significantly lower at transect T1 than T4 (p=0.003). There is little evidence to indicate groundwater flow from the field to the stream; rather it appeared to flow laterally from T1 to T4, across the riparian zone. The estimated lateral P flux in shallow groundwater were 2218.2 and 122845.0 μgm-2 d-1 for TP and 1295.1 and -57.1 μgm-2 d-1 for SRP during baseflow and flood conditions, respectively. Groundwater recharge zones characterized by zero or negative vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG's) were identified in the hyporheic zone along the two transects. The TP and SRP loads estimated from the stream channel toward the hyporheic zone at two transects ranged from 774.7 to 233005.6 μgm -2 d-1 and from 114.8 to 18381.2 μgm -2 d-1 during the study period. The flood may substantially increase TP and SRP loading because the VHG's are increased at the riparian-stream interface. The results of this study suggested that hydrology was a dominant factor regulating groundwater P transfer within the upland-riparian-stream continuum while other factors such as vegetation type and substrate characteristics were less important. The effectiveness of riparian zones to reduce P transport in groundwater from agricultural fields to adjacent streams will depend highly on site-specific hydrological regimes.

AB  - Shelterbelts function by reducing wind speed and altering turbulence fields in the sheltered area. The influence of a particular shelterbelt is dependent on its structure. The more complex the structure becomes the more difficult it is to accurately describe the flow fields associated with the shelterbelt. In order to improve the ability to predict the turbulence field and the resulting protection around the shelterbelt for a given structure, a structural description of the shelterbelt and an understanding of the air motion as determined by shelterbelt structure are required. It is proposed that the 3-dimensional aerodynamic structure of a shelterbelt is best described by its external structure: height, width and cross-sectional shape; and its internal structure: the amount and arrangement of vegetative surface area and volume as well as the geometric shape of the individual elements. This 3-dimensional structure can then be described by the spatial functions of vegetative surface area density (vegetative surface area per unit canopy volume) and cubic porosity (void volume per unit canopy volume). A model addressing the role of both structural descriptors in determining the air motion in a shelterbelt was developed. The model indicates that the drag force of a shelterbelt on the air flow is determined by vegetative surface area, volume and their spatial arrangement and that air divergence and convergence in a shelterbelt depend on both turbulent velocity and element arrangement. A method to estimate the spatial functions in the model was developed using field measurements. For actual estimation, the 3-dimensional spatial functions were decomposed into a combination of the definable equations describing the amount and arrangement of surface area and volume. Equations were derived and statistically defined for the tree trunk, branches, leaves, and seeds. The application of these equations to the estimation and description of green ash shelterbelt structure was demonstrated. Using the estimates, the structural terms in the model can be determined for the simulation of the turbulence field around the shelterbelt. The developed spatial functions and equations facilitate further research on the prediction of the turbulence flow around a shelterbelt with a given design.

AB  - Vegetated field margins are important landscape elements in many regions of Mexico. They can be traced to the pre-Hispanic period, especially in central Mexico, where Indians planted hedgerows, living fences and terraces, mainly to prevent erosion. Today, vegetated field margins are adjacent to crop fields and also form networks similar to those seen in Europe. An example is the agricultural landscape of El Bajío, Guanajuato, Mexico, where the density of hedgerows can reach 80 m per hectare. On average, hedgerows are 7-8-m wide, 6-m tall, with approximately 13 trees and three tree species for every 100 m of length. Field margins delineate properties and provide local farmers with many useful products, e.g., wood, fruit, medicine and fodder for animals. These structures also provide habitat for many plants and animals as well as serve as movement corridors through the agricultural landscape. To investigate the importance of field margins for birds, resident and Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds were surveyed in 40 field margins during spring and winter 1999 and 2000. The structural and botanical characteristics of the field margins, and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape, were related to bird species richness and abundance. At the local scale, the size of the field margin, its vertical complexity, and the abundance of trees and tree species had a positive influence on bird species richness and abundance. The most important landscape-scale variable was the density of hedgerows around field margins. These observations are considered in terms of practical management for bird conservation in the area. Finally, to examine if hedgerows in this landscape were functioning as sinks (ecological traps) of birds, artificial nests were used to compare rates of predation in two types of hedgerows with different vegetative structure (simple and complex), and a tract of scrub forest. Significantly greater predation rates were found in scrub forest and complex hedgerows than in simple hedgerows, reflecting the higher number of predator species found there. Hedgerows as well as other narrow corridors may not always be unsuitable for nesting birds. They are valuable to avifauna in regions of intensive agriculture and they need to be protected.
