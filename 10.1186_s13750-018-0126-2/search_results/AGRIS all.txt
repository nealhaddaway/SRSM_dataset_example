AB  - The booklet gives information aimed at dispelling the controversy around the veterinary cordon fence which, although put in place to limit animal disease transfer, was used during the South African occupation of Namibia for other purposes, giving the fence, or "red line" an unintended political connotation. Beef export is extremely important to the Namibian economy. Compliance with the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) international disease regulations is vital. These regulations state that to export meat to Foot and Mouth Disease-free markets, the country or zone in question must be separated from FMD infected areas by a series of boundaries which conform to laid down standards. The following zones must be separated by natural boundaries or artificial barriers such as fences: infected zone : buffer zone: surveillance zone : free zone

AB  - Objectives of this study were to establish GIS database essential to wildlife sanctuary management, to apply remote sensing data in the monitor of changes in land useto model suitable habitats and to analyze socio-economic information concerned. The study area, Phuluang Wildlife Sanctuary. (PLWS) Is located in Loei province, and cover an area of about 560,593 rais. This project is divided into 4 parts according to the nature of works and issues: GIS Forest change/remote sensing, models of suitable wildlife habitats and socio-economic information. Database establishment of the information collected was performed, this included spatial data and its associated attribute. The results obtained indicate a significant change of forest acreage between 1976-1998. The depletion in forest area by type from 1976 to 1888 was 50.72 percent. 47.08 percent and 8.37 percent for the dry evergreen, the dry dipterocarp and the hill evergreen respectively. Habitat suitability model for 9 wildlife species relevant to the PLWS was identified. The component models include forest type, topography, water source, salt lick and distance from human activity centres. Overlay analysis of these components using GIS provides identifying the most suitable and moderately suitable habitats. The most suitable areas are accounted 7.73 percent 7.24 percent, 1.71 percent and 1.36 for silver Pheasant, white-handed Gibbon Asiatic Black Bear and Red Dog respectively. The most suitable habitat for the rest species cover a small extent. Socio-economic analysis revealed that the majority of population (GT 70 percent) in the PLWS and 5 km buffer zone are engaged in agriculture. Farm and non-farm incomes were annually accounted for 63,337 baht/household. Over 80 percent of the households have a significant debt. Regarding the potential future landuse, illegal use of forest land for a number of reasons is a major cause of forest area depletion. Protection and conservation measures are major issues to be considered. The vas textent of the PLWS and a limited number of protection officials may have significant effects on the decrease of the forest area and wildlife species as well.

AB  - The Southern Study Area (SSA) report integrates the study area history, geology, and hydrology with the results of soil, surface water, ground water, air, biota, and structures investigations to define the nature and extent of contamination in the southern portion of RMA. The SSA includes all of sections 11 and 12 and portions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 7. Historic reports indicate that the SSA was not used for the production of agents or pesticides, but was a disposal area and buffer zone. 904 soil samples were analyzed as were surface water samples and ground water samples from numerous wells. Organochlorine pesticides and HG are the most commonly detected contaminants. The volume of potentially contaminated soil is estimated at 1.51 million cubic yards. This report is presented in three sections: characterization of the study area - geology, hydrology, climate history

AB  - Sampling activities conducted during this Environmental Investigation (EI) are summarized below: 1) Collection and analysis of soil, surface water/sediment, wipe, and radon samples from areas previously identified to be potential contamination sources; and 2) Collection and analysis of soil and surface water/sediment samples to define background levels of potential contaminants of concern. Areas of environmental significance at the Annex that were investigated during the course of this EI include the 136 storage igloos, the 5 loading ramps (3404 through 3408), the lone debris pile, 21 areas of ground disturbance, 4 "excavated" ponds, and 10 stream sampling stations. Two of these stream sampling locations were upstream for comparison to the 6 samples collected on the Annex and the 2 locations downstream of the Annex. A background surface water and sediment sample was collected from a wetland pond in the northeast buffer zone, which is of the same wetland class as the 4 "excavated" ponds, for comparison to the pond samples from on the Annex. Background soil samples were collected from 3 locations within the buffer zone for comparison to soil samples collected on the Annex.

AB  - After the first outbreak in Thailand caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1, the Department of Livestock Development (DLD) implemented a range of control measures, including culling (with compensation), movement restriction, improvements in hygiene and biosecurity, and an active surveillance programme (the “X-ray programme”). The DLD has also encouraged broiler chicken farmers to establish compartmentalised production systems, where biosecurity and surveillance measures are implemented within both the boundaries of the farm itself and within the surrounding 1km area around the farm (the ‘buffer zone’) to protect the health status of the farm’s chicken population. The use of compartmentalisation is not only a tool for prevention of HPAIV infection, but also creates disease free areas, allowing a continuation of trade activities. A qualitative risk assessment conducted as part of a larger project funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations assessed the risk of introduction and transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 into the 1-km buffer zones surrounding compartmentalised poultry farms in Thailand. The results indicated that a more detailed and quantitative risk assessment should be conducted focussing on risk pathways associated with backyard chickens and fighting cocks. Following discussions with the DLD, it was agreed to evaluate the risk of introducing HPAIV subtype H5N1 via cock fighting activities into the buffer zones surrounding compartmentalised broiler farms.

AB  - A study was conducted to determine the effects of different forest gap sizes on floristic composition in fragmented forest. Generally, fragmented forests are experiencing rapid nature and anthropogenic disturbances due to lack of buffer zone. These disturbances contribute to forest gap created at canopy level of fragmented forests. The forest succession and restoration also take major part of the ecosystem actively. Five study plots with the dimension 20 m x 20 m were established in Bangi Forest Reserve. The selection of study plots were made by following the assigned Forest Gap Index (FGI). The FGI is a qualitative monitoring based on the percentage of incident light entering the forest floor and crown openness. Five indicators have been used in FGI based on percentage of crown openness which were I (0 - 20%), II (21 - 40%), III (41 - 60%), IV (61 ¬80%) and V (81 - 100%). Tree inventory was conducted at each study plot where all trees ~ 1 cm in DBH (diameter at breast height) were recorded. The measurement has been made on the tree DBH and local coordinate of each recorded tree. The result shows that 670 individual trees from 49 families and 181 species were recorded at all study area (0.2 ha). All individual trees were identified up to species level. Multivariate analysis was constructed to determine the existence of tree species based on the applied FGI and to identify the dominant species. This analysis revealed that similarities between studied plots were due mainly to the successional stage of the fragmented forest community.

AB  - Eradication of invasive species is an important component for species conservation and ecosystem restoration. Success of eradications is dependent on knowledge of population connectivity in order to determine reinvasion pathways, and hence populations requiring simultaneous eradication (eradication units). The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was introduced into New Zealand from Australia and Tasmania, and now occupies a wide range of habitats across the majority of New Zealand. Possums are one of the most destructive invaders within New Zealand, with extensive control operations occurring throughout the country. Understanding the population connectivity of possums on mainland New Zealand (North and South Islands) will enhance the success of planned eradications. We examined the genetic population structure of invasive possums to identify gene flow, thus reinvasion pathways, between seven populations around Dunedin and on the Otago Peninsula where eradication of possums is occurring. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite loci was comparable between all sampled populations and exhibited a significant isolation by distance pattern. Bayesian clustering methods supported the existence of two population clusters, indicating the presence of a reinvasion pathway onto the Otago Peninsula from urban areas at the Southern end of the Peninsula. To avoid recolonisation, all possums on the Otago Peninsula should be eradicated simultaneously, with the implementation and ongoing maintenance and monitoring of an urban buffer zone. We recommend pre-eradication genetic analyses be adopted by all pest managers to define appropriate eradication units, thereby maximising eradication success and avoiding costly failures.

AB  - We studied two similar riparian sites in southern New England and examined ground water nitrate (NO(3-)-N) removal in the subsurface of mowed (i.e., herbaceous) vs. forested (i.e., woody) vegetation. Each site consisted of poorly drained, fine to medium sands and contained adjacent areas of mowed and forested vegetation. We dosed mesocosms with bromide and 15N labeled NO(3-)-N amended ground water to simulate the shallow ground water NO(3-)-N dynamics of riparian buffer zones. Mesocosms were composed of undisturbed, horizontal soil cores (40 cm long, 15 cm diam.) extracted from seasonally saturated subsoil. We observed substantial ground water NO(3-)-N removal and denitrification at all locations. Ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates were significantly correlated with carbon-enriched patches of organic matter. This correlation supports previous work that patches function as hotspots of microbial activity in the subsoil. Within each site, we found no significant difference in ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates in the subsoil of forested and mowed areas and we noted tree roots throughout the subsoil of the mowed areas. We found that ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates differed significantly between similar sites. We caution against ascribing specific ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates to different riparian aboveground vegetation types without recognizing the importance of site differences, e.g., water table dynamics, land use legacy and adjacent vegetation. Riparian zones composed of a mix of forested and mowed vegetation, common in agroforestry and suburban land uses, may remove substantial amounts of ground water NO(3-)-N.

AB  - Soil samples were collected from the top 7.5 cm of soil in a Strict Natural Reserve (SNR), a surrounding buffer zone, a cassava farm and matured plantations of Gmelina, teak, and pine, so as to determine if plantation establishment and intensive cultivation affect the density and diversity of soil mites. Altogether, 41 taxonomic groups of mites were identified. The diversity and densities of mites in within the SNR, the buffer zone and the Gmelina were more than the diversity and densities in the cassava farm, teak and pine plantations. Each plantation had its own unique community structure which was different from the community structure in the SNR plot. The SNR plot and Gmelina were dominated by detritivorous cryptostigmatid mites unlike teak and pine which were dominated by predatory mesostigmatid and prostigmatid mites respectively. Low cryptostigmatid mite densities in the plantations and cassava farm were seen as a consequence of low fertility status of the soil, the evidence of which was revealed by soil pH and organic matter data.

AB  - Technical interventions have not always led to expected outcomes when attempting to achieve a balanced growth between natural resource development and food production, particularly in the context of Third World countries. In Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) buffer zone, Nepal, farmers' perceptions were used to evaluate how irrigation resource development and the method of water sharing have increased household food security and reduced pressure on natural resources of the park. The findings indicate that with some variations between communities, increased water availability and reliability through irrigation development have improved crop diversity, cropping intensity, food sufficiency, and economic return to farmers. Community attributes such as leadership and dynamics were, among others, the decisive factors that determined the degree of success of the government development intervention programme in the buffer zone. Small landholders and low-income groups in dry areas perceived that they received greater benefits from micro-groundwater pumping schemes. However, many rural poor inhabitants in the area still lack access to these resource opportunities. We observed that Park and People, a government programme, successfully improved public relations and helped create awareness in this buffer zone. However, grievances persist among other water user groups in the upstream part of the Rapti River where a water-sharing mechanism needs to be defined between water user associations for crop production and maintenance of biodiversity of the national park.

AB  - An economic analysis of alternative forest harvesting systems was carried out in Peninsular Malaysia to evaluate and compare existing and improve harvesting systems in term of their costs, efficiency and productivity. The results showed that distance and number of logs were significantly related to delay-free cycle time in felling in the improved system while in the existing system only diameter was significantly related to time. In skidding, distance and log volume were significant both in the improve and existing systems. Logging cost excluding cost of premium, royalty and cess under the improve system was RM 232.11 per m3 or 180% higher than the cost of logging under the existing system of RM82.74 per m3. The increase in costs in the improved system is mainly due to the higher cost of buffer zone , road construction and repair and enforcement.The conservation costs constituted about 82% of the total cost in the improved system and about 48% in the existing system. Under average conditions, it takes 0.24 h to fell a tree under the improved system compared to 0.40 h under ther existing system. This suggest that the improvement made under the improved system has increased the productivity of felling.In skidding, it takes about 0.11 h to travel one round trip under the improved system compared to 0.20 h (simulated) under the existing system.This suggest that the improvement in road construction in the improved system has increased productivity of skidding. Under average conditions, the cost of felling and skidding were lower under the improved system as compared to the existing system (simulated). Simulating the improved systems, the cost of skidding were lower as compared with the existing system. Cost of sustainable forest management was analysed conceptually through analytical frameworkof incremental cost and financial analysis of complying to SFM. It is expected that the reduction in damage to the residual stand after logging will contribute to the higher net future harvests of timber.  It is expected that in the long run the SFM can be financially viable by incorporating the NTFP and environmental services other than timber revenue.

AB  - The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), is a key pest that causes reduction of the crop yield within the international fruit market. Fruit flies have been suppressed by two Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management programs in Thailand using Sterile Insect Technique (AW-IPM-SIT) since the late 1980s and the early 2000s. The projects' planning and evaluation usually rely on information from pest status, distribution, and fruit infestation. However, the collected data sometimes does not provide enough detail to answer management queries and public concerns, such as the long term sterilization efficacy of the released fruit fly, skepticism about insect migration or gene flow across the buffer zone, and the re-colonisation possibility of the fruit fly population within the core area. Established microsatellite DNA markers were used to generate population genetic data for the analysis of the fruit fly sampling from several control areas, and non-target areas, as well as the mass-rearing facility. The results suggested limited gene flow (m < 0.100) across the buffer zones between the flies in the control areas and flies captured outside. In addition, no genetic admixture was revealed from the mass-reared colony flies from the flies within the control area, which supports the effectiveness of SIT. The control pests were suppressed to low density and showed weak bottleneck footprints although they still acquired a high degree of genetic variation. Potential pest resurgence from fragmented micro-habitats in mixed fruit orchards rather than pest incursion across the buffer zone has been proposed. Therefore, a suitable pest control effort, such as the SIT program, should concentrate on the hidden refuges within the target area.

AB  - 1 We investigated, over the course of 2 years, the spatial distribution and abundance of two species of aphid, Metopolophium dirhodum and Sitobion avenae, and predatory species of carabid. This was undertaken in 24 wheat fields in ‘coarse‐grain’ and ‘fine‐grain’ landscapes in western France. A greater percentage of the latter landscape was covered by hedgerows and grassland and the total area covered by fields and the average size of the fields were smaller. 2 The effects on aphid abundance of the distance from field margins, the presence of grassy strips and carabid abundance were determined in both landscapes. 3 Both aphid species were more abundant in the ‘fine‐grain’ landscape, which may have been a result of the higher density of semi‐natural elements. In both types of landscape, the total numbers of aphids were negatively correlated with the distance from the field margin. This may have been because aphids were dispersing from overwintering sites in field margins. The abundance of M. dirhodum was strongly negatively correlated with the presence of grassy strips in the ‘coarse‐grain’ landscape, although there were no such significant correlations for either of the aphid species in the ‘fine‐grain’ landscape. 4 Aphid and carabid abundances were negatively correlated in the ‘fine‐grain’ and positively in ‘coarse‐grain’ landscape. 5 The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of semi‐natural areas in agricultural landscapes in shaping the spatial distribution of aphids and carabid beetles, their natural enemies, at different spatial scales.

AB  - The common nettle (Urtica dioica L.) is a perennial and cosmopolitan plant species and is known to be the source of food for a great diversity of insects. To understand the importance of the nettle in agro-ecosystems, a field experiment was carried out in an experimental farm at Gembloux (Belgium) to study the effect of nettle margin strips on aphid and aphidophagous populations in close field crops, namely wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), green pea (Pisum sativum L.) and rape (Brassicae napus L.). The aphids and related beneficial populations were weekly assessed, from March to August 2005, by visual observations in two plots per field crop. A higher abundance of aphidophagous beneficials was collected in nettle strips when compared to the field crops. Particularly, the presence of predatory anthocorids, mirids and green lacewings was observed on nettle only. Nevertheless, the most abundant aphid predatory family, the Coccinellidae, was distributed in both environments, in nettle strips and in crop fields. The field margin supported a significantly higher density of Harmonia axyridis than the field crops. In contrast, the field crops, green pea particularly, supported a higher density of Coccinella septempunctata. The distribution of the aphidophagous species, mainly the ladybirds, was discussed in relation to the host plant and related aphid species and their potential effect on integrated pest management.

AB  - Natal habitat use by dragonflies was assessed on an urban to rural land-use gradient at a set of 21 wetlands, during two emergence seasons (2004, 2005). The wetlands were characterized for urbanization level by using the first factor from a principal components analysis combining chloride concentration in the wetland and percent forest in the surrounding buffer zone. Measurements of species diversity and its components (species richness and evenness) were analyzed and compared along the urbanization gradient, as were distributions of individual species. Dragonfly diversity, species richness, and evenness did not change along the urbanization gradient, so urban wetlands served as natal habitat for numerous dragonfly species. However, several individual species displayed strong relationships to the degree of urbanization, and most were more commonly found at urban sites and at sites with fish. In contrast, relatively rare species were generally found at the rural end of the gradient. These results suggest that urban wetlands can play important roles as dragonfly habitat and in dragonfly conservation efforts, but that conservation of rural wetlands is also important for some dragonfly species.

AB  - The factors controlling NO3 removal in riparian buffer systems are poorly understood. We measured denitrification rates for two Coastal Plain, forested riparian zone soils: Kinston fine loamy sand (fine-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaquent) and Alapaha loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Plinthic Paleaquult). Kinston soils are more poorly drained and have higher organic matter than Alapaha soils. Surface soil and shallow aquifer samples were treated with solutions that contained chloramphenicol with either distilled water, NO3-N, glucose-C, or NO3, plus glucose. Denitrification potentials (N2O production in the presence of acetylene) were significantly higher in Kinston soil for both depths. Surface samples from both soils showed significant responses to NO3 additions but no response to C additions without NO3. Subsurface samples, taken from the top of the aquifer, showed no significant response to either NO3 or C treatments for either soil. Both soils showed a high degree of stratification within the top 10 cm, with 88 and 68% of denitrification potential in the top 2 cm for Alapaha and Kinston soils, respectively. Denitrification rates in cores were much lower than in slurries but rates in cores with NO3 or NO3-plus-glucose additions were significantly higher than unamended or C-amended cores for the Kinston soil. Although both soils respond to NO3 additions, Kinston soils are better able to reduce incoming NO3. These results indicate that denitrification in the shallow aquifer is a more important removal mechanism at the Kinston site than at the Alapaha site

AB  - Thinning of 30- to 70-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) stands is a common silvicultural activity on federal forest lands of the Pacific Northwest, United States. Empirical relationships among riparian functions, silvicultural treatments, and different riparian buffer widths are not well documented for small headwater streams. We investigated buffer width and density management effects on riparian microclimates of headwater streams in western Oregon. Spatial variations in stand density, canopy cover, and microclimate were measured along transects extending from stream center upslope into thinned stands, patch openings, or unthinned stands, with riparian buffers ranging from <5 m up to 150 m width. For treated stands, summer mean daily air and soil temperature maxima increased, and mean daily humidity minima decreased with distance from stream. Microclimate gradients were strongest within 10 m of stream center, a distinct area of stream influence within broader riparian areas. Thinning resulted in subtle changes in microclimate as mean air temperature maxima were 1 to 4 degrees C higher than in unthinned stands. With buffers 15 m or greater width, daily maximum air temperature above stream center was less than 1 degrees C greater, and daily minimum relative humidity was less than 5% lower than for unthinned stands. In contrast, air temperatures were significantly warmer within patch openings (+6 to +9 degrees C), and within buffers adjacent to patch openings (+3 degrees C) than within unthinned stands. Buffers of widths defined by the transition from riparian to upland vegetation or topographic slope breaks appear sufficient to mitigate the impacts of upslope thinning on the microclimate above headwater streams.

AB  - The combined effectiveness of thinning and riparian buffers for increasing structural complexity while maintaining riparian function in second-growth forests is not well documented. We surveyed down wood and vegetation cover along transects from stream center, through buffers ranging from <5 to 150 m width into thinned stands, patch openings, or unthinned stands of 40- to 65-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests in western Oregon, USA. Small-wood cover became more homogeneous among stream reaches within 5 years following thinning, primarily due to decreases for reaches having the greatest pretreatment abundance. Mean shrub cover converged, predominantly because of decreases in patch openings. Herbaceous cover increased, particularly in patch openings. Relative to unthinned stands, herbaceous cover was similar in wide buffers and increased in the narrowest buffers and in narrow buffers adjacent to patch openings. Moss cover tended to increase in thinned areas and decrease in patch openings. Both conventional point-null hypothesis tests and inequivalence tests suggested that wood and vegetation responses within buffers of ≥15 m width were insensitive to the treatments. However, inherently conservative equivalence tests infrequently inferred similarity between thinned stands or buffers and untreated stands. Difficulties defining ecologically important effect size can limit the inferential utility of equivalence–inequivalance testing.

AB  - Ecologists increasingly recognise the importance of spatial scale for conservation. This study focuses on threatened temporary wetland crustaceans, the fairy shrimp Branchinecta orientalis Sars (Anostraca) and the tadpole shrimp Triops cancriformis Bosc (Notostraca). Using redundancy analyses with a canonical variance partitioning approach, we studied how local habitat conditions and landscape features influence their densities at 4 spatial scales (100m buffer strip around ponds, 1km, 5km and 10km catchment scales). Branchinecta densities were negatively related with local conditions (trophic status) at all scales. Landscape effects (catchment:wetland size ratio) were only significant at the 10km scale. However, trophic state conditions were influenced by local contamination rather than landscape conditions. Local degradation tended to be more pronounced in wetlands situated in catchments with a higher cover of natural vegetation compared to those in agricultural catchments. Triops was less influenced by local effects at all scales. The importance of landscape effects increased with landscape scale but effects were only significant at the 10km scale, and were negatively explained by irrigated croplands. The importance of broad landscape scales and the difficulty to restore locally degraded sites challenges management. Because rationalisation of large-scale agricultural practises can conflict with socioeconomic demands, a first step to the conservation of actual Branchiopoda populations in this remnant wetland complex could benefit from the creation of vegetated buffer strips around the wetlands and/or hedgerows around agricultural fields to counteract atmosphere-mediated flux of particles and solutes from croplands to wetlands at broad landscape scales.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution, which contributes to contamination of surface waters, is difficult to control. Some pollutants, particularly nitrate (NO₃⁻), are predominantly transmitted through ground water. Riparian buffer zones have the potential to remove contaminants from ground water and reduce the amount of NO₃⁻ that enters surface water. This is a justification for setting aside vegetated buffer strips along waterways. Many riparian zone hydrologic models assume uniform ground-water flow through organic-rich soil under reducing conditions, leading to effective removal of ground-water NO₃⁻ prior to discharge into a stream. However, in a small first-order stream in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain, base-flow generation was highly variable (spatially and temporally). Average base-flow NO₃⁻ loads were greater in winter than summer, and higher during a wetter year than in dryer years. Specific sections of the stream consistently received greater amounts of high NO₃⁻ ground water than others. Areas within the riparian zone responsible for most of the NO₃⁻ exported from the watershed are termed "critical areas." Over this 5-year study, most of the NO₃⁻ exported during base flow originated from a critical area comprising less than 10% of the total riparian zone land area. Allocation of resources to address and improve mitigation function in critical areas should be a priority for continued riparian zone research.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips are considered to provide natural remediation for groundwater contaminants, but this function is partly based on a relatively simple model of riparian zone hydrology; specifically, horizontal matrix flow through the shallow subsurface. Deviation from horizontal flow leads to asymmetrical groundwater emergence onto the surface and greater propensity for contaminant delivery to the stream. The study site, at the USDA-Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, is in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain of Maryland. The site contains a small first-order stream that is instrumented with five stations for monitoring stream flow and chemistry, and 170 nested piezometers (mostly in transects) for evaluating groundwater hydrology and geochemistry. Subsurface microstratigraphy and macroporosity are largely responsible for observed spatial and temporal variations in groundwater contributions to the stream. The portion of the stream that shows the highest rate of flow increase per stream length contains discrete zones of enhanced groundwater discharge (upwelling) to the surface, which supply most of the additional stream flow. These upwelling zones display high (positive) vertical hydraulic heads, which relate to the amount of groundwater discharged from those points. One particular area of intense groundwater upwelling supplies approximately 4% of the total stream outflow, yet comprises only 0.006% of the riparian zone. The upwelling zones also supply most of the NO3(-) to the surface. Zones of focused groundwater exfiltration that sustain stream baseflow do not correspond with erosional features, and have a great impact on stream flow characteristics and NO3(-) behavior. Few studies to date have elucidated and quantified contributions from specific surface features (e.g. upwelling zones, discharging macropores). More emphasis and research needs to be directed to the importance of focused groundwater exfiltration points for stream flow generation and NO3(-) transport, with the goal of devising more effective management regulations for preserving and enhancing riparian zone mitigation function.

AB  - Samar, the third largest island in the Philippine archipelago, has a total land area of 13,458 sq km. Recent satellite images showed that a large portion of the remaining forest blocks on the island had long since been cleared for agriculture and from continued illegal logging activities. For Samar to be declared a natural park, Ragub (DENR-PAWB/SIBP) led a biological resource assessment of the eight watersheds making up Samar Island Natural Park (SINP), for a comprehensive database. Specifically, the status of floral resources in terms of their taxonomy, distribution, plant diversity level, potential uses, and conservation status was evaluated. The project was implemented from August 2002 to July 2003. The total plant diversity of the Samar Island Natural Park was composed of 974 species distributed in 436 genera and 131 families. As to habitat composition, the entire SINP had a total of 55 species of epiphytes, 103 ferns, 146 herbs, 76 lianas or woody vines, 56 shrubs, 165 small trees, 230 medium-sized trees, 100 large trees, 36 tree-like plants and 39 vines. The potential and/or actual economic uses of the 974 plant taxa can be broken down into 49 for cottage industry, 9 fruit crops/trees; 28 with edible fruits; 3 fiber sources; 413 landscape materials; 24 medicinal; 14 poison source; 1 shampoo source; 5 vegetables; 212 ornamentals; 1 pulp fiber source; 3 root crops; 2 spices; 19 weeds; 2 soil erosion control; 10 ecological functions; and 262 species as source of timber. The biological assessment data showed that a relatively high biodiversity level was present in each of eight watersheds and these watersheds have unique combination of ecosystems that should also be conserved wisely and managed beneficially. On floristic value, a number of new species records were made. One important taxonomic and biogeographic discovery was made in the Suribao watershed, particularly in the vicinity of Mt. Apoy in Brgy. [village] Benowangan, Borongan, Eastern Samar. Falcatifolium gruezoi de Laub., (Podocarpaceae) known locally as 'karis-karis' in Waray, 'binaton in Tagalog, and Gruezo sickle-leaf in English was discovered. Its discovery represented a new forest type termed as mixed Falcatifolium forest. This can only be found in a specific habitat type described as new under the name pseudo-peat swamp. The discovery of another species of conifer, Podocarpus rumphjii ('malakawayan', podocarpaceae) brought the total number of conifer species in Samar Island to five; with this particular species as an example of a new species record for the island. Such floral diversity presents a great potential for the ornamentals/landscape industry. The entire SINP is a broad composite of the following ecosystems: grasslands, agroforestry areas, forest-over-limestone, riparian ecosystem, lowland mixed dipterocarp forest, and mossy or cloud forest. The study highly recommends the completion at the soonest possible time of the perimeter survey of each of the eight SINP watershed. A number of special habitats that was within the buffer zone has to be marked clearly for inclusion to the respective watersheds. Likewise, plant species with special habitat requirement should be marked on the ground within and outside of the watershed perimeter. The transplanting of wildlings in appropriate localities should be made a priority particularly for sensitive and/or highly endangered taxa. The regular monitoring and evaluation of randomly chosen ecosystems within SINP is also recommended with time interval of 7 years.

AB  - Surface waters are complex ecosystem with chemical, biological and physical processes that interact with each other. A change in any of these processes affects the delicate balance with other processes and ultimately results in changes to the ecosystem. To complement the information on the biological characteristics of the river and the socioeconomic features of the surrounding communities, Seronay (NORMISIST) assessed the Langaran and Layawan Rivers. The Layawan River was awarded the 'cleanest and the greenest' river in Region 10 suggesting that its water quality surpasses any river based on some water quality standards. Langaran River, on the other hand, was shown to have poor water quality downstream based on biological indicators. Through the study, the physicochemical parameters (concentration of nitrate/phosphate [NH4], dissolved oxygen, ph, etc.) and river discharge in different sampling stations of the rivers were measured and compared during the dry and wet season. Langaran River had much better water quality in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and phosphate level than Layawan River. The TDS and conductivity in Layawan River were significantly higher than Langaran River during dry season.  High conductivity value was often associated with increased soil erosion and conductivity was also directly related to TDS. In Layawan River, the parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS) level, TDS load, and NH4 load increased significantly from upstream to downstream stations during dry season. In Langaran river, the parameters that exhibited a significant increase towards the downstream stations were TSS level, TDS load, and conductivity during dry season while river discharge and NH4 level increased during the wet season. These results were within the DENR standards of water quality. Comparing the assessment results with water quality criteria/water usage and classification for fresh water system of DENR, both the Layawan and Langaran Rivers can be utilized mainly for recreation such as bathing and swimming (Recreational Water Class 1). Impacts of the study showed the need for an annual systematic monitoring of water parameters in Layawan and Langaran rivers. Also, information dissemination on the Clean Water Act especially to the communities living near the river bank should be intensified. The study further recommends that a 20-m strip of land along the edge of normal high waterline river buffer zone be established in both rivers to improve water quality.

AB  - Mediterranean rivers in the Iberian Peninsula are being increasingly affected by human activities, which threaten their ecological status. A clear picture of how do these multiple stressors affect river ecosystem functioning is still lacking. We addressed this question by measuring a key ecosystem process, namely breakdown of organic matter, at 66 sites distributed across Mediterranean Spain. We performed breakdown experiments by measuring the mass lost by wood sticks for 54 to 106days. Additionally, we gathered data on physico-chemical, biological and geomorphological characteristics of study sites. Study sites spanned a broad range of environmental characteristics and breakdown rates varied fiftyfold across sites. No clear geographic patterns were found between or within basins. 90th quantile regressions performed to link breakdown rates with environmental characteristics included the following 7 variables in the model, in decreasing order of importance: altitude, water content in phosphorus, catchment area, toxicity, invertebrate-based biotic index, riparian buffer width, and diatom-based quality index. Breakdown rate was systematically low in high-altitude rivers with few human impacts, but showed a high variability in areas affected by human activity. This increase in variability is the result of the influence of multiple stressors acting simultaneously, as some of these can promote whereas others slow down the breakdown of organic matter. Therefore, stick breakdown gives information on the intensity of a key ecosystem process, which would otherwise be very difficult to predict based on environmental variables.

AB  - Despite widespread adoption of conservation practices by farmers in the Cannonsville watershed, part of the New York City water supply system, there is considerable resistance to riparian buffer practices of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Traditional approaches to promoting CREP adoption, based on the adoption-diffusion model, were not effective in promoting CREP. We surveyed farmers in the Cannonsville watershed to evaluate factors affecting CREP adoption. Many variables commonly tied to practice adoption, including farm structure and farmer sociodemographic traits, were poorly correlated with the attitudes of Cannonsville farmers toward CREP. Attitudes toward land costs and farmer resentment toward New York City's control of land and conservation policy were, however, strong predictors of CREP adoption. This suggests that as regional watershed collaborations become more active in managing private landowner conservation behaviors, resentment factors may inhibit adoption of the encouraged practices. Findings provide insight into mechanisms to improve upstream-downstream partnerships and the potential to balance clean water resources with local agricultural production priorities.

AB  - Forest land managers are concerned about the effects of logging on soil erosion, streamflow, and water quality and are promoting the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control impacts. To compare the effects of BMP implementation on streamwater quality, two of three small watersheds in Kentucky were harvested in 1983 and 1984, one with BMPs, the other without BMPs. There was no effect of clearcutting on stream temperatures. Streamflow increased by 17.8 cm (123 percent) on the BMP watershed during the first 17 months after cutting and by 20.6 cm (138 percent) on the Non-BMP watershed. Water yields remained significantly elevated compared to the uncut watershed 8 years after harvesting. Suspended sediment flux was 14 and 30 times higher on the BMP and Non-BMP Watersheds, respectively, than on the uncut watershed during treatment, and 4 and 6.5 times higher in the 17 months after treatment was complete. Clearcutting resulted in increased concentrations of nitrate, and other nutrients compared to the uncut watershed, and concentrations were highest on the non-BMP watershed. Recovery of biotic control over nutrient losses occurred within three years of clearcutting. The streamside buffer strip was effective in reducing the impact of clearcutting on water yield and sediment flux

AB  - Field margin plots, sown with either a simple grass mix, a complex grass mix with or without forbs or allowed to regenerate naturally were established around four fields on the Royal Agricultural College's Harnhill farm in the west of England. Two of the fields were managed conventionally and two were managed organically. Plants and invertebrates were recorded on the margin plots over a 2 year period to test the influence of the different mixtures on the community assemblages. There was no difference in the seed bank of the different plot types, however the organically managed margins contained more unsown species than the conventionally managed margins. The simple mix plots had significantly fewer plant species than the other plots. The naturally regenerating plots had significantly lower grass cover and grass species diversity than the other plots. In the second year perennial grass and perennial forb cover increased in all mixtures. Both the cover and numbers of unsown species were reduced in the sown plots in the second year. Percentage cover and species richness of forbs were significantly higher in the complex grass with forbs and naturally regenerating plots. Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera and Araneae abundance were significantly correlated with plant species richness. Also, both plant species richness and total plant cover significantly influenced the Auchenorrhyncha community. Invertebrate abundance was greater in the organically managed plots than in the conventional ones, except larval Coleoptera. In the second year significantly more predatory Coleoptera species were trapped in the natural regeneration plots. Farming system and field crop type influenced the Coleoptera communities, phytophagous Coleopteran diversity being significantly correlated with plant diversity. Sowing field margins with a complex seed mixture with some forb species and managing the field with reduced inputs suppressed undesirable plant species and increased invertebrate abundance and diversity. A mixture containing forbs increased plant species richness and maximised heterogeneity of the margin, providing a more diverse habitat for invertebrates.

AB  - We used landscape ecology concepts to test the importance of upland-wetland linkages on the distribution of two common wetland species, the northern watersnake Nerodia sipedon sipedon and midland painted turtle Chrysemys picta marginata, and two rare wetland species, the copper-bellied watersnake Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta and Blanding's turtle Emydoidea blandingii. We tested if connectivity (proximity to other wetlands), connectivity quality (wetland distance to roads and forest area within 30, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 m of the wetland), and patch size (wetland size and shoreline length) affected the distribution of these four species. Our results show that both common species were more likely to occur in larger, less isolated wetlands, but their distribution were not influenced by proximity to roads or the amount of adjacent forest area surrounding the wetland. Both rare species were more likely to occur in wetlands that were farther away from roads and that had more surrounding forest. Proximity to other wetlands was not a significant predictor of either rare species' distribution. Our results suggest that management practices should focus on protecting wetland complexes and maintaining upland-wetland linkages by improving landscape connectivity, increasing forest area surrounding wetlands and reducing road effects.

AB  - This study examines the ecology and dynamics of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in environments experimentally altered by logging. The objective was to evaluate processes that stabilize or regulate the populations. Two small watersheds in Oregon's Coast Range were logged in1966, one clear-cut, the other patch-cut. A third adjacent watershed was left uncut as a control. The influence of these treatments on the biology of the coho was assessed. Attention was concentrated on populations of the six year classes 1963 to 1968. The natural variability of streamflow-related conditions influencing both the magnitude and pattern of coho recruitment each year was increased in the logged watersheds. Peak flow during storms increased; intragravel dissolved oxygen levels decreased in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. These changes, however, were apparently within the range of variation that the coho naturally experience. Increased stream temperatures and mortalities, due to the logging effects, altered the post-recruitment life conditions of the coho in that stream but did not significantly affect the final smolt yield. The nocturnal behavior of recently emerged fry leads to recruitment along the stream length. Fry tend to emerge en masse from the redds at night, and large numbers proceed immediately to disperse downstream. This migration continues for several successive nights, beginning each night soon after dark. Evidence is presented indicating that fry emigration is primarily a dispersal mechanism that distributes fry from redd sites to nursery areas. It is hypothesized that the series of events leading from fry dispersal to be quiescent behavior at night, characteristic of resident fry, is a developmental sequence involving the physiology and maturity of the fry, modified by agonistic activity. Adjustments in coho population size were largely accomplished by fall, resulting in stable and characteristic population levels in eachstream. A stable smolt yield was a further result. These adjustments are accomplished through high mortality during the months of the first spring and summer. This mortality is likely density dependent and related to the territorial and agonistic behavior of the fish. Growth, biomass, and net production varied greatly during each year. Seasonal changes in growth rate resulted in seasonal variations in biomass that were in contrast to the stabilized trends of population number. The pattern of net production rate was also largely determined by the seasonal growth pattern, and like biomass, did not show: a tendency to stabilize with time. It averaged 5 g/m² among the three streams for the period June 1 to April 15. The coho populations seem naturally regulated most importantly with respect to number. The patterns of biomass and rate of netproduction may be understood as an interaction of seasonally variable growth rate with stabilizing population numbers. This study has shown that coho streams normally produce characteristic levels of smolt yield in spite of large natural variations in fry input and conditions for growth. The range of environmental variation for which this result holds may include short-term changes due to logging. However a normal population response to such a severe alteration as occurred on Needle Branch is very likely conditional upon a program that at least includes vigorous stream clearance, the restriction of additional mortality to early summer, when population adjustments are far from complete, and the encouragement of streamside revegetation. A streamside buffer strip of trees is an effective way of protecting aquatic resources.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are interfaces between aquatic and terrestrial environments recognized for their nutrient interception potential in agricultural landscapes. Stream network maps from a broad range of map resolutions have been employed in watershed studies of riparian areas. However, map resolution may affect important attributes of riparian buffers, such as the connectivity between source lands and small stream channels missing in coarse resolution maps. We sought to understand the influence of changing stream map resolution on measures of the river network, near-stream land cover, and riparian metrics. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate the influence of stream map resolution on measures of the stream network, the character and extent of near-stream zones, and riparian metrics; (2) to compare patterns of variation among different physiographic provinces; and (3) to explore how predictions of nutrient retention potential might be affected by the resolution of a stream map. We found that using fine resolution stream maps significantly increased our estimates of stream order, drainage density, and the proportion of watershed area occurring near a stream. Increasing stream map resolution reduced the mean distance to source areas as well as mean buffer width and increased the frequency of buffer gaps. Measures of percent land cover within 100 m of streams were less sensitive to stream map resolution. Overall, increasing stream map resolution led to reduced estimates of nutrient retention potential in riparian buffers. In some watersheds, switching from a coarse resolution to a fine resolution stream map completely changed our perception of a stream network from well buffered to largely unbuffered. Because previous, broad-scale analyses of riparian buffers used coarse-resolution stream maps, those studies may have overestimated landscape-level buffer prevalence and effectiveness. We present a case study of three watersheds to demonstrate that interactions among stream map resolution and land cover patterns make a dramatic difference in the perceived ability of riparian buffers to ameliorate effects of agricultural activities across whole watersheds. Moreover, stream map resolution affects inferences about whether retention occurs in streams or riparian zones.

AB  - Data extracted from the 1968 records of the Climatological Research Station of the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, were analysed to assess the effect of the climatic factors: wind speed, soil temperature, mean air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and sunshine hours, on evaporation (Eo)and potential evapotranspiration (PE) at Ibadan. Net solar radiation and mean air temperature were highly correlated with Eo and PE, indicating that these two climatic factors are the most important affecting evapotranspiration at Ibadan. Of all the climatic factors, wind speed was the only one that was weakly correlated with Eo and PE. There was low correlation between Eo, PE and the Gunn-Bellani radiation data possibly because of the lag ffectintroducedby the instrument between actual heating and distillation. All the climatic parameters taken together were significantly correlated with measured PE (+0'82), Eofrom the sunken pan (+0·64) and Eofrom the classA pan (+0'80). These multiple correlation coefficients leave residual values between 33% and 60 %, suggesting that class A and sunken Eo pans as well as the Garniertype evapotranspirometers are not adequate for determining Eo and PE at Ibadan. The application of a constant (0,86) to Eo pan data is suggested, while the installation of bigger size evapotranspirometers, and an increase in the "buffer zone" to minimize the "oasis effect" would add more to the accuracy of the data obtained.

AB  - At present on territory of the buffer zone two types of the land use are conducted: agricultural and nature protection. Territorial differentiation of the buffer zone is conditioned by relief, ground, vegetation and system of the land use. The highest degree of the negative influence on biological ecosystems are land reclamation of bogs and agricultural use. The lowering of the negative influence of the agriculture on biodiversity are possible to reach by ecologization. The basic methods of the ecologization are offered. Now one of the leading branches in territory of a security zone "Belavezhskaya pushcha" is the agricultural production with a cattle-breeding bias. A ultimate goal of the present researches is the establishment of optimum land use structure  which could support to the full and keep a biodiversity of ecosystems of dense forests ecosystem long enough

AB  - This study points out that hydroelectric   plants will continue to play a prominent role in the   Brazilian electric matrix. A significant portion of the   potential hydroelectric plants of the country is located in   the Amazon, environmentally sensitive region. The licensing   of hydroelectric projects in Brazil is considered a major   obstacle for the expanding the capacity of generating   electricity. The non-expansion, in turn, represents a   serious threat to economic growth. This study, designed as a   contribution to the debate in progress about the subject,   examines the legal and institutional milestones of the   environmental licensing of hydroelectric ventures, including   studies of selected cases, an assessment of transaction   costs of the processes and a comparison with international   practices. Two conclusions emerge from this study. The first   is that the costs of dealing with environmental issues and   social development of enterprises hydroelectric in Brazil   represent 12 percent of the total cost of the work. And the   second is that costs of taxes, in general, the contractual   and regulatory uncertainty, excluding the licensing   environmental, represent about 7.5 percent of the total   cost. In other words, the conclusion is clear: the   environmental and social costs can be easily integrated.   This study does not suggest radical changes to the system of   environmental licensing. Any reform of the Brazilian   environmental licensing can not be dealt with based on a   single, simple solution. Rather, the system is complex and   multifaceted, with a long legal and institutional history. A   process of broad national discussion on the energy issue and   its implications for environmental goods of the country is   essential and is already in progress.

AB  - The Zambezi River Basin (ZRB) is one of   the most diverse and valuable natural resources in Africa.   Its waters are critical to sustainable economic growth and   poverty reduction in the region. The overall objective of   the Zambezi River Multi-Sector Investment   Opportunity Analysis (MSIOA) is to illustrate the benefits   of cooperation among the riparian countries in the ZRB   through a multi-sectoral economic evaluation of water   resources development, management options and scenarios from   both national and basin-wide perspectives. Better management   and cooperative development of the Basin's water   resources could significantly increase agricultural yields,   hydropower outputs, and economic opportunities.   Collaboration has the potential to increase the efficiency   of water use, strengthen environmental sustainability,   improve regulation of the demands made on natural resources,   and enable greater mitigation of the impact of droughts and   floods. Seen in this light, cooperative river basin   development and management not only provide a mechanism for   increasing the productivity and sustainability of the river   system, but also provide a potential platform for   accelerated regional economic growth, cooperation, and   stability within the wider Southern Africa Development   Community (SADC).

AB  - The Latin America and Caribbean Region   has been at the forefront of global biodiversity   conservation, dedicating 20 percent of its land to protected   areas compared to 13 percent in the rest of the developing   world. This progress has stretched available budgets for   conservation with estimates indicating that a twofold   increase would be necessary to achieve optimal management of   existing protected areas based on 2008 data. Recognizing the   importance of this financing challenge, this document   presents examples of how the region is successfully   exploring news ways and sources of finance for biodiversity   conservation. It is intended as an input to the global   discussions on biodiversity financing drawing from a   selective review of concrete experiences where governments   are tapping nonpublic finance sources in effective   partnerships. The cases reviewed point to common features   contributing to their success: (i)  variety in arrangements;   (ii)  enabling legal and institutional support; (iii)   capacity based on record of experience; (iv) building social   capital; (v) clarity about conservation objectives; (vi)   strong government leadership in guiding biodiversity   conservation policies and programs.

AB  - Rezultāti, kas tika iegūti, analizējot melno graudu izplatību rudzu ražošanas sējumos ir pretrunīgi. Tomēr ir novērotas dažas tendences: tīrumos, kur atzalu līmenis bija augstāks, novērots būtiski vairāk sklerociju; lauku malās (tieši pie malas) ir vairāk sklerociju, nekā lauka vidū, it īpaši, ja rudzu lauka malā ir nepļautas ceļmalas vai citi apstākļi, kas veicina infekcijas materiāla uzkrāšanos. Šis malas efekts izteikts atkārtotos rudzu sējumos vai pēc Claviceps purpurea saimniekaugiem. Melno graudu izplatību ietekmē rudzu un tritikāles sējumu biezība. Retākos sējumos melno graudu skaits lauka malās būtiski neatšķiras, bet lauka vidū izretotos sējumos melno graudu izplatība ir lielāka. Veicot melno graudu izplatības novērtēšanu ražošanas laukos un šķirņu salīdzināšanas rudzu un tritikāles sējumos (gan dabiskās, gan mākslīgās infekcijas fonā), netika konstatētas būtiskas atšķirības starp šķirnēm. Tomēr ir novērota tendence, ka hibrīdās un tetraploīdās šķirnes inficējas vairāk, tas ir saistīts ar ziedputekšņu morfoloģiju un veidošanās īpatnībām.

AB  - Naturally occurring riparian filter strips are widely recommended as a technique for removing chemicals from flow prior to entering a stream. Data on their effectiveness is sparse as is information on the partitioning of chemicals trapped by various mechanisms in these strips. Studies were conducted on the effectiveness of natural riparian grass buffer strips in removing sediment, atrazine, nitrogen and phosphorus from surface runoff. The strips were located in a karst watershed. No-till and conventional-tillage erosion plots served as the sediment and chemical source area. Runoff from the plots was directed onto 4.57, 9.14, and 13.72 m filter strips where the inflow and outflow concentrations and flow rates were measured. Trapping percentages for sediment and chemicals typically ranged above 90%. An evaluation was made of the distribution of trapped chemicals among infiltrated mass and mass stored in the surface layer. The analysis showed that most of the chemicals were trapped by infiltration into the soil matrix and that trapping efficiency increased with filter strip length and with fraction of water infiltrated

AB  - Concentrations of pesticides in streams draining 20 plantations of Eucalyptus nitens in Tasmania were examined in relation to buffer strip width. Atrazine concentrations on the day of spray in streams draining 15 plantations were significantly negatively correlated with riparian buffer strip width but not buffer quality. Concentrations following the first rain event and one month after spraying were highly positively correlated with day of spray concentration and were only weakly correlated with other site characteristics. Streams with 30 m buffer strips had median atrazine concentrations less than 20 microg per L at all times and these buffer widths are recommended for minimising short term ecological impact on streams. In streams draining 5 plantations that were aerially sprayed with the pyrethroids alpha- or cypermethrin, pyrethroid concentration and short term changes in drift (downstream movement) of stream invertebrates were highly negatively correlated with buffer strip width but with no other variable. Drift of stream invertebrates is recommended as a biomonitor for the contamination of streams with pyrethroids on the day of spray, sensitive down to 0.1 microg per L. Buffer strips of at least 50 m are recommended to minimize mortality of stream invertebrates from pyrethroid spraying.

AB  - The ability of the aphid pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis to remain active in the absence of a resting stage through a combination of continuous infection and as conidia deposited on soil was assessed alongside the potential for planted field margins to act as a refuge for the fungus. P. neoaphidis was able to infect the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, when maintained under controlled conditions that simulated those that occur seasonally in the UK. Although there was a significant inverse relationship between temperature and time-to-kill, with death occurring after 4.2, 6.9 and 13.6 days when maintained under fluctuating summer, autumn and winter temperatures, respectively, there were no additional statistically significant effects of photoperiod. The activity of inoculum on soil was indirectly assessed by baiting with A. pisum. Under controlled conditions P. neoaphidis remained active on soil and was able to infect aphids for up to 80 days. However, the percentage of aphids that became infected decreased from 76% on day 1 to 11% on day 80. Whereas there was little difference in the activity of conidia that had been maintained at 4 °C and 10 °C, activity at 18 °C was considerably reduced. Under field conditions the activity of inoculum was strongly influenced by season. On day 49 there was little or no activity during spring, summer or winter. However, during autumn a mean proportion of 0.08 aphids still became infected with P. neoaphidis. Margin type did not affect the activity of conidia nor was there a difference in activity between blocks that had regenerated naturally and those that had been planted. These results suggest that P. neoaphidis can infect aphids and remain active on soil under the abiotic conditions that occur seasonally in the UK and that this fungus may be able to persist annually without a resting stage.

AB  - Coexistence among genetically modified (GM) and non-GM cropping systems and identity preservation at the field level are increasingly important issues in many countries. Different types of pollen-mediated gene flow (cross-fertilization) models have been released during the past decade, primarily as a decision-support tool to achieve the European Union (EU) 0.9% GM adventitious presence (AP) labelling threshold for food and feed. We review key empirical or mechanistic models for four diverse crop types--canola or oilseed rape (OSR) (Brassica napus L.), maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.). Their strengths, weaknesses, relevance, and utility in simulating pollen-mediated gene flow are examined. Many empirical models simulate gene flow well, although their utility is often restricted by datasets with limited environmental variability or spatial scale. Few mechanistic models have been developed, reflecting the challenge in accurately simulating pollen-mediated gene flow by wind or insects; such models have not been validated for commercial field scenarios. Many models tend to provide upper-end or worst-case outcrossing predictions and management recommendations, either because of experimental design underlying datasets, biological and environmental stochasticity, or chosen statistical analysis. Both experimental results and modelling predictions of outcrossing in OSR, maize, and wheat reveal that isolation distance or a pollen barrier (buffer zone) generally is only recommended between small grain maize fields (ca. <5ha) to maintain field-average AP due to pollen-mediated gene flow below the EU threshold. Recent advances in modelling pollen-mediated gene flow in commercial fields are encouraging, but simulating gene flow in heterogeneous landscapes remains an elusive goal. Moreover, practical, user-friendly decision-support tools are needed to inform and guide farmers in implementing coexistence measures.

AB  - The proportion of N from crop residues entering the light-fraction organic matter (LFOM) pool was investigated in soils with contrasting soil organic matter and microbial characteristics arising from different management histories. A laboratory experiment was conducted in which ¹⁵N-labelled sugar beet, Brussels sprout or ryegrass shoots, which possessed a range of C/N contents, and hence different biochemical qualities, were incorporated into a sandy-loam soil collected from within a field (FC) or from the field margin (FM). Amounts of C and N incorporated into LFOM were determined after 112 days. The FC and FM soils had organic C contents of 0.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Addition of crop residues increased total LFOM N content and reduced its C/N in FC soil but had no effect on total LFOM N or its C/N in FM soil. Ryegrass incorporation into FC was the only treatment in which there was a net increase in LFOM C. Isotopic analysis indicated that more crop-residue-derived N became incorporated into the LFOM N pool in FM relative to FC soil, with per cent crop residue N incorporated ranging from 25.9% to 35.3% in FC and between 38.9 and 68.5 in FM. Incorporation of crop residues had a positive priming effect on pre-existing LFOM N in FM but not FC soil. We conclude that the characteristics of plant material, together with differences in soil organic matter and microbiology resulting from contrasting management, determined the amount of crop residue C and N incorporated into both HFOM and LFOM.

AB  - The fate of the herbicide isoproturon [3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] was investigated in soil from a grassed buffer strip. Compared to a cropped soil originating from the same experimental site (Kd = 1.8 L kg-1), sorption of isoproturon was enhanced in the grassed soil and especially in the surface layer (0-2 cm) containing a high proportion of nondecomposed plant residues (Kd= 5.0 L kg-1). Nonhumified organic fractions isolated from the surface soil layer and corresponding to above and below-ground plant residues derived from the grass exhibited high sorption coefficients Kd and Koc compared to the rest of the soil. Reversibility of sorption was lower in the grassed soil than in the cropped soil and decreased rapidly with time. A rapid degradation of isoproturon was observed at different depths of the grassed soil whereas most of the herbicide remained nondegraded in the cultivated soil: half-lives were respectively 72 d in the cultivated soil, and only 8 d in the superficial layer (0-2 cm) of the grassed soil. The highest mineralization rate of the isoproturon ring (20% after 35 d) was observed in the top layer (0-2 cm) having the highest mineralization rates of organic matter. In relation with this fast degradation a large proportion of isoproturon residues became nonavailable to water and methanol extractions (54% of the initial applied isoproturon found as nonextractable (bound) residues). Thus the grassed strip surface soil had a high potential to dissipate isoproturon trapped from run-off.

Apres application de 14C-isoproturon, les colonnes ont ete incubees pendant 44 j, puis ont subi une percolation de 15 j. Des colonnes non-incubees ont ete eluees de facon identique apres application d'herbicide. La mise en incubation des colonnes reduit fortement la lixiviation de l'isoproturon. Pour le sol enherbe, le taux de recuperation dans les solutions percolees passe de 30 % de l'herbicide applique sans incubation a 4 % apres incubation. Par rapport au sol cultive, la lixiviation de l'isoproturon est moindre dans le sol enherbe alors que sa degradation et la formation de residus lies sont fortement augmentees. Apres incubation et percolation, 90 % de la radioactivite appliquee reste dans les colonnes, majoritairement localisee dans les premiers 2 cm du sol enherbe (60 %)

AB  - In spatial analyses of causes or health effects of environmental pollutants, small units of analyses are usually preferred for internal environmental homogeneity reasons but can only be done when fine resolution data are available for most units. Objectives of this study were to determine which land use practices were spatially associated with ground water nitrate concentrations across Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, and which spatial aggregation is the preferred unit of analyses. Nitrate concentrations were determined for 4855 samples from private wells. Validated field-by-field land use data were available. Average nitrate concentration and percentage of area for the 14 major land use categories in PEI were determined for each of three spatial aggregations: watersheds based on topography and hydrology; freeform polygon boundaries based on similar neighboring nitrate concentrations; and 500-m buffer zones around each well. Results showed that the percentages of potato, grain, and hay coverage were positive predictors of ground water nitrate concentrations. Percentage of blueberry was a marginally significant negative predictor in the watershed and freeform polygon models, and percentage of residential coverage was a positive predictor in the freeform polygon and buffer zone models. Spatial autocorrelation was present in the freeform polygon and buffer zone models even after land use was taken into account. In conclusion, analyses based on watersheds produced the best predictive model with the percentages of land cover of potato, hay, and grain being significantly associated with ground water nitrate concentrations, and the percentages of blueberry, clear-cut woodland, and other agriculture being marginally significant.

AB  - Sono stati esaminati i vari aspetti agronomici ed ecologici legati alla biodiversità floristica dell'agroecosistema. La tutela della diversità floristica dell'agroecosistema assume un ruolo agronomico, in quanto rende gli interventi di difesa più flessibili e meno dipendenti dal mezzo chimico. Lo scopo del presente lavoro è stato quello di passare in rassegna sia i motivi dell'erosione genetica di alcune specie, sia i metodi agronomici in grado preservare quella diversità floristica che è ormai considerata un vero e proprio indicatore biologico della salute di un agroecosistema. La rivalutazione delle caratteristiche allelopatiche di vecchie cultivar, la tutela di vegetazioni spontanee adiacenti alle colture (field margin), nonché l'uso di mezzi di difesa eco-compatibili rappresentano strategie di tutela della biodiversità floristica. E' stato infine evidenziato il ruolo paesaggistico di agroecosistemi caratterizzati da elevata biodiversità

AB  - The present study was performed to characterise in-stream pesticide exposure within the Palatinate vineyard region in south-west Germany, evaluate the influence of buffer strip widths and identify mitigation measures for the relevant entry pathways. In-stream water and sediment samples that were taken at nine sampling sites of different buffer widths following intense rainfall, and edge-of-field runoff that were sampled in erosion rills were analysed regarding 28 active ingredients of pesticides including copper. In-stream samples contained a mix of 8±4 pesticide compounds, resulting in total pesticide concentrations of 1.4–8.9μgl⁻¹ for water and 16–670μgkg⁻¹dw for sediment. Following an exceptional rainfall event with a previous 34-day drought period, pesticide concentrations reached 7.0–83.4μgl⁻¹. Fungicides were the most important pesticides found and were significantly correlated with the pesticide application frequency and rate. The calculated toxicity values per sample (TUₘₐₓ) indicated that both organic pesticides and copper concentrations likely cause ecotoxicological effects in the field. The buffer strip width was of little importance for pesticide in-stream concentrations because pesticide entry occurred mainly via the field path network and erosion rills. Pesticide in-stream concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations detected in erosion rills (R²=0.56). As possible risk mitigation measures, we suggest the implementation of grassed field paths and vegetated ditches or wetlands.

AB  - Pnigalio soemius is a polyphagous ectoparasitoid of late instars of leafminers or gallmaking larvae belonging to different orders of holometabolous insects. The aim of this work was to determine whether two populations of P. soemius obtained respectively from two lepidopteran hosts (Cosmopterix pulchrimella and Holocacista rivillei) represent a single species or two sibling species. Different complementary approaches were used: (1) uni- and multivariate analysis of morphological characters; (2) reproductive compatibility tests; (3) evaluation and comparison of different behavioral and biological traits; (4) karyological analysis (chromosome number, morphology and NORs); (5) molecular characterization of mtDNA (COI) and RFLP-PCR. Our results demonstrate the existence of two reproductively isolated cryptic species, even though their two karyotypes could not be distinguished and the morphometric analysis was only partially able to discriminate the two populations (86% with analysis of ratios and 92% with analysis of Burnaby size-adjusted data). These results point out that the broad concept of P. soemius may include cryptic species whose correct characterization plays a decisive role when evaluating the effects of field-margin habitats.

AB  - This limited analysis resulted from a request by the Nebraska National Forest to provide some economic estimates to the value of changes in forage availability that would result from three proposed levels of rodenticide use in the management of black-tailed prairie dogs (BTPD) on the Nebraska National Forest (NNF) and associated units managed by NNF (i.e. Buffalo Gap National Grasslands, Ft. Pierre National Grasslands in South Dakota, and the Oglala National Grasslands in Nebraska.)  
The values of changes in forage availability were determined based on three alternatives of rodenticide use.  These alternatives include: (1) limit use of rodenticides to only protect public health & safety and maintain facilities; (2) maintain a 1 mile buffer zone to prevent encroachment of BTPDs onto adjacent private or tribal agricultural land; and (3) provide a 1 mile buffer zone in the Conata Basin area (under specific conditions), ¼ mile buffer on the Ft. Pierre National Grasslands, and ½ mile buffer everywhere else.  Two levels of estimates were provided by the NNF estimating the change in available forage from BTPD expansion given: (1) normal to above normal precipitation, and (2) below normal precipitation; over a 10 year period.  Forage change estimates where provided by the NNF in pounds and in terms of Animal Unit Months (AUMs) of grazing.  A 3 year average of hay prices ($70.00/ton) and AUM rates ($16.63/AUM) from the SD Agricultural Statistic Service were used to value the change in forage availability.  
The results of this analysis showed that under Alternative 1, the value of the change in forage availability in pounds range from loss of $79,870 to $212,065 from the low to high projected expansion of BTPD colonies.  In terms of AUM value this loss ranged from $48,686 to $129,208.  Under Alternative 2, the value of the change in forage availability in pounds range from a gain of $59,185 to $62,860 from the low to high projected decrease in BTPD colonies.  In terms of AUM value this gain ranged from $36,029 to $38,274.  With respect to Alternative 3, there was an overall gain in value from the reduction of BTPD colonies.  In terms of pounds of available forage this value ranged from $9,065 to $23,835 and in AUM value from $5,506 to $14,521.  Only the Ft. Pierre National Grassland had a loss of value under the low BTPD expansion estimate of $2,065 in the value per ton and $1,264 in the AUM value under Alternative 3.

AB  - This study compared three spatio-temporal models for estimation of exposure to air pollution throughout the central part of Scotland during 1970–79 for approximately 21,600 individuals in 2 closely-related prospective cohort studies. Although 181 black smoke (BS) monitoring sites operated in this region at some point during 1970–79, a substantial amount of BS exposure data was missing at many sites. The three exposure estimation methods were: (i) area-based regression models to impute missing data followed by assignment of exposure by inverse distance weighting of observed BS at nearby monitoring sites (IDWBS); (ii) area-based regression models to impute missing data followed by a spatial regression additive model using four local air quality predictors (LAQP): altitude; distance to the nearest major road; household density within a 250 m buffer zone; and distance to the edge of urban boundary (AMBS); (iii) a multilevel spatio-temporal model using LAQP (MultiBS). The three methods were evaluated using maps of predicted BS, and cross validation using monitored and imputed BS at sites with ≥80% data. The use of LAQP in the AMBS and MultiBS exposure models provided spatial patterns in BS consistent with known sources of BS associated with major roads and the centre of urban areas. Cross-validation analyses demonstrated that the MultiBS model provided more precise predictions (R² = 60%) of decadal geometric mean BS concentrations at monitoring sites compared with the IDWBS and AMBS models (R² of 19% and 20%, respectively).

AB  - The production-oriented agricultural system of Midwestern United States has caused environmental problems such as soil degradation and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of water. Riparian buffers have been shown to reduce the impacts of NPS pollutants on stream water quality through the enhancement of riparian zone soil quality. The objective of this study was to compare soil-water infiltration in a Coland soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Endoaquoll) under multi-species riparian buffer vegetation with that of cultivated fields and a grazed pasture. Eight infiltration measurements were made, in each of six treatments. Bulk density, antecedent soil moisture, and particle size were also examined. The average 60-min cumulative infiltration was five times greater under the buffers than under the cultivated field and pasture. Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass. Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends. Thus, when using infiltration as an index, the established multi-species buffer vegetation seemed to improve soil quality after six years.

AB  - Although geotextile mats have considerable potential for soil conservation, field studies on their impacts on soil particle size distribution and nutrient conservation are scant. Hence, field experiments were conducted at Hilton, east Shropshire, U.K. (52°33′5.7″N, 2°19′18.3″W) during 2007–2009, to study the impacts of palm-mat geotextiles on topsoil (0–5cm) particle size distribution and changes in selected nutrients (total P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Cl). Geotextile-mats constructed from Borassus aethiopum (Borassus palm of West Africa) and Mauritia flexuosa (Buriti palm of South America) leaves are termed Borassus mats and Buriti mats, respectively. Ten runoff plots (10×1m on a 15° slope) were established, with duplicate treatments. The treatments were: (i) bare soil; (ii) permanent grass; (iii) bare soil with 1m Borassus-mat buffer zones (area coverage ~10%) at the lower end of the plots; (iv) bare soil with 1m Buriti-mat buffer zones (area coverage ~10%) at the lower end of the plots; and (v) completely-covered with Borassus mats. Initial and final topsoil samples were collected and analysed for sand (fine, medium and coarse), silt (fine, medium and coarse), clay and selected nutrients. Results revealed that soil silt and clay contents significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the Borassus completely-covered plots with a concomitant increase in proportion of sand content after ~2years. Both Borassus and Buriti buffer strip plots also had lower soil clay contents, indicating that palm-mat geotextile cover significantly affected particle size distribution, even after only 2years. Buriti mat-cover within the buffer strip plots resulted in notably higher decrease in mean (n=2) clay content, with a concomitant increase in mean (n=2) sand contents compared with mean (n=18) clay and sand contents of bare soils within the same plots. Data indicate that total P and total K contents with Borassus completely-covered plots significantly (P<0.01) increased and total Ca content decreased after ~2years. However, except grassed plots, all plots had significant (P<0.05) increases in total P concentrations. Borassus buffer strip plots also had significant (P<0.05) decreases in total Ca contents over the initial contents. The increases in total P and K contents within Borassus complete-cover plots were significantly (P<0.05) higher than both grassed and Buriti buffer strip plots. Borassus buffer strip plots significantly (P<0.05) decreased total Ca content compared to bare and grassed plots. Treatments had no significant (P>0.05) effects on changes in other selected nutrients (total Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Cl) concentrations. In summary, it is evident that despite significant (P<0.05) decreases in soil clay and total Ca contents, use of Borassus mats as buffer strips was very successful in conserving or improving other selected soil properties.

AB  - Despite geotextile-mats having the potential for soil conservation, field studies on the effects of geotextiles on soil properties are limited. Hence, the utilization of palm-mat geotextiles as a potential soil conservation technique was investigated at Hilton, east Shropshire, U.K. (52°33′5.7″ N, 2°19′18.3″ W). Geotextile-mats constructed from Borassus aethiopum (Borassus palm of West Africa) and Mauritia flexuosa (Buriti palm of South America) leaves are termed Borassus mats and Buriti mats, respectively. Field experiments were conducted at Hilton during 2007–2009, to study the impacts of Borassus and Buriti mats on selected properties of the topsoil (0–5cm). Ten fixed plots (10×1m on a 15° slope) were established, with duplicate treatments. The treatments were: (i) bare soil; (ii) permanent grassed; (iii) bare soil with 1m Borassus-mat buffer strips (area coverage ~10%) at the lower end of the plots; (iv) bare soil with 1m Buriti mat buffer strips (area coverage ~10%) at the lower end of the plots; and (v) completely-covered with Borassus mats. Initial and final soil samples of the topsoil were collected and analysed for bulk density, aggregate stability, soil organic matter (SOM), total soil C (TSC), total soil N (TSN) and pH. Results indicate that, apart from Borassus completely-covered plots, soil bulk density increased and aggregate stability decreased in all plots after two years. Despite decreases in SOM contents in bare plots, SOM content did not change after two years in the grassed and geotextile treated plots. Treatments had no effects on changes in pH, TSC or TSN. Both Borassus and Buriti mat-covers within the buffer strip plots had little impact on SOM, TSC and TSN changes compared with bare soils within the same plots. Thus, Borassus buffer strip plots were very effective in maintaining some soil properties (i.e. SOM, TSC, and TSN) after two years of erosion by water. In summary, utilization of Borassus mats as buffer strips was very successful in conserving soil properties on a loamy sand soil.

AB  - Despite palm-leaf geotextile mats having the potential to advance soil conservation technologies, field studies using geotextiles as complete cover and buffer strips in reducing rates of soil erosion by water are limited. Hence, the utilization of these mats as a potential soil conservation technique is investigated at Hilton, east Shropshire, UK (52°33'5.7"N, 2°19'18.3"W). Geotextile mats constructed from Borassus aethiopum (Borassus palm of West Africa) and Mauritia flexuosa (Buriti palm of South America) leaves are termed Borassus mats and Buriti mats, respectively. Field experiments have been conducted at Hilton since January 2007, to study the effects of emplacing Borassus and Buriti mats on the erosion of a loamy sand soil. Two sets (12 plots each) of experiments were established to study the effects of Borassus and Buriti mats on splash height and splash erosion. In both sets, 6 randomly-selected plots were completely covered with mats, and the rest were bare. Ten runoff plots (10x1m on a 15° slope) were also established, with duplicate treatments to study the effectiveness of these mats for soil and water conservation. The treatments were: (i) bare soil; (ii) permanent grassed; (iii) bare soil with 1m Borassus mat buffer zones at the lower end of the plots; (iv) bare soil with 1m Buriti mat buffer zones at the lower end of the plots and (v) completely covered with Borassus mats. Results (during 22/01/07-21/01/08; total precipitation=919.0mm; n =22 sets of measurements) indicate that Borassus mat-cover on bare soil significantly (P <0.05) reduced total soil splash erosion by ~90% compared with bare plots (24.81kgm⁻²). Plots with Borassus mats had 51% less mean splash height than bare plots (n =21 sets of measurements). However, Buriti mat-cover on bare soils had no significant (P <0.05) effect on soil splash height or splash erosion. Results of runoff plots (08/01/07-14/01/08; total precipitation=923.4mm; n =29 sets of measurements) showed permanent grass plots had the smallest runoff coefficient and the largest sediment yield reduction effectiveness (SYRE). Total runoff from the Borassus buffer zone plots (4.1Lm⁻²) was ~83% less than the bare plots and total sediment yield was ~93% less than the bare plots (2.32kgm⁻²). Although, Borassus buffer zone plots had similar effects in reducing soil loss to Borassus completely-covered plots, the later treatment yielded ~50% more runoff. Borassus buffer strip plots had less SYRE than the Buriti buffer zone plots. Mass per unit area and thickness of both geotextiles decreased after 3 months of surface application. However, moisture sorption depth and cover percentage of both geotextiles increased. Hence, it is recommended to cover palm-mat geotextiles as buffer strips for soil and water conservation on erodible moderate slopes.

AB  - Chitwan National Park is surrounded by large settlements of people who exploit the areas where tigers and their prey occur. In this study, we measured the associations between the abundance of the prey of tiger with habitat, topographic, predator and human disturbance variables, using canonical correspondence analysis. We show that the abundance of hog deer is closely associated with areas of tall grassland and floodplains, while that of other ungulate species is associated with that of forests and short grasslands. Primates were mainly abundant in riverine and mixed forests. Abundances of most species, except hog deer and wild pig, were more closely associated with areas of forests than with open areas, because the latter were mainly occupied by humans and livestock. The presence of the species studied was closely associated with habitat and disturbance variables. Proximity of water holes was more closely associated with the presence of ungulates than primates. There were close associations between human disturbance and abundances of primates and muntjac, possibly because these species are more tolerant and adapted to human disturbance. However, the major prey species of tiger were negatively associated with human disturbance. As a consequence, human disturbance has resulted in a decline in the abundance of tigers and the lack of prey could result in their extinction in the Chitwan NP. Therefore, in terms of the conservation and management of the park, minimizing human disturbance of wildlife habitats and restoration of a buffer zone forest should be the prime objectives.

AB  - The transport of nutrients and soil sediments in runoff has been recognized as a noteworthy environmental issue. Vegetative Filter Strips (VFS) have been used as one of the best management practices (BMPs) for retaining nutrients and sediments from surface runoff, thus preventing the pollutants from reaching receiving waters. However, the effectiveness of a VFS when combined with a subsurface drainage system has not been investigated previously. This study was undertaken to monitor the retention and transport of nutrients within a VFS that had a subsurface drainage system installed at a depth of 1.2 m below the soil surface. Nutrient concentrations of NO3-N (Nitrate Nitrogen), PO4- (Orthophosphorus), and TP (Total Phosphorus) were measured in surface water samples (entering and leaving the VFS), and subsurface outflow. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for plant available Phosphorus (Bray P1) and NO3-N concentrations. Results showed that PO4-, NO3-N, and TP concentrations decreased in surface flow through the VFS. Many surface outflow water samples from the VFS showed concentration reductions of as much as 75% for PO4- and 70% for TP. For subsurface outflow water samples through the drainage system, concentrations of PO4- and TP decreased but NO3-N concentrations increased in comparison to concentrations in surface inflow samples. Soil samples that were collected from various depths in the VFS showed a minimal buildup of nutrients in the top soil profile but indicated a gradual buildup of nutrients at the depth of the subsurface drain. Results demonstrate that although a VFS can be very effective in reducing runoff and nutrients from surface flow, the presence of a subsurface drain underneath the VFS may not be environmentally beneficial. Such a combination may increase NO3-N transport from the VFS, thus invalidating the purpose of the BMP.

AB  - In the small, agricultural, artificially drained Orgeval watershed δ15N values of leached nitrates and soil organic nitrogen were found to be significantly higher than the primary nitrogen (N) sources from which they are derived, namely, synthetic fertilizers, atmospheric deposition, and symbiotic or nonsymbiotic N2 fixation (all with δ15N close to zero). In vertical soil profiles, the δ15N of organic N increased with depth, reaching higher values (up to 8‰) particularly at stations that were frequently waterlogged as judged from ochre iron traces, such as downhill field sites or in riparian buffer strips. Nitrification, volatilization, and denitrification are the main fractionating processes able to modify the isotopic composition of soil N. Using a newly designed algorithm for calculating the equilibrium isotopic composition of all soil N species, resulting from the average annual balance of their transformations, we show that the observed trends can be explained by the action of denitrification. We suggest that the isotopic composition of soil organic N can be used as a semiquantitative indicator of the intensity of denitrification integrated over century-long periods.

AB  - Traditionally managed arable fields host a specialised flora adapted to regular disturbance through tillage. Agricultural intensification during the 20th century resulted in a pronounced biodiversity decline in European agroecosystems. Anthoceros agrestis and Phaeoceros carolinianus, both largely confined to cultivated land in Central Europe and the only representatives of hornworts in northern Switzerland, are examples of species that decreased in Central Europe during the last century. A repeated survey of 28 arable fields in the Swiss Plateau from 1989 to 1995 demonstrated that crop type and associated farming routines were critical in determining hornwort occurrences. During the 10 years following the completion of this survey, agri-environment schemes were introduced aiming at a more environmental-friendly agricultural production. We re-investigated the selected sites in 2005-2007 to examine whether these programmes favoured hornworts. We found a significant decrease of untilled autumn stubble-fields, which accounted for a decline of hornworts. High relative summer air humidity positively affected hornwort occurrence. Gametophytic populations of both taxa regenerated from the persistent diaspore bank after years of unfavourable conditions. To ensure the long-term persistence of hornworts in the Swiss Plateau, we recommend three alternative modifications of current Swiss agri-environment schemes to be implemented in cereal fields with known hornwort occurrences: (1) Tailored conservation headlands, (2) Autumn stubble-fields and (3) Field margin strips sown with arable flora but without crop plants. The proposed practices will promote other typically ephemeral arable bryophytes and seed plants and are likely to be advantageous also for other organisms, such as farmland birds.

AB  - Riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest have traditionally beena source of natural resources, such as timber and grazing, and havebeen used as transportation corridors and homestead sites. A primaryimpact of use has been the removal of riparian trees, thecrowns and roots of which provide shade and stream bank protection.Increases in water temperature can be lethal to salmonid fish,and decreasing salmon populations over the past few decades haveresulted in an urgent need for improving the management of watersheds,fish habitat, and water quality. Leaving stream-side buffersis now required by state forest practices regulations on forestlands, but no regulations are in place on agricultural lands, whereriparian trees have frequently been removed.In 1995, the Beaver Creek Riparian Buffer Project was establishedto develop better information about how to establish riparianbuffers on coastal pastureland near Newport, Oregon. No ripariantrees were present when the trial was begun. A replicatedtree filter belt trial was established along the south bank of the creekto compare unplanted pasture (controls) with commercially valuedred alder (Alnus rubra) planted at 6-ft spacing in belts 1 row, 3rows, and 6 rows wide. Tree survival and height and diametergrowth were compared, as well as the amount of shade producedby the three treatments and control. We used a LI-COR LAI-2000Plant Canopy Analyzer to quantify shade. We found that intensivesite preparation, continued vegetation management, and both fencingand tubing of tree seedlings were necessary to gain survival and protect seedlings from small rodents, beaver, and cattle. Fencingout cattle provided stream bank protection within 1 yr. Significantshading of the stream occurred 2–6 yr after planting, as trees grewtall enough to intercept a significant amount of light. Single rowplantings that take a minimal amount of pasture offer significantshading only after 4–7 yr. A wider 6-row filter belt occupies a greateramount of pasture, but provides stream shading sooner than theother treatments.

AB  - Agricultural intensification, including changes in cutting, grazing and fertilizer regimes, has led to declines in UK and NW European grassland biodiversity. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that would support invertebrate diversity and abundance on intensively managed grassland farms, focusing on planthoppers and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha). Replicated across four farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to create seven treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity and increasing sward architectural complexity. Auchenorrhyncha were sampled annually between 2003 and 2005. Auchenorrhyncha abundance and species richness was highest in the most extensively managed treatments. Abundance was lowest with frequent cutting, while species richness was lowest where cattle grazing occurred. Unexpectedly, application of inorganic fertilizer had no effect on Auchenorrhyncha abundance or species richness. Management options that enhance invertebrate diversity, while allowing the remainder of the field to be managed conventionally, represent a potentially important conservation tool for many lowland improved grasslands. Extensification of conventional management in field margin areas of such grasslands are likely to benefit this numerically dominant component of grassland invertebrate fauna. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing UK and European agri-environment schemes.

AB  - Research on best management practices, including vegetative filter strips, is needed to evaluate the potential for reducing herbicides in surface runoff. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the influence of different filter strip components on fluometuron adsorption. Samples were taken from a switchgrass filter strip (1-m wide) established on a Brooksville silty clay. Sampled components included switchgrass stems clipped to 4 cm, plant residue on the soil surface, and topsoil < 5-mm, 0.5- to 1-cm, 1- to 3-cm, and 3- to 5-cm deep. The filter strip topsoil samples contained 1.8, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.8% organic matter for the aforementioned depths, respectively, compared with 1.8% in soil collected from an adjacent cropped area. Fluometuron adsorption on each sample was compared at initial concentrations of 0.017, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg L−1, the last of these representing four times the peak concentration in surface runoff. Fluometuron adsorption was greater in soil from filter strip areas than in soil from cropped areas. Averaged over concentration, the soil–water partition coefficient (Kd) value for soil 1- to 3-cm and 3- to 5-cm deep was greater than the value for soil from the cropped area. Stems and residue had Kd values 4.9- and 4.1-fold greater, respectively, than soil from the cropped area. Average adsorption coefficients normalized for organic carbon content (Koc) of soil < 5-mm and 3- to 5-cm deep from filter strip areas were greater than the values for soil from cropped areas.

AB  - Addition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) barriers to vegetative filter strips (FS) shows potential as conservation practice. This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three conservation practices in reducing runoff, sediment, N, and P losses from 1.5- by 16-m plots on an Aeric Epiaqualf. Three practices compared are a traditional fescue (Festuca arundinacea) filter strip (Fescue-FS), a switchgrass barrier in combination with the Fescue-FS (B-Fescue-FS) and a switchgrass barrier in combination with a native grass and forbs species filter strip (B-Native-FS). This study also predicts transport of sediment, N, and P in Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS. Fescue-FS and B-Fescue-FS of equal widths (0.7 m) significantly reduced runoff and sediment transport as compared with a continuous cultivated fallow (CCF) treatment, but B-Fescue-FS was more effective for reducing runoff (p < 0.05) and sediment (p < 0.01) transport. B-Fescue-FS was also more effective than Fescue-FS for reducing losses of organic N, NO3-N, NH4-N, particulate P, and PO4-P (p < 0.01). Fescue-FS and B-Native-FS were equally effective for reducing runoff, sediment, and nutrient loss. Effectiveness of FS increased with distance with 18% of runoff, 92% of sediment, and 71% of nutrient leaving the source area being reduced in the first 4 m of the FS. An equation to predict sediment associated with runoff ponding above barriers explained approximately 70% of the variability between measured and predicted values of sediment, organic N, and particulate P transport. Combination of switchgrass barriers with FS is an effective alternative to Fescue-FS alone for reducing sediment and nutrients in runoff.

AB  - Field margin weeds may contribute to the invasion and persistence of weeds in arable fields. Experimental studies of this hypothesis, however, have been inconclusive. We examined the role of field margin weed populations with a spatially explicit simulation model of Canada thistle population dynamics. We measured the contribution of field margin populations to weed pressure in the field across a wide range of parameter values and compared the weed control value of efforts applied to the field margin to that of similar efforts applied to the field. Under most combinations of parameter values, field margin weeds contributed little to weed pressure in the field, suggesting that controlling field margin weeds may often be of little value. Two conditions appeared to be necessary for field margin weeds to influence weed population dynamics within the field: the presence of unoccupied weed habitat, which increased the importance of dispersal to population growth, and high dispersal rates of field margin weeds relative to field weeds, which increased the relative contribution of field margin weeds to dispersal.Nomenclature: Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.)

AB  - Tsunami intervention has been an extraordinary and unprecedented relief and recovery operation. This article underlines the complexities posed by shelter and housing intervention in post-tsunami Sri Lanka, revealing a pragmatic, reductionist approach to shelter and housing reconstruction in a contested and fragmented environment. Competition, housing anxiety and buffer zone implementation have resulted in compulsory villagisation inland, stirring feelings of discrimination and tension, and becoming major obstacles to equitable rebuilding of houses and livelihoods. A new tsunami geography has been imposed on an already vulnerable conflict-based geography, in which shelter has been conceived as a mono-dimensional artefact. An analysis of the process and outcomes of temporary and permanent post-tsunami housing programmes yields information about the extent to which shelter policies and programmes serve not only physical needs but 'higher order' objectives for a comprehensive and sustainable recovery plan.

AB  - Forest-ecosystem disturbance caused by non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting by local people is a controversial issue. Conflicts between local people and the government due to NTFP collection, occur in several protected forests in Thailand. The main purpose of this study was to explore people's collection and use of NTFPs at 2 sites; site 1; consisted of 4 villages in the buffer zone of a protected forest, and site 2 was a village adjacent to a reserved forest. Additionally, institutional arrangements were also investigated. The results indicate that some NTFPs. i.e. various types of mushroom, bamboo shoots and Phak Wan (Melientha suavis Pierre) are popular and heavily collected by local people. Thus the degree of forest ecosystem disturbance may be beyond the natural carrying capacity, particularly for highly priced products. To minimise the negative effects ecosystem disturbance due to NTFP collection, co-operation from local people is imperative. Management techniques that utilise the insights gained from community-relation programs such as those at Site 2, are also needed. Above all, officials should have a positive attitude towards the villagers' livelihood. Flexibility in dealing with local people is also considered important.

AB  - In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology had been applied for monitoring the change of forest land use and determining risk area for encroachment of Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary and buffer zone at distance of radius 2 km. Extracted information showed that the change of land use may impact to the wildlife and their habitats. These information can be used to setting up the guideline for the natural resources planning in the study site. The study area was classified into 6 major land use categories. They were forest area, agricultural land, built-up area, grassland, water bodies and others area (old clearing and shifting cultivation). The results of land use change in 22 years (1973-1995) shown that the forest area were decreased from 3,188.012 square km in 1973 to 3,063.591 square km in 1995. Forest area had been changed to others area, agricultural land, water bodies, built-up area and grassland. The other land use categories included agricultural land, built-up area, grassland, water bodies and others area were increased in area of 16.258, 0.795, 0.226, 5.047 and 102.096 square km, respectively. The classification of risk area for encroachment by using important factors which included elevation, slope, geology, soil, location of village and road. It was classified into 3 categories: high, moderately and low categories. The area and percentage of risk area for Encroachment are 24.750 square km, 289.375 square km and 2,751.063 square km or 0.822 percent, 9.504 percent ant 89.674 percent of study area, respectively.

AB  - The relationships between fish community δ15N and δ13C values and land use in watersheds and in buffer zones of nine French lakes were studied. The results showed inter-lakes variability of mean δ15N and δ13C values for different fish species. The study of correlations between fish δ15N and δ13C values and the proportions from different land use categories in watersheds showed a land use effect on fish δ15N values but not on δ13C values. The results underlined the great impact of manure spreading on grasslands as a nitrate source in our lakes. Nevertheless, the best correlations between fish δ15N values and land use were obtained when the entire fish community (i.e. the whole fish community mean δ15N values in each lake) and all anthropogenic activities (residential lands, camp sites and grasslands for our systems) were considered in either watersheds or in buffer zones. Thus, for our sites, the fish δ15N values are useful to evaluate nitrogen inputs from human and animal wastes at the watershed-scale as well as at the buffer zone-scale. The absence of land use effect on the fish community δ13C values could be at least partly explained by the small size of these lakes in which it has been shown that consumers, namely macroinvertebrates, have δ13C values largely influenced by organic matter recycling activity.

AB  - Les relations entre les valeurs de δ15N et δ13C des communautés pisciaires, l’occupation des bassins versants et des zones tampon de neuf lacs français ont été étudiées. Les résultats montrent une variablilité inter-lac des valeurs moyennes de δ15N et δ13C pour les différentes espèces. L’étude des relations entre les valeurs isotopiques des poissons et les proportions des différentes catégories d’usage des bassins versants montre une corrélation entre l’occupation des sols et les valeurs de δ15N des poissons alors qu’aucune corrélation n’apparaît si l’on considère les valeurs de δ13C. Les résultats obtenus mettent en évidence l’impact important de l’utilisation des lisiers sur prairies comme source de nitrate dans ces lacs. Les meilleures corrélations entre les valeurs de δ15N des poissons et l’occupation de l’espace sont obtenues quand la communauté de poissons dans son ensemble (c'est-à-dire les valeurs moyennes de δ15N pour toutes les espèces dans chaque lac) et toutes les activités anthropiques (zones d’habitation, camping et prairies) sont prises en compte aussi bien au niveau du bassin versant que de la zone tampon. Pour les lacs étudiés, les valeurs de δ15N des poissons permettent d’évaluer l’impact des apports d’azote dus aux déchets humains et animaux, aussi bien au niveau du bassin versant que de la zone tampon. L’absence de corrélation entre l’occupation des sols et les signatures en carbone des poissons peut être expliquée, au moins partiellement, par la petite taille de ces lacs dans lesquels il a été montré que les consommateurs, dont les macroinvertébrés, ont des valeurs de δ13C largement influencées par le recyclage interne de la matière organique.

AB  - Buffer strips are an efficient and economical way to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Local researches are necessary to gain information on buffer performance, with particular emphasis on narrow buffers. The effect of a 6 m buffer strip (BS) in reducing runoff, suspended solids and nutrients from a field growing maize, winter wheat and soybean was assessed in a field experiment conducted in North-East Italy during 1998-2001. The BS was composed of two rows of regularly alternating trees (Platanus hybrida Brot.) and shrubs (Viburnum opulus L.), with grass (Festuca arundinacea L.) in the inter-rows. The BS reduced total runoff by 78% compared to no-BS, in which cumulative runoff depth was 231 mm over 4 years. With no-BS runoff appeared to be influenced mostly by total rainfall, while with BS maximum rainfall intensity was more important. The filtering effect of the BS reduced total suspended solids (TSS), particularly after the second year, when the median yearly concentrations ranged from 0.28 to 0.99 mg L(-1) and were smaller than 0.14 mg L(-1), with no-BS and with BS respectively. The combination of lower concentrations and runoff volumes significantly reduced TSS losses from 6.9 to 0.4 t ha(-1) over the entire period. A tendency to increased concentrations of all forms of N (total, nitrate and ammonium) while passing through the BS was observed, but total N losses were reduced from 17.3 to 4.5 kg ha(-1) in terms of mass balance. On the contrary, P concentrations were unmodified (soluble P), or lowered (total P) by the BS, reducing total losses by about 80%. The effect on total P, composed mainly of sediment-bound forms, was related to particulate settling when passing through the BS. A numerical index (Eutrophic Load Index), integrating water quality and runoff volumes, was created to evaluate the eutrophication risk of runoff with or without the BS. It showed that the BS effect was mostly due to a reduction of runoff volumes rather than improving the overall water quality.

AB  - Results of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemiological and serological investigations in 21 Subjects of the Russian Federation in a zone of high risk of FMD carrying and spreading were summarized. The preventive vaccination of animals against the disease was carried out in those zones. Sera samples (12,214) from cattle and small ruminants were tested using ELISA for the presence of antibodies to A, O, Asia-1 FMD virus. Levels of animal immune profiles in different settlements, establishments, farms and regions of the RF were different. As is shown, almost in each region of the anti-FMD high risk zone at different times after vaccination there were objects in which, irrespective of the vaccine used high level of immune animals (80-100%) sufficient to prevent FMD epizootics was found and there were objects having a low index of immune animals and no immune animals. As was observed, in most regions the percentage of immune animals to the Asia-1 FMD virus was higher than to the A, O FMD virus. In adult cattle in the period from 10 days till 6 months after vaccination the strength of immune response reached 80% and higher and was absent in the first days after it and at long date when blood samples were taken from cattle youngsters later than 3 months and in adult animals 6 months after vaccination. Results of 3,852 blood sera samples testing for the presence of antibodies to FMD virus non-structural proteins testified that animals in the buffer zone of the RF were not infected

AB  - Methods for simulating different landscape positions within the SWAT model are being examined. A three component system, consisting of the watershed divide, the hillslope, and the floodplain landscape positions, has been developed to address flow and transport across hydrologic response units prior to concentration in streams. The modified SWAT model is capable of simulating flow and transport from higher landscape positions to lower positions within a single river basin. The revision was developed to address variable source areas within watersheds and stream-side buffer systems which exist alongside many streams. The enhanced model will allow for more accurate simulation of natural transport processes within a hillslope. The revision was tested using data collected from a low-gradient watershed near Tifton, Georgia, USA which contains heavily vegetated riparian buffers. The modified model provided reasonable simulations of surface and subsurface flow across the landscape positions without calibration. The application demonstrates the applicability of the model to simulate filtering of surface runoff, enhanced infiltration, and water quality buffering typically associated with riparian buffer systems.

AB  - Accurate simulation of landscape processes in natural resource models requires spatial distribution of basin hydrology and transport processes. To better represent these processes, a landscape version of the SWAT model has been developed to simulate the runoff, run-on, and infiltration processes that typically occur in different parts of the landscape. The model addresses flow and transport across hydrologic response units prior to concentration in streams, and is capable of simulating flow and transport from higher landscape positions to lower positions. The SWAT landscape model was tested using data collected from a heavily vegetated riparian buffer system in the Atlantic Coastal Plain near Tifton, Georgia. Simulations of surface runoff, lateral subsurface runoff, and groundwater flow for an upland field, a grass buffer, and a sub-divided forested buffer floodplain were generated. Model results and field data indicate that surface runoff was dominant in the upland field, while groundwater flow was dominant in the grass buffer and the floodplain. While average annual surface runoff agreed satisfactorily with observations from the site, annual and monthly simulated values varied considerably from observed values. Simulated surface runoff tracked general trends in the observed data, but winter months and extreme events were overestimated while summer months were underestimated. Annual surface runoff predictions at the edge of the upland field varied from the observed data by 11% to 44%. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for annual estimates of surface runoff at the field edge was 0.83 for the three-year calibration period. The results demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the surface runoff and enhanced infiltration typically associated with riparian buffer systems. Additional revision of the model will likely be necessary to adequately represent redistribution of water between surface, lateral subsurface flow, and groundwater flow.

AB  - Matric potential was measured in a grass and forest riparian buffer system adjacent to a cropped field in the Georgia Coastal Plain. The soil in the adjacent cropped field is a Tifton loamy sand, containing an argillic subsurface horizon with plinthite at approximately 1 m which has been shown to restrict vertical infiltration and induce lateral flow. Two years of matric potential data and measurements of soil hydraulic characteristics were examined to evaluate and quantify unsaturated water flow in the riparian buffer. The lowest soil matric potential occurred at the grass/forest interface, and the greatest surface infiltration occurred within 10 m downslope of the same interface. The area of low matric potential was likely due to water uptake by trees. Water flowed laterally through the unsaturated soil into the riparian area from the upland field, apparently induced by low vertical conductivity in the subsurface and driven by the high water demand of the forest

AB  - Water table gradients were measured and saturated flow rates estimated for a hillslope consisting of a tilled upland field and a downslope riparian forest buffer system located in the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain Tifton-Vidalia Uplands. Three years of water table measurements and estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity were used to evaluate and quantify saturated waterflow gradients, directions, and rates. Forest treatments consisting of clear cutting, thinning, and no cutting were examined. The gradient of the water table from the top of the landscape to the bottom varied from 0.9 to 0.2%, less than the 1.5% land slope. The direction of groundwater flow generally followed the land slope. However, during summer months the hydraulic gradient within the forested buffer reversed direction. Water table data indicate the riparian area was saturated from January through March. During this time, flow direction the shallow aquifer is from the top of the field to the stream bottom. During summer months, high rates of forest evapotranspiration created large water sinks in the shallow subsurface and large local hydraulic gradients. Examination of water table elevations indicates the seasonal water demand of the forest shifts the direction of shallow subsurface aquifer flow. During these periods flow direction within the riparian buffer was from the lowest landscape position to the riparian forest, reversed from winter months. Total subsurface flow within the hillslope was calculated as 35 mm yr-1, 3% of average annual precipitation. Average groundwater linear velocity was calculated as 1.4 mm h-1. Evapotranspiration loss was estimated as 67% of average annual precipitation

AB  - Forested riparian buffer strips are recommended as an agricultural best management practice for protection of water quality and for wildlife habitat. Since the 1990s, federal and state conservation agencies in Virginia have been involved in establishment of riparian buffers under the auspices of programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality. However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow. Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.

AB  - Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO₃ ⁻ and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips; there was no difference in N₂O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions; when amended with H₂O or with H₂O+NO₃ ⁻, potential denitrification was higher (P <0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H₂O+glucose, or with H₂O+NO₃ ⁻ +glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter-soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter-soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2-4 times higher in earthworm-litter-soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N₂O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N₂O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N₂O emissions.

AB  - Poultry-litter applications to pastures can result in relatively high soil phosphorus (P) levels, which in turn can contaminate runoff and degrade surface water quality. New management protocols for temperate grasslands are needed to reduce the risk of P transport to surface water. The effects of three land-use treatments on soil characteristics related to P runoff were investigated using small watersheds with 8% slope near Booneville, Arkansas, U.S. The land use treatments were (1) haying of bermudagrass overseeded with winter annual forage (ryegrass or rye), (2) rotationally grazed, and (3) rotationally grazed with 12-m-wide tree buffer on the downhill portion of the plot. Plots and trees were established in 2003. Annual spring application of poultry litter (5.6 Mg ha⁻¹) to the hayed or grazed portions of the plots was started in 2004. Grazing treatments were imposed shortly thereafter. By the summer of 2008 (4 years of treatments), soil concentrations of Bray 1–extractable P and soluble reactive P had increased significantly from approximately 40 and 4 mg P kg⁻¹ soil, respectively, to more than 200 and 30 mg P kg⁻¹ soil, respectively, in the areas of the plots receiving poultry litter. Soil bulk density in the portions of the plots being grazed had increased significantly also. The soil collected from the forested riparian buffer in 2008 had similar soil bulk densities and Bray 1–extractable P concentrations as the plots did in 2003 before treatments were imposed.

AB  - Riparian zones along forest streams in the western United States have been repeatedly shown to be floristically and climatically different from adjacent upland forest, and to be important contributors to forest biodiversity. Similar evidence for the presence or function of riparian zones is lacking for forests of the northeastern U.S. We conducted seasonal surveys of forest-floor temperature and soil moisture across 30-m riparian transects on first- to third-order streams in southern New England. We were unable to detect any effect of distance from the stream channel on either temperature or soil moisture. These preliminary results indicate the absence of a unique riparian forest-floor microclimate within 30m of low-order streams in southern New England. While this study failed to identify a distinctive riparian microclimatic zone, protection of a riparian buffer during forestry operations or other disturbance is essential for the protection of forest streams and their resources and the maintenance of forest biodiversity.

AB  - The amount of agricultural spray that drifts into a wetland from an adjacent crop field is influenced by vegetation along the field boundary or any intentional setback distance (buffer zone) between the sprayer and the edge of the arable field. In this study, spray tracer drift deposits were measured in a simulated wetland area under different conditions of wind speed and buffer zone width. The effect of an artificial windbreak at the upwind edge of the simulated wetland was also evaluated. A level of tolerance of 0.1% of the in-swath spray deposition was established as a no-effect level for the response of aquatic plants to common herbicides. Our results indicate that a vegetated 10-m field margin (eg a fencerow) alone provides adequate protection from herbicide drift into a wetland area under wind conditions normally considered acceptable for spraying. For high winds (>4 m s-1) when field spraying would not normally be advised, adequate protection was afforded by the same 10-m margin plus a dense windbreak (25% porosity) or by the margin plus a 20-m buffer zone.

AB  - To document the bushmeat trade in the buffer zone of the Haut Niger National Park (HNNP), Republic of Guinea, we monitored the number of carcasses offered for sale in 16 villages over a one year period in 2001. Overall, we counted a total of 9134 carcasses from 27 species. This represents a biomass harvest of about 170,000 kg, a figure that could reach 335,100 kg when game consumed by hunters (i.e. not sold) and markets not sampled are taken into account. Ungulates (eleven species) and rodents (four species) accounted for 53.5% and 24.8% of the carcasses counted respectively (80.8% and 11.4% of the total biomass, respectively). The number of carcasses counted in villages bordering a heavily trafficked road was significantly higher than in more rural villages, thus highlighting the stimulating effect of roads on the bushmeat trade. Compared with existing data collected in 1995, the proportion of ungulates counted in the Mansira Moribaya village in 2001 increased significantly while that of rodents decreased significantly. The harvest of duiker species at Mansira Moribaya was in excess of the maximum sustainable harvest. These results of this study were used to establish a sustainable wildlife management scheme in the HNNP.

AB  - To inform the development of alternative livelihoods, the women's traditional alok fishery in the Campo-Ma'an National Park and buffer zone of southern Cameroon were studied over 15 months. Participatory rural appraisal was used to characterise livelihood strategies among 45 households. Thirty-three cultured crops, nine farmed animal species and 65 non-timber forest products, including 31 bushmeat species are cultivated in, or harvested from, the forest. Transport is a major impediment to commercial trade of all local products. In 16 alok fishing events, average weight of fish harvested was 5.14 kg per 280 m of stream distributed among an average of 23 fishers for a return of 220 g person⁻¹ or 40 g fish h⁻¹ over 5 h of work. Fish and crustacean standing stock was 25 g per linear metre or 167 t when extrapolated to the zone. Implications for rainforest livelihoods in light of the Millennium Development Goals are discussed.

AB  - The specific habitat requirements of harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicusLinnaeus 1758), which breed in the Pacific Northwest, are largely unknown. I capturedand attached radio transmitters to 42 female harlequins (36 paired and 6 unpaired) in thecentral Cascade Range of Oregon in 1994 and 1995. Breeding pairs used 3rd through 5thorder streams but nesting occurred near 1st through 5th order streams. Males returned tothe coastal habitats at the end of May, but females remained on streams during thesummer; non- and failed-nesting females departed in late July through mid-August.Successful hens and young departed in late August. Nests were located for 20 of the 36paired females; 15 of 20 nests were successful. An additional successful nest (of an unmarked hen) was located during the fieldwork. Ninety-five percent of nests hadoverhead cover within 0.75m. Nests were in a variety of forest types ranging in age from30-300 years old. Seven nests were located in the floodplain; 5 were on islands and 2were on streambanks. Four of these nest were on perched on wood debris. Thirteen nestswere above the floodplain; 9 on terraces or cliffs and 4 on side slopes and all were on the ground. Clutches averaged 5.5 eggs with 74% apparent nest success. Duckling survival was 60%, while brood density on streams ranged from 0.15-1.2 brood/km. First to 5thorder streams and riparian buffer zones with diverse habitat types are important whenconsidering harlequin duck management options.

AB  - Poland is obliged, like the other EU countries, to implement the Water Framework Directive – WFD (2000/60/WE) by the end of 2015. The main objective of WFD is to provide normative quality of all water resources. To reach this goal reduction of water polluter emission to the environment is needed. Our project focuses on pollution from agricultural sources which share in global pollution is high and growing still. As a pilot area, where the WFD is going to be implemented, small agricultural Zgłowiączka catchment was chosen. The state monitoring of surface water quality for the catchment is conducted in three points along the Zgłowiaczka River. In each of these three points, nitrates concentration periodically significantly exceeds the allowable value of 50 mg NO3·dm–3. The highest average monthly values of nitrates concentration in years 1990–2007 occur in February, March and April, which indicates on agriculture as a source of pollution. The Zgłowiaczka catchment is an area where reduction of nitrogen run-off from agricultural lands to water resources is especially needed. The main topic of the research carried out in the Polish-Norwegian project is to propose different means for reduction of migration of nitrate to surface water based on modeling approach. In the paper a conception of creating buffer zones using SWAT model is presented. We considered fitting the buffer zone width, depending on the flow rate of water flowing from the fields to the stream. Using SWAT model interface a map of potential flow under the conditions of the intensive precipitation was generated. The next step was distribution over the whole Zgłowiączka catchment, places with high density of the temporal streams network. It was done using GRASS program. The map of stream “density” was done by assigning the raster number which is the sum of raster in the neighbourhood (radius of neighbourhood smaller or equal 25 raster). The choice of the most endangered subbasins was done on base of visual evaluation of the surface flow density map. It is visible in the results that filter strips on endangered areas are far more effective and therefore more required. If the width of the vegetated buffer strips is not sufficient, it will not attain the desired effectiveness. Conversely, if the width is too great, it will cause agricultural land waste, preventing farmers’ interest in cooperating with environmental preservation efforts. For the above reasons, it is important to set a reasonable width range. According to the results we are suggesting wider buffer zones in endangered subbasins and narrow in other subbasins.

AB  - The new methodical approach of ecosystem study of forest dynamics is presented. It is based on systematical sampling on belt transects situated in the site of herb rich mountain fir-beech forest communities in the Dobročský prales National Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. The transects cross various developmental stages as well as different forms of former commercial forests with changed tree composition (predominantly spruce stands). On 94 sample-plots species composition of plant communities is recorded along with registration of macromycetes (including underground stages identified by molecular methods), microclimatic and soil variables. Goal of the research is to find and quantify the influence of anthropogenic changes of tree stands to the species diversity of plant and fungi species.

AB  - In agricoltura biologica, la protezione delle colture dovrebbe essere perseguita piu' attraverso una strategia di prevenzione che di cura. Con una strategia di prevenzione, le infestazioni di fitofagi, fitopatogeni ed erbe infestanti vengono contrastate attraverso una struttura, un funzionamento e una gestione dell'agro-ecosistema piu' plasmati dagli input di informazione che da quelli di energia-materia. I metodi sostenibili di protezione delle colture necessitano di essere basati su una migliore conoscenza dei principi ecologici, specialmente inerenti alle interazioni interspecifiche, ai fattori di scala e ai processi che mimano quelli naturali. Nel quadro di una strategia di prevenzione, la protezione e la produzione delle colture non dovrebbero essere piu' considerate come aree separate di ricerca e gestione, ma come componenti sinergiche di un unico sistema polifunzionale, dove la protezione delle colture e la nutrizione delle piante sono viste come un tutto. L'agricoltura mista, la rotazione delle colture, la consociazione e la gestione delle infrastrutture tra i campi coltivati sono discusse come principali mezzi pratici per aumentare la sostenibilita' nei sistemi di agricoltura biologica

AB  - Landscape effects on arable weed communities have mainly been studied in areas dominated by intensive agricultural land use, while less attention has been paid to the same effects in cultivated fields close to the rural–urban interface. Our objective was to assess the effects of ongoing agricultural land abandonment and urban sprawl on arable weed communities since this is a widespread phenomena in Mediterranean landscapes. Weeds were sampled at three different distances (5, 10, 15m) from the field margin in 21 maize fields located within a 75km² area in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy. Species were aggregated in functional response groups based on chorological categories, Raunkiær life forms and CSR plant strategies. Landscape surrounding each field was assessed in four circular buffers of radii ranging from 250 to 1500m. Attributes characterising fields and field margins were also considered. Community composition and diversity of weed communities were affected by field and landscape characteristics. Old and new abandonment increased species richness and weed diversity but had an opposite effect on the Raunkiær functional response groups. Urban sprawl was positively correlated with abundance of geophytes, competitive and cosmopolite species and negatively correlated with therophytes and competitive-ruderals. Most landscape parameters had stronger effect at the smallest scale. The effect of landscape parameters was clearer when weeds were classified by functional response trait than by taxonomy.

AB  - Riparian treatments, consisting of 3- to 4-m buffer strips, stream bank stabilization, and rock-lined stream crossings, were installed in two streams with livestock grazing to reduce sediment loading and stream bank erosion. Cedar Run and Slab Cabin Run, the treatment streams, and Spring Creek, an adjacent reference stream without riparian grazing, were monitored prior to (1991-1992) and 3-5 years after (2001-2003) riparian buffer installation to assess channel morphology, stream substrate composition, suspended sediments, and macroinvertebrate communities. Few changes were found in channel widths and depths, but channel-structuring flow events were rare in the drought period after restoration. Stream bank vegetation increased from 50% or less to 100% in nearly all formerly grazed riparian buffers. The proportion of fine sediments in stream substrates decreased in Cedar Run but not in Slab Cabin Run. After riparian treatments, suspended sediments during base flow and storm flow decreased 47-87% in both streams. Macroinvertebrate diversity did not improve after restoration in either treated stream. Relative to Spring Creek, macroinvertebrate densities increased in both treated streams by the end of the posttreatment sampling period. Despite drought conditions that may have altered physical and biological effects of riparian treatments, goals of the riparian restoration to minimize erosion and sedimentation were met. A relatively narrow grass buffer along 2.4 km of each stream was effective in improving water quality, stream substrates, and some biological metrics.

AB  - Laboratory and field studies were conducted during the summer-fall season of 1997 to evaluate the potential of the field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus Burmeister as a weed seed predator in annual crops. Laboratory no-choice tests showed that both male and female G. pennsylvanicus readily accepted and consumed seeds of small and large-seeded annual weeds. In 24 h, female and male G. pennsylvanicus consumed an average of 12 and 8 velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), 26 and 9 giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.), 87 and 69 crabgrass [Digitaria Sanguinalis (L.) Scop.], and 223 and 90 redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) seeds, respectively. Tests of pitfall trap sampling in outdoor arenas showed that G. pennsylvanicus is susceptible to this sampling technique. Pitfall traps were subsequently used to monitor activity-density of G. pennsylvanicus in a soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) field and 2 adjacent perennial filter strips, one composed of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and the other an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) mixture. G. pennsylvanicus individuals were first captured in early August, peaked in mid-September, and decreased in October. Field cricket activity-density was greatest in switchgrass filter strip followed by legume-grass filter strip and lowest in soybean.

AB  - In many areas of intensive corn production, atrazine and metolachlor are among the most commonly found herbicides in surface and ground water. This 2-yr study compared the impact of grass and grass+tree buffer strips on the exported masses of atrazine, metolachlor, and a degradation product of atrazine, desethylatrazine (DEA). The experimental system consisted of four replicate plots in a three-way completely randomized design (no buffer zone, grass buffer zone, and grass+tree buffer strips). The field plots were 5 m wide and 30 m long and grown in corn. The grass and grass+tree buffer strips were 5 m and had the same grass vegetation except for eight young hybrid poplars. Over the 2-yr study, surface runoff and subsurface infiltration water (under the buffer strip) were collected after the initial three rainfall events after herbicide application. Dissolved atrazine, metolachlor, and DEA were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The presence of buffer strips decreased the exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff. A three-way ANOVA with treatment (type of buffer strip), water (surface runoff or subsurface infiltration), and time between herbicide application and rainfall event as factors showed a significant reduction (40–60% in 2004 and 75–95% in 2005) in the total (surface runoff+infiltrated water) exported masses of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of buffer strips. Rainfall events after herbicide application were different between the 2 yr and greatly affected the flow distribution (e.g., subsurface infiltration) and the leached herbicide concentrations. No significant difference in the capacity to reduce herbicide exports was observed between grass and grass+tree buffer strip treatments; the poorly developed young poplar biomass at the time of the study may partly explain this observation.

AB  - Environmental regulation of agriculture is becoming increasingly important, and growers are increasingly concerned about the effects of regulations on their profitability.  Regulations governing the use of a pesticide affect its economic value.  Further, growers often face a choice among pesticide alternatives, each with its own set of regulatory restrictions.  In this environment, the introduction of a new regulation can have complex effects on growers' profit-maximizing pesticide choices.  Buffer zones and regional emissions caps mean that pesticide choices can have important spatial components.  Our paper presents an optimization model that incorporates spatial considerations at the field and regional level.

We apply our model to fumigant choice by California strawberry growers.  The industry is facing an impending ban on the use of methyl bromide, which in conjunction with chloropicrin was the standard fumigant for over forty years.  In addition to the forthcoming ban, the state government has imposed regulations governing methyl bromide application, including buffer zones, etc.  These extreme use restrictions provide us with an interesting environment for modeling the effects of pesticide regulations.   There are currently two legally available fumigants that may substitute for methyl bromide in strawberries:  1,3-D and chloropicrin.  1, 3-D is subject to township caps and other restrictions.  Township caps limit total application in an area.  The California Department of Pesticide Regulation is currently undertaking air monitoring and other activities to determine whether or not buffer zones and other restrictions should be applied to chloropicrin.  We evaluate the effects of current and proposed regulations on field-level decisions and industry costs and returns.

Methodology
To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the role of pesticide use regulations in determining growers' profit-maximizing pesticide choices at the field level.  We do so by combining three datasets with a field-level spatial model of the profit-maximizing fumigation decision.  The first dataset includes detailed field-level information regarding the costs and yields associated with alternative fumigants obtained from a multi-disciplinary research project.  The second includes chemical-specific California use regulations regarding treatment rates, buffer zones, and other restrictions.  The third includes information on the shapes and sizes of strawberry fields in California.   Using these data, the optimization model computes the profit-maximizing treatment for each field including pattern of treatment and number of acres treated per day, etc.  Field-level results are aggregated to evaluate the impact of regional pesticide regulations, and then to estimate the industry-level effects of current and proposed pesticide use regulations.  

We model the effects of the entire regulatory system on the fumigation decisions made by farmers.  The restrictions on fumigants are integrated into a field-level programming model of a grower's fumigant decision choice.  The program calculates the optimal fumigation plan for a field, given the field's size and shape, and use regulations, and per-acre costs and returns associated with each fumigant. The resulting field-level choices are aggregated in order to check for consistency with township caps.  If caps are exceeded, the model is rerun using a number of allocation rules.  All choices for all fields are aggregated in order to obtain industry-level results.  We perform this procedure for the current set of restrictions and for several alternative sets, assessing the profitability of each alternative.  For example, we remove the existing township caps on 1,3-D and evaluate how much the results change.  We include varying buffer zone restrictions on chloropicrin, and evaluate whether growers' fumigant choices are sensitive to the size of the buffer zone.   

Relevance
Environmental regulation of agriculture is becoming increasingly important.  By explicitly analyzing the effect of regulations affecting methyl bromide alternatives in a model that  includes both the spatial dimensions of some regulations and the costs and yields associated with each alternative, we will obtain a more detailed and accurate assessment of the costs of these regulations than is currently available.  Our results will provide a greater understanding of the effects of these regulations on industry profitability, and how these regulations interact.  

Our model can be applied to other cases of pesticide regulations.  Given the increasing importance of environmental regulation in agriculture, it is important to aid policymakers in understanding how regulations interact with each other, possibly in unexpected ways.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for determining optimal planting recommendations for bottomlands and riparian buffer strips within a geographic information system (GIS) framework. The specific objective of this study was the development of a decision support model to generate riparian tree-planting recommendations based on site characteristics. Unlike previous research, this study enhances the usefulness of conventional site evaluation guides by incorporating digital soil surveys and other spatial data at a level of detail and automation previously unavailable. Research was conducted in the Cypress Creek Quadrangle, southern Illinois, and planting recommendations were generated for eight bottomland hardwood species. Model results were consistent with accepted silvicultural recommendations. Species were consistently placed within sites most suitable for each individual's requirements, and as a result, model recommendations should produce riparian forests optimizing growth potential. By adopting this approach, more productive forest cover could be established while concurrently reducing costs associated with on-site evaluations.

AB  - In workshops with four indigenous communities in the Embera-Katíos communal lands (resguardo) , located in the upper San Jorge River Valley (Tres Playitas, Las Piedras, Boca San Cipriano, San Juan Medio), information about the wild fauna that they recognized inside their hunting grounds was collected. Mammals, reptiles, and birds, especially the Psittacidae family, are the vertebrates most used by the indigenous communities. No kind of use was found for amphibians. The consumption of reptiles such as Iguana iguana, Tupinambis teguixin, Caiman crocodylus fuscus, and Crocodylus acutus show them to be an important part of their culture. The indigenous communities associate environmental problems with habitat destruction due to the cultivation of illicit crops and forest clearing in the buffer zone around Paramillo National Park.

AB  - The development of effective techniques to eradicate populations of invasive ant species is crucial to the conservation of native biodiversity. An intensive program was initiated in 2001 to eradicate the invasive little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) from approximately 21 ha on Marchena Island in the Galápagos Archipelago. Linear transects, approximately 10 m apart, were cut through the vegetation of the infested area and a buffer zone of 6 ha. Amdro (Hydramethylnon) was applied manually up to three times in the treatment area at three-month intervals between March and October 2001. To date, five follow-up monitoring surveys have placed sticks painted with peanut butter in a grid 3-4 m apart. Two small populations (0.1% of the area originally occupied by W. auropunctata) were detected in April and October 2002 and were subsequently treated with Amdro®. No W. auropunctata ants were found in May 2003 and April 2004. Five nocturnal surveys carried out in the immediate area of introduction of W. auropunctata did not detect any individuals. Monitoring surveys will continue for an additional two years to ensure eradication of any remaining populations and verify the success of this program. This paper discusses the procedures used to kill W. auropunctata and monitor the efficacy of the eradication methods, the program's costs, and its applicability to other island ecosystems.

AB  - Effects of light and disturbance on species diversity and vegetation succession were assessed during early succession of newly created sown and unsown field margin strips installed along the sunny and shady side of a tree lane. During succession, disturbance by farming operations was simulated by a single rotocultivation of the margin strip. Two years after the disturbance event, species richness was not significantly determined by light regime or disturbance level. However, shortly after the disturbance event, disturbance caused a temporary increase in species richness on the unshaded side due to introgression by annual species in created gaps. On the shaded side, species richness was significantly lower in disturbed plots. Disturbance caused a temporary increase in importance of spontaneous annuals, which were quickly replaced by perennial sown and unsown monocotyledons and to a lesser extent by perennial unsown dicotyledons. The importance of spontaneous species within functional groups increased, resulting in higher similarity between sown and unsown vegetation.

AB  - For two or more classes (or types) of points, nearest neighbor contingency tables (NNCTs) are constructed using nearest neighbor (NN) frequencies and are used in testing spatial segregation of the classes. Pielou's test of independence, Dixon's cell-specific, class-specific, and overall tests are the tests based on NNCTs (i.e., they are NNCT-tests). These tests are designed and intended for use under the null pattern of random labeling (RL) of completely mapped data. However, it has been shown that Pielou's test is not appropriate for testing segregation against the RL pattern while Dixon's tests are. In this article, we compare Pielou's and Dixon's NNCT-tests; introduce the one-sided versions of Pielou's test; extend the use of NNCT-tests for testing complete spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called CSR independence, henceforth). We assess the finite sample performance of the tests by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study and demonstrate that Dixon's tests are also appropriate for testing CSR independence; but Pielou's test and the corresponding one-sided versions are liberal for testing CSR independence or RL. Furthermore, we show that Pielou's tests are only appropriate when the NNCT is based on a random sample of (base, NN) pairs. We also prove the consistency of the tests under their appropriate null hypotheses. Moreover, we investigate the edge (or boundary) effects on the NNCT-tests and compare the buffer zone and toroidal edge correction methods for these tests. We illustrate the tests on a real life and an artificial data set.

AB  - Monitoring bird populations is labour-intensive and requires expert knowledge. Development of more cost-effective methods of bird species monitoring is therefore desirable. Simple rule-based (RB) models were developed that predicted the presence of birds in lowland arable farmland in the breeding season. These were based on the presence of key habitat elements required by the birds identified from the literature. Habitat data and bird data were collected independently from 525 transects each of which ran along a field margin. Model performance was tested in five species: grey partridge Perdix perdix, skylark Alauda arvensis, linnet Carduelis cannabina, corn bunting Miliaria calandra and yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. RB models were not good predictors of species presence. Model performance did not vary appreciably between early or late breeding season or according to geographic region. Skylark had the best performing model, but even in this case the predictive power was low. Prediction of species presence from habitat survey data is therefore unlikely to be a cost-effective method of monitoring birds on British farmland.

AB  - The Feitsui reservoir is a major water supply source for more than five million people in Northern Taiwan. The reservoir water quality has been good, but is threatened by eutrophication due to excessive nutrient input and siltation due to sediment loads. Recently, the water authorities in Taiwan have made considerable efforts to devise strategies using watershed conservation practices for the protection of Feitsui reservoir water quality. The control of non-point source pollution (NPS) represents one of the major strategies and the use of best management practices (BMPs) is under careful consideration. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost of a full Feitsui watershed implementation of riparian buffer strips and other appropriate conservation practices. Based on the use of watershed simulation models and a statistical relationship between pollution reduction rate and the width and slope of a buffer strip, a methodology for the planning and design of riparian buffer strips was addressed. Data from field experiments were used to calibrate the coefficients of the regression equations. Several planning scenarios were evaluated by means of cost-benefit analysis coupled with net present value method. Data on local construction and maintenance costs for the selected design and location of buffer strips were used in the analysis. Based on several cost-benefit analyses, the scenario for installing buffer strips with 30 m width and 5% slope along both sides of tributary streams in the sub-watersheds with high nutrient (phosphorus) loadings was found to be most cost effective.

AB  - Study on effect of stand density on growth and yield of 11 and 12 year old Azadirachta indica A. Juss. Var. siamensis Valeton plantations was carried out at Ratchaburi Forest Experiment Station, Ratchaburi Province. The experimental stands were planted with eight different planting density : 40,000, 17,778, 10,000, 4,445, 2,500, 625, 278  and 157 trees/ha. The data collection was done on October in 1994 and 1995. Enumeration of all trees was done and the diameter at ground level (Do), diameter at breast height (D) of each tree in each stand density were measured. Three sample trees representing the man tree of each D class of the whole planting density were cut down from the buffer zone of the experimental plot following the stratified clip technique method and their roots digged up. Biomass of each part per tree and yield of each part per unit area were estimated for 2 age classes. The study revealed that growth in forms of mean diameter at ground level and at breast height tended to increase as tree density decreased in both 2 age classes. Maximum and minimum sizes of trees were found in 157 trees/ha and 40,000 trees/ha plots respectively. The survival percentages of trees also showed the similar trend. Biomass of each part per tree tended to decrease with the rising of stand density. Maximum and minimum biomass per tree were found in 157 trees/ha and 40,000 trees/ha plots respectively. Yield of each part per unit area were positively increased with the increasing of stand density up to the maximum in 10,000 trees/ha stand density and beyond this they tended to decrease as stand density increased.

AB  - Non-point source pollution (NPSP) has become a critical pollution source after many improvements in point source pollution treatment have been made, particularly in China, due to intensive agricultural activities. Moreover, the impact of NPSP on surface water quality is significantly affected by extreme events, such as flooding. In this study, the soil and water assessment tool model was used to characterize the behaviours of NPSPs and to evaluate the effect of filter strips during flooding periods. The results showed that a flooding event in 2002 caused by a long duration of rainfall (event_1) contributed approximately 40 % of the annual sediment and organic N yield and 18.4 % of nitrate N yield. In 2007, more than 50 % of the annual sediment and organic N and 20 % of nitrate N export were caused by a flooding event due to heavy rainfall (event_2). The simulation results highlighted the severe threat of flooding events on aquatic environments. Furthermore, filter strips of different widths were simulated in these flooding scenarios to test their mitigation effects on the deterioration of surface water quality during these two events, and the 10-m filter strip did decrease more than 30–40 % of the loads of all NPSPs. Our study stresses that more attention should be paid to assessing the impact of flooding events on water quality management measures and pollution loads, as well as the effect of management practices on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to develop sustainable water and soil resources.

AB  - Implementing a suite of best management practices (BMPs) can reduce non-point source (NPS) pollutants from various land use activities. Watershed models are generally used to evaluate the effectiveness of BMP performance in improving water quality as the basis for watershed management recommendations. This study evaluates 171 management practice combinations that incorporate nutrient management, vegetated filter strips (VFS) and grazing management for their performances in improving water quality in a pasture-dominated watershed with dynamic land use changes during 1992&ndash;2007 by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). These selected BMPs were further examined with future climate conditions (2010&ndash;2069) downscaled from three general circulation models (GCMs) for understanding how climate change may impact BMP performance. Simulation results indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) losses increase with increasing litter application rates. Alum-treated litter applications resulted in greater TN losses, and fewer TP losses than the losses from untreated poultry litter applications. For the same litter application rates, sediment and TP losses are greater for summer applications than fall and spring applications, while TN losses are greater for fall applications. Overgrazing management resulted in the greatest sediment and phosphorus losses, and VFS is the most influential management practice in reducing pollutant losses. Simulations also indicate that climate change impacts TSS losses the most, resulting in a larger magnitude of TSS losses. However, the performance of selected BMPs in reducing TN and TP losses was more stable in future climate change conditions than in the BMP performance in the historical climate condition. We recommend that selection of BMPs to reduce TSS losses should be a priority concern when multiple uses of BMPs that benefit nutrient reductions are considered in a watershed. Therefore, the BMP combination of spring litter application, optimum grazing management and filter strip with a VFS ratio of 42 could be a promising alternative for use in mitigating future climate change.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) does not fully simulate riparian buffers, but has a simple filter function that is responsive to filter strip width (FILTERW). The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate SWAT hydrology and water quality response to changes in watershed subdivision levels and different FILTERW configurations and (2) provide guidance for selecting appropriate watershed subdivision for model runs that include the riparian buffer feature through the FILTERW parameter. Watershed subdivision level is controlled by the critical source area (CSA) which defines the minimum drainage area required to form the origin of a stream. SWAT was calibrated on a 15.7 km2 subdrainage within the Little River Experimental Watershed, Georgia. The calibrated parameter set was applied to 32 watershed configurations consisting of four FILTERW representations for each of eight CSA levels. Streamflow predictions were stable regardless of watershed subdivision and FILTERW configuration. Predicted sediment and nutrient loads from upland areas decreased as CSA increased when spatial variations of riparian buffers are considered. Sediment and nutrient yield at the watershed outlet was responsive to different combinations of CSA and FILTERW depending on selected in-stream processes. CSA ranges which provide stable sediment and nutrient yields at the watershed outlet was suggested for avoiding significant modifications in selected parameter set.

AB  - We assessed the ecological structure and function of mountain ridges connected to a reserve area, Gwangneung Royal Tomb Forest (GRTF), in central Korea. This site has been strictly preserved since the 15th century. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the interactions between and the influence of a protected old-growth forest on its surrounding forests, and 2) suggest management strategies for forests outside that reserve area. Three ridges were surveyed and divided into two categories -- A and B ridges covered with secondary forests connected to GRTF, and the C ridge, covered with primary forests and plantations within GRTF (from core zone to managed zone). The ridge forests had a characteristic lobe shape. We found no significant decline in species richness (peninsular effect) with distance from GRTF for any tree-layer or herbaceous-layer species on Ridges A or B. However, when only the species that appeared in primary forests on the C ridge were considered, the richness of tree- and herbaceous-layer species was significantly decreased there. This meant that the neighboring forests of GRTF could serve as a buffer zone. Differences were obvious between the two categorized forests in their species composition, species richness, basal area, and regeneration patterns. DCA ordination of quadrats on Ridges A and B showed that Axis 1 was significantly correlated with distance from GRTF, indicating that this protected area affects regeneration within neighboring forests. Thus, reserves are important not only to the conservation of biodiversity, but also to the ecological management of surrounding forests.

AB  - The transient and rapid expression system of a foreign protein in planta is a very useful technique in biotechnology application. We have investigated optimum condition of Agrobacterium-infiltration technique in which expression level of foreign proteins were maximized without detrimental effects on plants using GFP and Cucumber mosaic virus 2b protein, which is known as an enhancer of gene expression and a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). The optimum expression level of both RNA and protein of GFP with minimum leaf impairment was obtained at OD∧600=0.2 of Agrobactrium inocula. The steady-state levels of GFP RNA and protein generally peaked at 3 and 7 days post-infiltration (dpi), respectively. In the presence of 2b, both the magnitude and duration of GFP expression was highly increased and we could detect GFP level until 17 dpi. On the other hands, the 2b-mediated higher accumulation of foreign proteins resulted in the repression of normal leaf growth, possibly due to the limitation of supply of energy or materials required for growth maintenance. Using this Agrobacterium-infiltration system with 2b and GFP, we tested a hypothesis for the threshold model of PTGS initiation. Four GFP transgenic lines of N. benthamiana, which shows different expression level of GFP were tested to determine the threshold level for PTGS initiation. Agrobacterium-infiltration of GFP into those GFP-transgenic plants resulted in the co-silencing of the transgenic GFP. It was found that very low concentration of Agrobacterium with GFP and GFP+2b (OD∧600=0.002-0.02) which could not phenotypically induce an additive GFP expression, was enough to trigger PTGS pathway in all GFP transgenic plants. This strongly indicates that each GFP-transgenic plant should be expressing the transgenic GFP at its own pre-determined level and there was no buffer zone of additive GFP-expression to the threshold. In other words, the PTGS seems to be immediately activated as a self-defensive mechanism if an internal balance of gene expression is broken.

AB  - Traditional systems of medicine have become a topic of global importance recently. Increased commercialization of economically important medicinal plants has resulted in overharvesting, threatening their survival. The present study was carried out to document the indigenous uses of medicinal plants by the local communities in and around Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh. Data collection was predominantly qualitative recording the species use, identifying their relative importance (RI) and assessing the informants' consensus factor (Fic) on associated knowledge. We interviewed 140 households of the local community and 5 local herbal practitioners. A total of 44 plant species were in use to treat 33 ailments under 10 broad disease categories. Five species were found to have high use versatility (RI > 1), Emblica officinale L. being the most versatile. Respiratory problems scored the highest Fic value (0.56) involving the use of 30% of the species recorded. Terminalia bellerica Roxb., Sterculia villosa Roxb., Dillenia pentagyna Roxb. and Terminalia arjuna Bedd. were being harvested commercially. Use by the community, particularly for subsistence consumption, seemed to be sustainable, but commercial extraction of some species appeared unsustainable. Buffer zone-based commercial farming of medicinal plants with a commercial value could serve a dual purpose of assuring sustainable alternative income generation for local communities as well as conserving the natural resources in protected areas.

AB  - This study compared the spatial and temporal patterns of Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Aedes vexans Meigen populations and examined their relationships with land cover types and climatic variability in Sioux Falls, SD. Between 24 and 30 CDC CO2-baited light traps were set annually in Sioux Falls from May to September 2005–2008. Land cover data were acquired from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset and the percentages of selected land cover types were calculated within a 600-m buffer zone around each trap. Meteorological information was summarized from local weather stations. Cx. tarsalis exhibited stronger spatial autocorrelation than Ae. vexans. Land cover analysis indicated that Cx. tarsalis was positively correlated with grass/hay, and Ae. vexans was positively correlated with wetlands. No associations were identified between irrigation and the host-seeking population of each species. Higher temperature in the current week and 2 wk prior and higher precipitation 3–4 wk before collection of host-seeking adult mosquitoes had positive influences on Cx. tarsalis abundance. Temperature in the current week and rainfall 2–3 wk before sampling had positive influences on Ae. vexans abundance. This study revealed the different influences of weather and land cover on important mosquito species in the Northern Great Plains region, which can be used to improve local vector control strategies and West Nile virus prevention efforts.

AB  - Forty-six independent stream reaches in southeastern Pennsylvania were surveyed to assess the relationships between geomorphic and habitat variables and watershed total impervious area (TIA) and to test the ability of the impervious cover model (ICM) to predict the impervious category based on stream reach variables. Ten variables were analyzed using simple and multivariate statistical techniques including scatterplots, Spearman\'s Rank correlations, principal components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Graphical analysis suggested differences in the response to TIA between the stream reaches with less than 13 percent TIA and those with greater than 24 percent TIA. Spearman\'s Rank correlations showed significant relationships for large woody debris and sinuosity when analyzing the entire dataset and for depth diversity and the standard deviation of maximum pool depths when analyzing stream reaches with greater than 24 percent TIA. Classification into the ICM using DA was 49 percent accurate; however, the stream reaches did support the ICM in other ways. These results indicate that stream reach response to urbanization may not be consistent across geographical regions and that local conditions (specifically riparian buffer vegetation) may significantly affect channel response; and the ICM, used in the appropriate context, can aid in the management of stream reaches and watersheds.

AB  - Soil erosion control is a major issue in agriculture. The no till system of soybean production has been widely adopted; however, soil erosion may increase due to pasture and forestry land convertion to cropland in the marginal Pampas, Argentina. The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423km²) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion, sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming, compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation–consensus process.

AB  - Marine reserves are widely used throughout the world to prevent overfishing and conserve biodiversity, but uncertainties remain about their optimal design. The effects of marine reserves are heterogeneous. Despite theoretical findings, empirical studies have previously found no effect of size on the effectiveness of marine reserves in protecting commercial fish stocks. Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning.

AB  - 1.Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known.2.Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time.3.Post-treatment (2000-2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined.4.This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before-after control-intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Vegetated riparian buffers are critical for protecting aquatic and terrestrial processes and habitats in southern Appalachian ecosystems. In this case study, we examined the effect of riparian buffer width on stream water quality following upland forest management activities in four headwater catchments. Three riparian buffer widths were delineated prior to cutting; 0m (no-buffer), 10m, and 30m, and one reference site (REF). A two-age prescription timber harvest was conducted on all cut sites with a target residual basal area of approximately 4.0m2ha−1. Harvesting occurred from October 2005 through February 2007. Stream sampling was conducted weekly from January 2004 through December 2008. Stream water chemistry, temperature, and total suspended solids (TSS) were used as metrics of water quality. Analyses were conducted on weekly grab samples. Pre-treatment concentrations of all solutes were similar to conditions found in other headwater streams at similar topographic positions around the region. The greatest responses to cutting occurred on the no-buffer site. Compared with pre-harvest levels on the no-buffer site, stream nitrate concentration ([NO3–N]) increased 2-fold during both base and stormflow following harvest, and all base cations increased in concentration. [NO3–N] on the no-buffer site showed steady decline with time following the initial post-harvest increase. The other sites did not show increases in [NO3–N] and very small or no responses in other stream chemistry parameters. There was no TSS response at stormflow on any site, and during baseflow, TSS decreased on all but the no-buffer site. Stream water temperature increased during the summer on the no-buffer site. Although alternative land uses may have different requirements, these results suggest that for riparian buffer widths of 10m and wider, the forest harvest activities implemented in this study did not substantially impact stream water quality. Hence, 10m wide buffers in these ecosystems may provide effective protection with respect to stream water chemistry, TSS, and temperature.

AB  - The use of riparian buffer strips as a means of reducing diffuse pollution in European grassland systems is becoming more common and consequently there is a need for comprehensive research on the influence of buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity. Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (>5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (<2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.

AB  - The creation of parks and preserves in less developed countries is seen as an important step in preserving biodiversity and genetic information (Dixon and Sherman 1990). The establishment of a park or preserve, however, is often seen as a threat by rural residents if they are denied access to areas where hunting, gathering or small scale agricultural provided them with food, fuel or marketable products. In a series of papers Norgaard (1981, 1984 and 1985) advocates development strategies that promote coevolution of socioeconomic and ecological systems. In this dynamic context, coevolution might be defined by a set of trajectories describing economic welfare and biodiversity that remain within "acceptable" bounds over some future horizon. (1) What are some possible measures for economic welfare and biodiversity? (2) How might one identify the scale and location of hunting, gathering and agricultural activities within a buffer zone to a park or preserve that would qualify as coevolutionary? (3) How might one optimize over the set of coevolutionary strategies? A methodology is proposed to address these questions and to explore the economic incentives that might support a coevolutionary strategy in the buffer zone to a park or preserve.

AB  - Dysart Woods is a predominantly oak and hickory old-growth forest that was given to Ohio University by The Nature Conservancy for research and public use. After a long discussion in the government and against the desires of the environmental organizations that opposed mining in the vicinity of this forest, a permit was issued and the Dysart Woods watershed is being undermined via longwall mining methods and the old-growth forest areas are being undermined via room-and-pillar mining methods. Buffer zones based upon the angle of influence have been placed around Dysart Woods to protect it from the influence of longwall mining. While this concept is sufficient for architectural structures it was not designed to prevent changes in hydrogeologic properties that typically accompany underground mining. The purpose of this work is to assess hydrogeologic impacts in a watershed context beyond the recharge area delineated by a buffer zone that has been determined by the angle of influence. Results of the physical model show that the water table elevations of the northeast portion of the water table of the shallowest aquifer underneath the Dysart Woods watershed have lowered as a result to longwall mining. Results of transient numerical modeling show a decline in the calculated heads from pre-mining head elevations to post-mining head elevations inside the buffer zone proposed by the mining company. The transient simulation was modeled to 12/1/2014, which showed that the upper hydrostratigraphic units dried up as a result of underground mining. If perching layers do not recover with time, this could have detrimental effects on Dysart Woods. This suggests new considerations for underground mining regulations with respect to preserving ecosystems that are dependent on groundwater systems. In particular, the groundwater system protection zone should be defined on the basis of watershed-scale hydrology as opposed to buffer zones based on the angle of influence.

AB  - The ability of the CREAMS model to predict loadings of runoff, sediment and nutrients from a New Zealand grazed pasture was evaluated. Before use, CREAMS was adapted to better represent N and P cycling in grazed pastures and the seasonal variation in hydraulic conductivity observed at the site. There was a moderately strong relationship (r2 = 0.81) between daily surface runoff volumes predicted by this modified model and volumes measured at the site for 62 events over a three and one half year period. Although the ability of the model to predict daily losses of sediment and nutrients was considerably less (r2  0.45), the model was always an unbiased predictor. This unbiased predictive ability provides good estimates of losses over longer time scales (e.g., seasonal) which is often sufficient when evaluating the impacts of land use practices on water quality. The adapted CREAMS model successfully simulated measured reductions in edge-of-field losses of sediment and nutrient upon installation of a vegetated filter strip. We conclude that although CREAMS has limitations in representing the dynamics of grazed pastures, it shows potential as a water quality management tool in pastoral watersheds

AB  - Surveys were performed along paired transects running from the boundary to the field core and with and without sown grass strips. Their presence affected weed assemblages in the boundaries and over the first metre of the field margins as well as the patterns of weed species distribution. Sown grass strip effect always significantly explained the weed species assemblage in boundaries (23.6%), crop edges (28.4%) and field margins (8.1%) but not in field cores. Sown grass strips enlarged the habitat of boundary species (Plantago lanceolata, Arrhenatherum elatius, Carex sp.). They limited the spread of some species into the field (e.g. Sonchus asper, Anagallis arvensis). Some species were favoured by the establishment of sown grass strips (e.g. Cirsium arvense, Bromus sp., Elytrigia repens). However, sown grass strips acted as a buffer zone for arable species (Alopecurus myosuroides, Viola tricolor, Capsella bursa-pastoris), preventing them to extend their habitat from the fields to the boundaries. With short-term consideration, the establishment of sown grass strips puts areas of arable land aside, but offers an opportunity for many plant species to enlarge their habitat without increasing weediness.

AB  - It was hypothesized that the type and height of riparian vegetation would affect its ability to filter and retain inorganic nitrogen (nitrate-nitrogen (NO3(-)-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), and inorganic phosphorus (phosphate-phosphorus (PO4(-3)-P)). A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used to evaluate 2 montane riparian communities as filters for removing NO3(-)-N, NH4(+)-N, and PO4(-3)-P nutrients from sediment laden overland flow water. One riparian community was characterized by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) Beauv.), while the second community was dominated by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata Stokes) and water sedge (Carex aquatilus Wahl.). Three vegetation height treatments were evaluated: control (natural condition),  moderate treatment (clipped to 10-cm height and clipped material removed),  and heavy treatment (clipped to ground level, clipped material removed, and litter vacuumed up). A 10-m wide riparian buffer zone was an efficient filter as about 84% NO3(-)-N and 79% PO4(-3)-P was removed from the applied water and sediment. However, there were no consistent differences among specific vegetation height treatments or communities in the removal of N and P nutrients.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips are managed for the enhancement of water quality through control of non point source pollution.Denitrification in riparian buffer strips is thought to be the major process -with nitrate uptake by plant growth- that reduces nitrate input in surface water. We investigated the Denitrifier Enzyme Activity (DEA) to test how the buffer strip management modifies the denitrification process. The experimental site is composed of a crop field and a 11 m wide grassed buffer strip at the border between the crop field and a tributary to the Attert river, South-East Belgium. Soil samples from the crop field and the buffer strip have been submitted to different imposed conditions combining glucose, nitrate and water saturation to investigate how antecedent water regime, nitrate and carbon content affect denitrification.The work included DEA measurements on undisturbed soil cores freshly sampled. Experiments on undisturbed soil cores identify the buffer strip as more effective in denitrification (p < 0.001) than the cropped field. However, experiments on samples conditioned under imposed carbon and/or nitrate contents emphasised the importance of micro-topography.

AB  - Questa indagine pone l'attenzione su alcune aree naturali relitte censite all'interno dei confini dei comuni satelliti alla città di Catania. Vengono menzionati taluni interventi rivolti al rinnovo dell'aspetto degradato delle città, anche mediante l'ampliamento del verde pubblico e la salvaguardia delle aree naturali relitte all'interno dei confini comunali. Vogliamo evidenziare che, nel corso degli ultimi anni, il capoluogo ha sviluppato talune innovazioni sociali ed economiche, che hanno apportato considerevoli modificazioni territoriali e un diversificato rapporto con la cintura dei comuni limitrofi. Lo studio mostra la composizione di un'area metropolitana ampia, impiantata su un sistema di comuni che gravitano intorno al capoluogo, che ha portato nel tempo a una conseguente e inarrestabile perdita della naturalità dei luoghi interessati dalle opere di urbanizzazione a spese di una progressiva riduzione degli spazi naturali. Le considerazioni avanzate sulla funzione assunta dalle aree naturali residue ricadenti nel territori, alcune delle quali attualmente sottoposte a vincoli di tutela, propongono l'individuazione di "aree cuscinetto" (Buffer Zone) e di una cintura verde periurbana, opportunamente ramificata all'interno del tessuto urbano che, al tempo stesso, sia in stretta connessione con un'area cuscinetto vicina, così da contribuire al miglioramento della qualità dell'ambiente

AB  - Limitation of the spread of bovine tuberculosis by brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand involves creating buffer zones 3-5 km wide around areas where the disease is endemic in possum populations; low possum density is established by aerial and ground poisoning and maintained by repeated control. The effectiveness of a buffer zone was examined using live-trapping and radio-tracking to study movements and dispersal of juvenile and adult possums in comparison with a nearby, undisturbed (control) site. At a third site, the effect of a s-km long, 9-strand electric fence, erected from ridge to ridge across a valley catchment, for reducing possum dispersal was measured, as an alternative to a buffer zone. Adult possums were highly sedentary; only one permanent shift of more the 0.5 km was detected during repeated live-trapping and radio-tracking, and most consecutive live captures were in traps less than 200 m apart. None of the radio-tagged adults adjacent to the poison buffer zones moved permanently into the low-density areas. By contrast, about 20 percent of radio-tagged juveniles dispersed more than 0.5 km, moving up to 11.6 km from their natal areas, most in a generally west-north-west to east-north-east direction. Neither the poison buffer zone nor the electric fence appeared to influence the proportion of juveniles that dispersed more than 0.5 km, or the average distance dispersed.

AB  - Many species of wildlife depend on riparian habitats for various life-history functions (e.g., breeding, foraging, overwintering). Although this unique habitat is critical for many species, delineations of riparian zones and buffers for various taxa are lacking. Typically when buffer zones are determined to mitigate edge effects, they are based on criteria that protect aquatic resources alone and do not consider impacts to wildlife and other terrestrial resources. Using two different survey methods (area-constrained daytime searches and nighttime visual encounter searches), we estimated core terrestrial habitat and buffer widths for stream-breeding salamanders in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2004. A core terrestrial habitat of 27.0 m encompassed 95% of the salamander assemblage (four species of stream plethodontids), and an additional 50 m (to buffer edge effects) yielded a total buffer of 77.0 m. When each species of the assemblage was analyzed separately, the maximum core terrestrial habitat needed for the Blue Ridge two-lined salamander (Eurycea wilderae), a dominant member and the farthest-ranging species from the stream, was 42.6 m. Thus, we recommend an overall buffer width of 92.6 m in southern Appalachian streams. To protect stream amphibians and other wildlife dependent on riparian areas, land managers and policy makers must consider conserving more than aquatic resources alone. Developing core terrestrial habitat estimates and buffer zone widths for wildlife populations is a critical first step in the conservation of many semiaquatic organisms and protecting biodiversity.

AB  - The status quo in forestry practice is to leave standard width buffers around water bodies in order to prevent the excess transport of sediments and nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. This practice does not seem to be effective in the sub-humid boreal forest where climatic and physiographic variability produces complex hydrologic pathways not well protected by standard width buffers. We developed a remote sensing technique that forms a hydrologic basis for buffer strip design. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was used to map, both inundated and saturated areas (herein called wet areas) amenable for surface transport of nutrients and sediments on a low relief landscape in northern Alberta, Canada. Wet areas coverage of the Moose Lake drainage basin showed a semi-logarithmic relationship with daily discharge (r ² =0.72, p <0.001, n =18). This relationship was used to define a flow-duration curve for wet areas that could be used as an aspatial assessment of what proportion of a drainage basin should be protected. A probability map of wet areas formation was calculated from the database of 18 images. We demonstrated how the probability map may be used to design adaptive buffer strips for the mitigation of increased nutrient loading to boreal lakes following timber harvesting.

AB  - Uncropped, cultivated field boundary strips have been advocated for conserving annual, arable plant communities. Field experiments were set up at three sites on light or chalky soils to test different sequences over a 3-year period of cultivation timing (September or March) and depth (deep or shallow), in replicated field margin plots. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) plant communities with a large component of annuals and dicotyledons are maintained over a 3-year period, (2) species whose germination period coincides with the timing of cultivation are favoured, (3) species with short- or long-lived seeds are favoured, respectively, by shallow or deep cultivation and (4) species composition is affected by the cultivations applied in both the current and previous year. The main components of the vegetation were annuals and dicotyledons. Monocotyledon cover increased from ca. 1-10% to 30% by year 3; the number of monocotyledon species also increased. Cover and number of perennial species increased at two sites. Annuals and dicotyledons showed varying trends between sites. The increase in monocotyledon species numbers was always greatest after shallow cultivations and perennials always increased irrespective of depth. Obligate autumn germinators tended to increase after September cultivations and spring germinators after March cultivations at two sites. A seedbank persistence index declined more after shallow than deep cultivations at two sites. Timing and depth of the most recent cultivation had the strongest effect on species composition. There was also a small residual effect of timing or depth from the previous cultivation. The strong plant community response to each cultivation episode will enable farmers to enhance spatial and temporal species diversity simply by varying the cultivation timing and depth between sites in a given year and over time at the same site. However, continued increase of monocotyledons and perennials over longer periods would be of concern and intervention might be necessary to control them.

AB  - There have been no previous risk assessment studies on citrus pesticides in Spain. The aim of this work was to estimate the risks caused by worst-case drift scenarios of the principal pesticides used on the crop, assessing possible damage to the environment and human health. A field survey was carried out, characterizing the specific conditions of plant protection product applications to citrus crops in Spain. Six targets were identified as being the most affected by droplet spray drift in Spain, and more broadly in most Mediterranean conditions: aquatic organisms, earthworms, bees, adult bystanders, child bystanders and residents. Three drift estimation models were used to assess the amount of drift at specific distances downwind of a field in order to calculate Risk Indicators. These showed safe conditions for earthworms and residents, but also indicated that some pesticides may pose a risk to aquatic organisms, even with a 20 m buffer zone, and also to bees, and adult and child bystanders. In general, results generated similar consequences of hazard risk independent of the drift prediction model used, indicating that toxicological data are more relevant for predicting risks.

AB  - We demonstrated that nearshore spawning and incubation habitats of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are manifestations of lenses of coarse overburden materials underlying the nearshore zone. Lenses directed and accelerated groundwater flow into the habitats. They were < 17 m wide, > 1 m thick, and could be restricted to the nearshore zone or extend at least 20 m into the terrestrial catchment. Recharge areas necessary to sustain discharge in the habitats were estimated to encompass 3-10 ha, or 1-97%, of the associated terrestrial catchment. A 90-m buffer zone adjacent to the shoreline protected only 9-55% of the required recharge area. A hydrological approach to defining habitat protection measures is suggested.

AB  - The thermal regimes in streambed substrates used by brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchell, for incubation of embryos were examined in reference and treatment (0- and 20-m riparian buffer strips) streams in a clear-cut harvested, northern temperate forest of western Newfoundland. In these streams, incubation habitats (redds) were primarily composed of downwelling surface waters with variable but minor mixing of upwelling groundwater. The resulting incubation temperatures were cold (<1 degrees C) and surface water temperatures were accurate predictors of redd temperatures. Both treatment streams displayed evidence of warming in the fall and spring of the 2 years beginning the year of initial harvesting. The increase was most pronounced in the stream without a riparian buffer strip. Clear-cut harvesting with and without a riparian buffer strip altered the thermal regime of surface water and the hyporheic zone in this northern temperate forest where, in addition to salmonid incubation, many biological processes take place. The potential for impacts on stream ecosystems is estimated to be high for the managed forests of this region. Future studies should strive to enhance our understanding of the hydrological connections between forests and streams on this landscape to determine the full effects of timber harvesting on the hydrology and biology of a watershed and its streams.

AB  - An increasing amount of research has focused on alternate methods to mitigate pesticide exposure in agricultural surface waters. The interception of spray-drift-derived azinphos-methyl (AZP) by emergent aquatic macrophytes was investigated in a tributary of the Lourens River, South Africa. The stream was dominated (80% coverage) by three species of emergent aquatic macrophytes; Juncus capensis, Fuirena hirsuta and Pycreus sp. During an application of AZP, drift deposition was determined on the surface of the vegetation, on the surface of the exposed channel of the stream and beneath J. capensis and F. hirsuta by means of drift collectors (n = 6). Drift deposition on the surface of the vegetation (1.5 +/- 0.3 mg/m2) was well predicted by 90th percentile basic drift values (1.3 mg/m2), indicating that the sampling devices resulted in an accurate measurement of drift deposition. Drift deposition on the surface of the exposed channel (1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/m2) was lower than measured on the vegetation surface indicating a positive shielding effect by the emergent plants. Drift deposition beneath J. capensis was significantly lower (p = 0.005) than on the vegetation surface and the exposed channel (p = 0.048), indicating highly effective interception of AZP. A simple formula was generated to make predictions of drift deposition reductions based on different percentage macrophyte coverage. Predictions showed that 50% macrophyte coverage in combination with a 5 m buffer strip resulted in as large a reduction in drift deposition as the combination of a 10 m buffer strip with 0% macrophyte coverage. Results thus indicate that emergent aquatic vegetation may be as effective a mitigation strategy for reducing spray-drift induced pesticide input as increasing the width of the no spraying buffer zone.

AB  - Roads and road-building are among the most important environmental impacts on forests near urban areas, but their effects on ecosystem processes and species distributions remain poorly known. Termites are the primary decomposer organisms in tropical forests and their spatial distribution is strongly affected by vegetation and soil structure. We studied the impacts of road construction on termite community structure in an Amazonian forest fragment near Manaus, Brazil. One leading question was whether the fragment under study was large enough to maintain the termite species pool present in nearby continuous forests. We also asked how soil moisture and canopy openness varied with proximity to roads, and whether these changes were associated with changes in termite species richness and composition in the fragment. While the forest fragment had a termite composition very similar to that of continuous forests, roads caused important changes in soil moisture and canopy openness, especially when close to forest edges. At distances of up to 81m from roads, changes in soil moisture were significantly related to changes in termite species composition, but there was no correlation between canopy openness and species richness or composition. These results suggest that fragmentation caused by roads impacts termites in a different and less damaging manner than fragmentation caused by other kinds of degradation, and that even fragments bisected by roads can support very diverse communities and even undescribed taxa of termites. We conclude that a buffer zone should be established for conservation purposes in the reserves surrounded by roads.

AB  - The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops in the EU has raised questions concerning gene dispersal and co-existence with non-GM-farming. Quantitative estimates of the gene dispersal from fields with GM-crops to fields with conspecific non-GM-crops (conventional or organic) are therefore needed in order to suggest isolation distances and other management strategies to keep GM-pollination below acceptable threshold values. A meta-analysis of available gene-flow data for oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was performed. The probability distribution that seeds of non-GM-oilseed rape are fertilised by foreign pollen grains from a neighbouring field of GM-oilseed rape is modelled as functions of the width of the recipient (i.e. pollen receiving) field and the distance to the pollen donor fields. Furthermore, the significance of using a buffer zone (removal of a 1-5 m border of a recipient field parallel to the pollen donor field) to reduce GM-pollination of the crop, is quantified and discussed. The predicted median and 95% credibility level of the probability of foreign pollination is calculated as a function of the width of the recipient field and the buffer zone, as well as the distance between fields. Analysis of different management strategies shows that an increasing isolation distance is more effective to reduce GM-pollen dispersal than the use of a buffer zone, especially for small recipient fields. The analysis shows that increasing the width of a recipient oilseed rape field, relative to the pollen donor field, will have a large effect on reducing the average level of fertilisation by foreign pollen within the recipient field. The results indicate that a GM-pollination percentage <0.1% will be possible if the isolation distance exceeds 100 m and the width of the non-GM-field is larger than 200 m. If a threshold value of 0.3% is acceptable, an isolation distance of 50 m should be sufficient even for smaller fields. The use of a 5 m discarded buffer zone surrounding the non-GM-field is expected to reduce GM-pollination by about a third. The implications of the results for field management in conventional and organic farming are discussed.

AB  - Floristic studies of south‐eastern Mexico have not considered the ravine component of the landscape and, in this study, we demonstrate the potential of ravines as refuges for orchids. At elevations of 1442–2358 m in the buffer zone of the Tacaná Volcano Biosphere Reserve, in the region of Soconusco, south‐eastern Mexico, where 7.68% of the landscape has slopes > 45°, we registered 86 species of orchid from 35 genera, 14 (16.25%) of which were exclusive to ravines, 47 (54.6%) were exclusive to accessible surrounding areas and 25 (29%) colonized both types of habitat. The tropical mountain cloud forest (TMCF) ecosystem was distributed in the accessible areas surrounding the ravines and in some sites extended into the ravines themselves. Evergreen mountain scrub forest (EMSF), only found in the ravines, contributed eight species of orchid exclusive to this ecosystem. The elevation, orientation and slope of the ravines influenced species richness. The instability of the ‘soils’ on steep slopes and occasional landslides were negative environmental characteristics of the ravines, which, however, were mostly dependent on the management of surrounding areas, and epiphytes inhabiting ravines and the surrounding areas shared similar risks of whole‐tree and branch fall, wind and torrential rain. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 178, 283–297.

AB  - The P risk index system has been developed to identify agricultural fields vulnerable to P loss as a step toward protecting surface water. Because of their high Langmuir phosphorus adsorption maxima (P(max)), use of drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs) should be considered as a best management practice (BMP) to lower P risk index scores. This work discusses three WTR application methods that can be used to reduce P risk scores: (i) enhanced buffer strip, (ii) incorporation into a high soil test phosphorus (STP) soil, and (iii) co-blending with manure or biosolids. The relationship between WTR P(max) and reduction in P extractability and runoff P was investigated. In a simulated rainfall experiment, using a buffer strip enhanced with 20 Mg WTR ha(-1), runoff P was reduced by from 66.8 to 86.2% and reductions were related to the WTR P(max). When 25 g kg(-1) WTR was incorporated into a high STP soil of 315 mg kg(-1) determined using Mehlich-3 extraction, 0.01 M calcium chloride-extractable phosphorus (CaCl2-P) reductions ranged from 60.9 to 96.0% and were strongly (P < 0.01) related to WTR P(max). At a 100 g kg(-1) WTR addition, Mehlich 3-extractable P reductions ranged from 41.1 to 86.7% and were strongly (P < 0.01) related to WTR P(max). Co-blending WTR at 250 g kg(-1) to manure or biosolids reduced CaCl2-P by >75%. The WTR P(max) normalized across WTR application rates (P(max) x WTR application) was significantly related to reductions in CaCl2-P or STP. Using WTR as a P risk index modifying factor will promote effective use of WTR as a BMP to reduce P loss from agricultural land.

AB  - We studied the effect of different ways to establish and to maintain unfertilised field margins on the development of potential weeds and seed dispersal into adjacent crops. Plant communities in field margins either developed spontaneously or were sown with different seed mixtures of grasses and forbs. Margins were mown twice a year and the cuttings were either removed or left in situ. Three years after establishment, the importance of the unsown rhizomatous species Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica was significantly higher in the unsown community or when cuttings were not removed after mowing. Seed dispersal from the margin into adjacent crops was important in the unsown community during the first year after establishment. Between 82% and 99% of the seeds were disseminated within 4 m from the margin strip. Overall risk of contaminating the adjacent crop with weeds originating from the field margin strip was concentrated within a few metres of the crop edge. In order to minimise the dissemination of weed species and invasion by noxious vegetatively propagated weeds on nutrient-rich land, it is recommended that field margins are established by sowing and cuttings removed after each cut.

AB  - The maintenance of fallows has been shown to prevent the loss of farmland biodiversity caused by agricultural intensification. These are mainly introduced as part of both obligatory and voluntary set-aside schemes. However, the obligatory set-aside has recently been abolished by the Common Agricultural Policy Health Check. In this study, we examine the role of fallow in fine-grained habitat use by a threatened farmland bird (Lesser Kestrel) during summer in northwestern Spain. To analyze Lesser Kestrel occurrence, we used generalized linear models, a theoretic-information approach and a hierarchical partitioning analysis. The best AIC-based models explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrels showed that fallow was the more important habitat type followed, to a lesser extent, by dry cereal stubble and field margin. In contrast, irrigated crops negatively influenced occurrence. Heterogeneity of crop mosaic was not important in explaining occurrence of Lesser Kestrel. Fallows, like dry cereal stubbles and field margins, seem to be suitable for foraging given the abundance of high food resources and their availability due to shorter vegetation cover. The abolition of the obligatory set-aside could reduce the total surface of fallow land (approximately 40.9%), likely affecting habitat use by Lesser Kestrel through an increase of other non-preferred crops (e.g., irrigated crops) or by decreasing food resources. Agri-environment schemes focusing on the maintenance of low-intensive farming systems with a mosaic of crops and semi-natural habitats interspersed should be promoted in premigratory areas to maintain Lesser Kestrel.

AB  - The boll weevil Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the most important cotton pest in Brazil. A large-scale field-testing of a Boll Weevil Suppression Program (BWSP) was implemented to assess its technical and operational feasibility for boll weevil suppression in the state of Goiás, Brazil. The pilot plan focused on 3,608 ha of cotton during the 2006/2007 and 6,011 ha in the 2007/2008 growing seasons; the areas were divided into four inner zones with an outer buffer zone. We analyzed data on boll weevil captures using pheromone traps installed in the BWSP fields, on the detection of the first insect and the first damaged floral bud, greatest damage, and number of insecticide applications. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was used to evaluate the differences between presuppression and suppression years. Fourteen pheromone-baited trapping evaluations were used to compare the weevil populations from 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 growing seasons. The BWSP regime reduced in-season boll weevil captures from 15- to 500-fold compared to presuppression levels in the preceding year. The low capture rates were related to delays in infestation and damage by weevils. The smaller population size measured by trapping and field monitoring reduced the number of required insecticide treatments. The BWSP strategy was efficient in suppressing populations of this pest and is a viable program for cotton production in subtropical and tropical regions, with long-term economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - This paper surveys the state of   knowledge about the trade-related environmental consequences   of a country's development strategy along three   channels: (i) direct trade-environment linkages   (overexploitation of natural resources and trade-related   transport costs); (ii) 'virtual trade' in   emissions resulting from production activities; and (iii)   the product mix attributes of a 'green-growth'   strategy (environmentally preferable products and goods for   environmental management). Trade exacerbates   over-exploitation of natural resources in weak institutional   environments, but there is little evidence that differences   in environmental policies across countries has led to   significant 'pollution havens.' Trade policies to   'level the playing field' would be ineffective and   result in destructive conflicts in the World Trade   Organization. Lack of progress at the Doha Round suggests   the need to modify the current system of global policy making.

AB  - In the Dutch Field Margin Project in the Haarlemmermeerpolder (1990-1994) a management strategy is being developed for promoting nature conservation on arable land and reducing pesticide drift to non-target areas. To this end, 3 and 6 m wide strips along the edges of winter wheat, sugar beet and potato crops have been left unsprayed with herbicides or insecticides and compared with sprayed edges. The effects on weeds, invertebrates, vertebrates, pesticide drift and costs to the farmer are being studied. This article reviews the results obtained to date. In the unsprayed edges weed cover increased substantially, as did the overall number of weed species. The impact on soil invertebrates such as carabids (activity density) was relatively minor. However, there was a pronounced effect on insects living on plants. Butterflies were 3-4 times more abundant in unsprayed winter wheat edges than in sprayed edges. The number of visits by Motacilla flava flava (Blue-headed wagtail), an insectivorous bird, was also 3-4 times higher. Interviews with farmers indicated that field margins were sprayed intensively. Drift measurements using water-sensitive paper demonstrated that pesticide deposition in adjacent ditches was less than 0.1 percent of the deposition in the target area for knapsack sprayers and max. 2.2 percent for field sprayers at low wind speed (3 m/s). At higher wind speed (5 m/s) these figures are 3.2 percent and about 7 percent respectively. The creation of unsprayed buffer zones of 3 m wide proves to be a very effective way of reducing pesticide drift to the ditch (by about 90 percent). Compared with sprayed edges, the average yield loss in unsprayed edges 3 m wide was 2 percent in potatoes, 13 percent in winter wheat and 30 percent in sugar beet. Cost-benefit analysis shows that in winter wheat and potatoes unsprayed crop edges can well be adopted in agricultural practice. In sugar beet, however, the cost is too high.

AB  - The tree structure and regeneration was studied in the buffer zone area comprising lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the Namdapha National Park, one of the largest remaining tract of pristine rainforests in the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot in India. The investigations were conducted in the three forest stands, viz. Altingia-mixed species, Shorea-Dipterocarp, and Albizia forests that are most dominant forest types in the lowland areas of the park. A total of 98, 54 and 20 species have been recorded at tree stratrum, while 87, 44 and 15 species at regeneration stratum for three stands, respectively. The cumulative regenerating density (seedlings+saplings) was estimated 17,648, 16,110 and 768 individual ha⁻¹ for respective stands. It was interesting to note that of the total regenerating species, 44-47% species were new to different stands, which mainly comprised middle storey species. Low-dominant and rare species also contributed significantly in the regeneration of the forest stands. The expanding population structure of forest stands indicated higher survival of the mid- and the low-canopy species than the top-canopy species. The data revealed that the future composition of these stands will highly depended on the potential regenerative status of species in each of the stand and such information would be crucial for forest management. Since the park contributed significantly to the regional biodiversity by depicting species assemblages for both wet evergreen and semi-evergreen biomes, such last remnants of rainforest should be integrally protected from anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Les zones tampons boisées peuvent épurer les flux latéraux d'eau en provenance des parcelles agricoles. Elles sont une solution efficace et complémentaire des modifications des pratiques culturales contre la pollution par les nitrates. La dénitrification microbienne anaérobie principalement et l'absorption par la végétation en croissance réalisent l'épuration. Ces deux processus sont complémentaires et durables puisqu'il n'y a pas de stockage de nitrates pouvant saturer les capacités d'épuration. Les conditions d'efficacité des zones tampons sont présentées : des arbres en croissance dans un site choisi en fonction de l'hydrologie locale et du sol permettent d'avoir une épuration très efficace avec de petites surfaces. Les zones tampons peuvent agir contre d'autres problèmes agricoles comme l'érosion ou la pollution par les sédiments et le phosphore. Cependant cette action est souvent temporaire du fait d'une saturation des capacités de stockage. Néanmoins, elle peut influer sur l'efficacité épuratrice contre les nitrates. Les zones tampons doivent s'intégrer dans un plan d'aménagement global, à l'échelle d'un petit bassin versant, le plus en amont possible. Pour bien proportionner le système d'épuration en fonction des besoins effectifs, sans utilisation excessive de terres de valeur, il faut établir un diagnostic des pollutions, de plus en plus souvent avec l'aide de Systèmes d'Information Géographique. Plusieurs solutions techniques adaptées aux contraintes de l'agriculture moderne sont proposées pour la réalisation concrète d'unité d'épuration, à un coût apparemment très avantageux pour la société.

AB  - Grass swales and filter strips are among the simplest and most cost-effective form of stormwater control measures. Despite this, relatively few controlled studies have been undertaken to assess their performance, and very few models are available to predict their efficiency. This paper focuses on field performance of grass filters in removal of total suspended solids (TSS) from overland flow, and verification of TRAVA, a model of sediment behaviour in grass filters (published earlier in Deletic, A., 2001. Modelling of water and sediment transport over grassed areas. Journal of Hydrology 248, 168-182; Deletic, A., 2005. Sediment behaviour in runoff over grassed surfaces. Journal of Hydrology 301, 108-122). Limited nutrient removal data were collected, at one of the field sites. The paper presents results from controlled field tests undertaken on a grass filter strip in Aberdeen, Scotland, and a grass swale in Brisbane, Australia. In both studies TSS concentrations were recorded along the grass, for artificial inflow of water and sediment of different flow rates and sediment concentrations. In the Aberdeen study the emphasis was on performance in relation to different sediment particle sizes, while for the Brisbane swale, treatment performance for total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were also recorded. Both experimental programmes had an unsteady input of pollutants. The Aberdeen strip reduced sediment inflow concentrations by 61-86%, whilst the Brisbane swale removed an average of 69, 46, and 56% of the total loads of TSS, TP and TN, respectively. TRAVA was used to model both the strip and swale. For the Aberdeen strip, the differences between the measured and modelled sediment loading rates were within +/-25% of measured. Modelled concentrations in outflow from the Brisbane swale were within +/-17% of measured. The predicted mass of total sediment removed during experiments was within +/-50% of measured for the Aberdeen strip and +/-11% for the Brisbane swale. TRAVA is therefore shown to be a reliable tool for prediction of the performance of grass filters used for stormwater treatment.

AB  - Root turnover is a relevant process controlling carbon and nutrient cycles. Furthermore, root biomass could influence the effectiveness of riparian buffer systems with regard to immobilizing and processing soil water pollutants and improving soil quality. However, sampling root biomass presents many technical problems, because there is as yet no well-established method for assessment thereof. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of limited sampling depth on biomass assessment in four riparian buffers and on two different dates (January and June): a poplar forest, two mixed deciduous afforestations of different ages, and a grassy area. Although, for all systems, most root biomass was limited to the first 30 cm, detection of differences in root biomass among vegetation types depended strongly on sampling depth for both sampling dates. Furthermore, although the poplar forest presented one of the most stable root systems in terms of total biomass between the sampling dates, it was one of the most seasonally dynamic in terms of the amount and distribution with depth of root biomass. The results of this study suggest that a minimum sampling depth should be established for each study according to seasonal variation in vertical distribution of root biomass.

AB  - Les bandes herbeuses sont un moyen efficace pour protéger les eaux de surface de contaminations éventuelles par les engrais et les produits de traitement transportés par les eaux de ruissellement. Une partie de ces eaux est piégée par infiltration dans la bande herbeuse. L'objectif de l'étude est de suivre le devenir et d'évaluer le lessivage de l'atrazine et de la dééthylatrazine (DEA) transportées dans les eaux de ruissellement et piégées dans une bande herbeuse installée en bas d'une parcelle en pente cultivée en maïs. La solution du sol est échantillonnée à deux profondeurs à l'aide de bougies poreuses, le lessivage des produits est estimé à partir du drainage calculé par un modèle de bilan hydrique au champ. Les résultats montrent que l'atrazine et la DEA transportées par les eaux de ruissellement migrent dans la bande herbeuse par des transferts préférentiels à une profondeur d'au moins 60 cm en 1997 et 1999 sans parvenir à 120 cm. En 1998, la descente des pesticides n'atteint pas 60 cm. La profondeur de migration dépend de l'état hydrique du sol au moment des événements pluvieux. La persistance de la DEA dans l'eau du sol est plus longue que celle de l'atrazine, ces produits se dissipent plus lentement en profondeur. L'atténuation des concentrations en atrazine à 60 cm de profondeur par rapport à celles des eaux de ruissellement varie de 60 à 95 /, selon les années et la place de la bougie poreuse par rapport aux voies d'écoulement. Les transferts sont limités aux quelques semaines qui suivent les traitements alors que le lessivage de la DEA et de l'atrazine intervient principalement pendant la période d'arrêt de la végétation. Dans les conditions climatiques de cette étude, le lessivage calculé de la DEA est deux fois celui de l'atrazine

AB  - Vegetative filter strip (VFS) is a main kind of Best Management Practices for the control of non-point source pollution. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of VFS in Chinese northwest regions. Three VFSs with natural grass and Hippophae rhamnoides/grass patterns have been constructed in the bank slope of Xiaohuashan reservoir, Huaxian County, Shannxi Province. The removal effects of VFS and influencing factors have been analyzed based on field experiment data. The result reveals a positive effect on reducing the transportation of suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen in surface runoff, and it is more efficient on suspended solids removal. The experiment also shows that most of the suspended particles and pollutants bound to them were entrapped in the first 10 m of VFS. The main factors influencing effectiveness of VFS include vegetation patterns and inflow rate. In addition, inflow pollutant concentration has a larger impact on reducing total nitrogen and total phosphorus by VFS, but the reduction effect on SS has no significant difference.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in three adjacent riparian sites (mixed vegetation, forest and grass). The highest DEA was found in the surface (0-30 cm) soil and varied between 0.7±0.1 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 5°C and 5.9±0.4 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 15°C. There was no significant difference (P >0.05) between the DEA in the uppermost (0-30 cm and 60-90 cm) soil depths under different vegetation covers. In the two deepest (120-150 cm and 180-210 cm) soil depths the DEA varied between 0.0±0.0 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 5°C and 4.4±0.9 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 15°C and was clearly associated with the accumulation of buried organic carbon (OC). Two threshold values of OC were observed before DEA started to increase significantly, namely 5 and 25 g OC kg-1 soil at 10-15°C and 5°C, respectively. In the three riparian sites N2O fluxes varied between a net N2O uptake of -0.6±0.4 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 and a net N2O emission of 2.5±0.3 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1. The observed N2O emission did not lead to an important pollution swapping (from water pollution to greenhouse gas emission). Especially in the mixed vegetation and forest riparian site highest N2O fluxes were observed upslope of the riparian site. The N2O fluxes showed no clear temporal trend.

AB  - This study analyzes the change in whole-farm net revenues and nutrient reduction from the implementation of five best management practices (BMPs) on a typical beef and beef-poultry farm in Shenandoah County. Whole-farm net revenues, resource allocation, nutrient loss reductions, and the cost efficiency of reducing nutrient losses were analyzed to assess which BMPs are the most cost efficient to implement, assuming the baseline scenarios have no voluntarily applied BMPs. The effects of stacking additional BMPs, in combinations of two or more, were also assessed. No-till cropping, winter wheat cover crop, herbaceous riparian buffer, fencing, and P-based NMP were the BMPs that were analyzed. Incentive payments from state and federal governments were incorporated into the cost of BMP adoption. A brief analysis of a farmerâs time value of money, with respect to incentive payments, was also conducted. Results indicated that no-till crop management was the most cost efficient BMP, and was the only BMP to increase net revenues for both farm models. Fencing and P-based NMP were the least cost efficient for the beef farm. For the beef-poultry farm, fencing was the least cost efficient.The implications of this study are that farmers that choose to adopt BMP should evaluate both their interests in maintaining (or increasing) farm net revenues along with their interest in improving water quality through the reduction of nutrient losses. There is potential for implementing multiple BMPs, while increasing net revenues from a farmâs baseline scenario. For farmers and policy makers, no-till cropping can be a profitable and therefore cost efficient BMP to implement. Incentive payments are intended to encourage the adoption of BMPs by subsidizing a portion of the start-up costs. Policy makers should attempt to make cost-share payments reflect nutrient reduction goals. This can be done by analyzing both the compliance cost to farmers and the nutrient reduction effectiveness of BMPs.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay is a major water resource whose quality has been threatened by soilerosion and agrichemical contamination. The control of agricultural pollution of the Bay is one of thefocal points of the 1987 Chesapeake Bay agreement formed by four states in the Bay's watershed(Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia). Among the suggested solutions isthe promotion of low-input agricultural practices. However, some low-input practices also includefrequent cultivations of the soil for non-chemical weed control practices, which may induce erosion.This analysis uses a case study approach to determine agricultural practice selection andpotential erosion under different soil erosion constraints. A multi-period mathematical programmingmodel was used to determine the preferred agricultural practices for a fanner maximizing net returnsin Richmond County, Virginia. Richmond County is adjacent to the Rappahanock River and abovethe Columbia aquifer, major sources of fresh water for the Chesapeake Bay. A range of agriculturalpractices was available, including conventional and organic practices. Soil erosion and the level ofchemical and nitrogen losses through sedimentation and leaching are discussed in this article. Soilerosion constraints were introduced that reduced erosion by 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 percent fromcurrent levels. These constraints were met without idled cropland, besides that enrolled in theConservation Reserve Program or Virginia's mandatory Buffer Strip Program. The results of this studyillustrate that soil conservation policies and low-input practices produce few environmental tradeoffsbetween erosion control and the reduction of agrichemical pollution.

AB  - Since 1974 Foot and Mouth-Disease (FMD) has been considered as a sporadic disease in Greece. On June 20th 1984 FMD type ASIA 1 appeared in European continent (Delta, Evros, Greece) for the first time. This was the last incident of FMD in Greece. Cattle of two herds consisting of 285 and 650 animals respectively showed vigorous clinical symptoms of FMD. On the same day pathological material arrived at the FMD-Institute in Athens. Suspension (10%) of this material is inoculated in suitable cells (BRS 2) and in 2-4 days old mice. Simultaneously the material is examined by CFT against the hyperimmunsera A5, A22, A kars, Opeplo, Ogb, Cdet, Asia 1, SAT 1, 2, 3 provided by Pirbright. At 1.30 a.m. of the same day FMD type ASIA 1 is diagnosed definitely (ASIA 1/Greece 1/84). The same type of virus is isolated from sample of the same pathological material examined at Pirbright serological comparison proved that the ASIA 1/Greece 1/84 is very closely related to ASIA 1 Leb 3/83 and less related to Inde 8/79, lnde 34/81 and kampuchea 9/80. A total of 1281 cattle and 11 pigs are killed and 124 Mil. Dr. are paid. The animals of this area and of the buffer zone are vaccinated with 125,000 dosis of type ASIA 1 vaccine provided by FAO. Epizootiological evidence are given and suggestion are made. Epizootiological research proves that the disease was transmitted from Turkey. Thanks to immediate diagnosis the disease has been limited only in the two original outbreaks.

AB  - Results of a field survey of southern Wisconsin shallow lakes suggested that watershed (catchment basin) land use has a significant and adverse effect on zooplankton species richness. Zooplankton communities in lakes with no riparian buffer zone, in agriculture-dominated watersheds, contained about half as many species as lakes in least-impact watersheds. In that study, the age of the lake was not taken into account. It is possible that agricultural lakes, often artificial, were so recently-constructed that they had not yet accumulated the equilibrium number of species characteristic of older lakes. In other words, it is possible that the interpretation of the results of the previous study is fatally flawed, if the results were an artifact of lake age, rather than an effect of land use. The major aim of this current study was to determine the ages of agricultural lakes and of lakes in least-impact watersheds, to test for an effect of lake age on zooplankton species richness, using the same sites from the previous study. We used an anova approach to test the null hypothesis that two factors, watershed land use and lake age, had no systematic effect on zooplankton species richness. We determined the age of 35 shallow lakes, using aerial photos, satellite images, and interviews of resource managers and land owners. We identified five artificial agricultural sites and five artificial sites in least-impact prairie watersheds. The artificial sites in this study ranged from 3 to 37 years in age, while natural lakes dated from the melting of the last glacier, about 9500 years ago. Our results suggest, that because artificial lake made up only about a third of the sites, and for the range of lake age and watershed land use, lake age did not have a significant effect on zooplankton species richness, while land use had a highly significant adverse effect. These results pose a larger question for future research. Namely, how quickly do newly-constructed lakes attain the equilibrium number of species seen in the previous study, and what is the quantitative relationship between lake age and zooplankton richness?

AB  - Results of a field survey of southern Wisconsin shallow lakes suggested that watershed (catchment basin) land use has a significant and adverse effect on zooplankton species richness. Zooplankton communities in lakes with no riparian buffer zone, in agriculture-dominated watersheds, contained about half as many species as lakes in least-impact watersheds. In that study, the age of the lake was not taken into account. It is possible that agricultural lakes, often artificial, were so recently-constructed that they had not yet accumulated the equilibrium number of species characteristic of older lakes. In other words, it is possible that the interpretation of the results of the previous study is fatally flawed, if the results were an artifact of lake age, rather than an effect of land use. The major aim of this current study was to determine the ages of agricultural lakes and of lakes in least-impact watersheds, to test for an effect of lake age on zooplankton species richness, using the same sites from the previous study.

AB  - This text focuses on the identification, efficiencies, classification and management of landscape features having a potential buffer function regarding diffuse phosphorus, because of their specific structure (vegetation-soil) and of their location at the interface between sources (farm infrastructures, emitting fields…) and surface water bodies. These buffers are very diverse and correspond to natural landscape features (wetlands, riparian areas…) as well as manmade structures (constructed buffer strips or intermediate cases such as field margins, hedgerows). Their role and efficiency depends on the local factors controlling the retention processes (internal organisation and properties of the buffer), on the position within the watershed, and on the landscape context which reciprocally determines the overall buffer capacity of a watershed. On that basis, we recognize the diversity of the buffers in structure and functioning and thus in the way they attenuate the signal, their limitations (sustainability, side effects) and their hierarchic organisation at the watershed scale.

AB  - In order to protect water and other sensitive areas from spray drift, and make the best use of mitigation measures, an evaluation of drift risk should be made prior to a spray application. The objective of this work was to develop a practical, interactive tool to evaluate the risk of spray drift for specific weather and field situation, and propose effective measures to mitigate this risk. This should help the pesticide user to make better decisions in order to reduce potential spray drift contamination. The Drift Evaluation Tool (DET) is intended to be used by the pesticide users and advisors, and hence raise their awareness on the effect of factors influencing spray drift and on mitigation measures to reduce drift risk. The aim was to offer a simple and practical application software that would be user-friendly and educative to encourage its wide use. The operator communicates with the software via its simple and intuitive visual interface. He is guided through three pages and asked to select in the proposed lists of options the parameters that best reflect his actual situation. On the first page the user determines the application site: within or beyond the zone of awareness (buffer zone plus boom width), i.e. whether or not risk of drift need to be considered. On the next page he determines actual weather and field conditions: wind direction and velocity, air temperature and humidity, crop height and adjacent structures. Once the items are selected the Drift Risk Value SITUATION (%) (DRVS) is calculated and expressed both in figure and graphically. Thus, the user can see directly how variations in weather and field conditions may affect the spray drift risk. Depending on the risk level appropriate practical recommendation appears on the screen. On the last page the user simulates mitigation measures by selecting different application techniques and application parameters. He may select spray drift reduction class of the simulated technique, boom height and driving velocity. For each selection a Drift Risk Value – APPLICATION (%) (DRVA) is calculated to show the effect of the selected risk mitigation measures. The final recommendation is given to the user based on the determined risk level. The algorithm of calculation of drift risk values for the selected items is based on available results of drift studies, and where information was missing, especially on interactions between factors, an expert judgment was used in the algorithm.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to assess the effectiveness of two grass covers (buffer zone and grass-covered inter-row), to reduce pesticide leaching, and subsequently to preserve groundwater quality. Lower amounts of pesticides leached through grass-cover soil columns (2.7-24.3% of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8.0-55.1%), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8.9-32.2%) than tebuconazole (2.7-12.9%), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient similar to that of diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10.2-55.1%), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides. The results of diuron and tebuconazole transfer through undisturbed buffer zone soil columns are in agreement with field observations on the buffer zone.

L’utilisation du gène de résistance Vat, contre le principal puceron ravageur Aphis gossypii et les virus qu’il transmet, est intéressante mais il existe un fort risque de contournement. Afin de diminuer ce risque, le gène Vat est couplé à une autre méthode de lutte : l’aménagement de l’environnement parcellaire. La mise en place de bandes fleuries et enherbées pourrait augmenter l’efficacité et la durabilité de la résistance génétique. De plus, la compréhension des liens qui unissent les pucerons et les virus devrait faciliter la mise en place de méthodes de lutte. Des captures journalières de pucerons ailés sont effectuées grâce à un piège à aspiration et la détection de la présence des virus sur le melon se fait toutes les semaines par test ELISA. Les données des essais menés sur trois années ne montrent pas d’effet significatif de l’aménagement parcellaire sur les populations de pucerons ailés. Le couplage des deux méthodes tend à retarder et ralentir les épidémies de CABYV. Le croisement des données sur les pucerons et les virus a permis d’établir une relation prédictive entre le cumul de pucerons A.gossypii pendant les deux premières semaines post plantation et l’épidémie de CABYV.

AB  - In response to the rapid destruction of mangrove forestry for shrimp culture during 1980-1995 in Ca Mau Province of Vietnam, several policies and regulations have been issued and implemented by the Vietnamese government to reforest and protect the mangroves. The integrated mangrove-shrimp farming system which is carried out in the buffer zone of CA National Park (Decision No. 64/QD-UB), was promoted by the government to ensure both mangrove conservation and income generation. The system was designed based on area but this resulted to several technical and socio-economic problems such as mangrove destruction and human migration. This study was designed to assess the status of mangrove-shrimp farming system with different scales of mangrove area and shrimp pond area (Type 1 less than 3 ha:60 percent mangrove, 40 percent shrimp pond; and Type 2 greater than 3 ha:70 percent mangrove 30 percent shrimp pond). Household data were obtained through a random survey and water quality data were measured at the shrimp ponds. There were no significant differences in socio-demographic characteristics such as educational attainment, household size, age, and farming experience between the two types of farming system. Household size, highest education attainment, farming experience, age of respondents had no relationship with farm production and profitability, pH, salinity, temperature, EC, TSS, DO, COD, NH4+ of water did not significantly vary among the two farming systems. However, these factors had no relationship to shrimp yields. The mangrove forest area had no correlation with shrimp production. There were significant differences between the average density stocking and the stocking frequency of the two farming systems (P less than 0.05). The average productivity of Type 1 and Type 2 was 314.12 plus or minus 42.161 kg/ha/yr and 263.56 plus or minus 38.255 kg/ha/yr. Shrimp stocking frequency cost of production were positively correlated with shrimp production. The density of shrimp per month was negatively correlated with shrimp production (R2=0.563). The cost of production of Type 1 was higher than those of Type 2 farming while the average net profit per hectare of Type 1 was lower than those of Type 2 farming. There was significant difference about average net profit between the two types of farming systems (P less than 0.05). The implications of the integrated mangrove-shrimp farming system on its sustainability are discussed and appropriate recommendations are suggested.

AB  - Leaf litter plays a critical role in regulating ecological functions in headwater forest streams, whereas the effects of leaves on water quality in urbanized streams are not fully understood. This study examined the potential importance of leaf litter for the release and transformations of organic carbon and nutrients in urban streams, and compared the effects with other types of natural organic substrates (periphyton and stream sediment). Nutrients and organic carbon were leached from senescent leaves of 6 tree species in the laboratory with deionized water, and maximal releases, leaching rate constants, composition and bioavailability of the leached dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined. Stream substrates (leaf debris, rocks with periphyton, and sediment) were seasonally collected from urban and forest reference streams of the NSF Baltimore Long-term Ecological Research Site and incubated with overlying stream water to estimate areal fluxes of DOC and nitrogen. Leaf litter leaching showed large ranges in maximal releases of DOC (7.0–131� mg� g⁻¹), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON; 0.07–1.39� mg� g⁻¹) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP; 0.14–0.70� mg� g⁻¹) among tree species. DOC leaching rate constants, carbon to nitrogen ratios, and DOC bioavailability were all correlated with organic matter quality indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Results from substrate incubation experiments showed far higher DOC and DON release and nitrate retention with leaf debris than with sediment, or rocks with periphyton. DOC release from leaf debris was positively correlated with stream nitrate retention at residential and urban sites, with the highest values observed during the fall and lowest during the summer. This study suggests the potential importance of leaf litter quantity and quality on fostering DOC and nutrient release and transformations in urban streams. It also suggests that species-specific impacts of leaves should be considered in riparian buffer and stream restoration strategies.

AB  - Vegetative buffer strips represent a possible approach for filtering the pollutants transported in runoff before the water reaches watercourses. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these filter strip systems is often low in the first year after establishment because of the limited vegetation cover. The goal of this project was to evaluate the initial effectiveness of an integrated grass/tree strip system in filtering runoff and drainage water from grain corn fields fertilized with liquid swine manure. The experimental site consisted of four random blocks each comprising three plots (i.e. treatments T1-T2-T3). The effectiveness of the grass treatment (T2) and the grass/poplar tree treatment (T3), compared with the control plot with no vegetative strip (T1), was determined for each water quality parameter (total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus, nitrogen, Escherichia coli) based on the total annual loads exported from the plots. The results obtained in the first year after the experimental layout was established in 2004 indicate that the grassed strips T2 reduced runoff water (R) volumes by 40%, TSS by 87%, total P by 86%, dissolved P by 64%, NH₄ by 57%, NO₃ by 33% and E. coli by 48% whereas the grass/tree strips T3 reduced runoff volumes by 35%, TSS by 85%, total P by 85%, dissolved P by 57%, NH₄ by 47%, NO₃ by 30% and E. coli by 57%. The drainage water (D) volumes measured for the plots containing vegetative strips (T2 and T3) increased by 16% and 8%, respectively, compared with the control plot (T1). The increased drainage water volume also corresponded to increased total P of 418%, dissolved P of 23% and E. coli of 24% for treatment T2; and increases of 347%, 27% and 18%, respectively, for treatment T3. By contrast, the NH₄ and NO₃ loads in drainage water were reduced by 8% and 63% in T2 and by 11% and 68% in T3. Overall, taking into account the total loads exported in runoff and drainage water (R + D), the vegetative filter strips system T2-T3 reduced water volumes by about 15%, TSS by 85%, total P by 75%, dissolved P by 30%, NH₄ by 50%, NO₃ by 60% and E. coli by 25% in agricultural non-point source pollution associated with liquid swine manure spread in the corn plots. The addition of young (two-years-old) poplars in treatment T3 did not bring about a significant increase in the filtering capacity of the grassed strip system in this first year of monitoring.

AB  - A riparian buffer installed along streams is one alternative that can be used to reduce the delivery of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment to the stream. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) has been developed to simulate surface and subsurface riparian buffer hydrology, sediment transport, litter and sediment interactions, vegetation growth, and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics. For this model to accurately simulate transport and fate of nutrients in the shallow groundwater beneath a riparian buffer, the subsurface hydrology component must be verified. Two years of field data were utilized to evaluate and test the sensitivity of the hydrology component of REMM in the North Carolina Middle Coastal Plain. Daily simulated water table depth was compared to observed water table depths across a 15 m wide buffer. The simulated water table depth was sensitive to hydrologic parameters such as groundwater inputs from the upland into zone 3, stream depth, and buffer slope. Average absolute errors between simulated and observed water table depth were found to be 0.35 to 0.36 m, while relative errors ranged from 0.12 to 0.15 m. Simulated evapotranspiration (ET) was higher in zone 3 compared to zones 1 and 2, although all three zones were parameterized alike. Flow into the buffer from the stream is not simulated by REMM, although it occurred frequently during data collection. Estimates of ET should be improved for herbaceous and grass vegetation types to improve water table depth predictions. Also, for conditions where the stream contributes flow to the groundwater, an additional component in REMM is necessary.

AB  - To minimize the risk posed by runoff from row crops, Prince Edward Island introduced buffer legislation in 2000. The legislation mandates 10-m and 20-m buffers, respectively, for moderate sloped (i.e. <5%) and steep sloped (i.e. >5%) agricultural fields that border streams. Since 2001, Environment Canada has been evaluating the effectiveness of various buffer widths on operational farms in reducing toxicity and contaminant concentrations in runoff. Sample collectors, placed in 44 fields at the field edge (0m), 10m and at distances out to 30m, collected overland flow following rainfall-induced runoff events. Samples were collected within 24 hours of an event and analysed for seven pesticides (endosulfan, chlorothalonil, carbofuran, linuron, metribuzin, metalaxyl, mancozeb), water quality parameters and Daphnia magna toxicity. The 10-m buffer required for moderate sloped fields was effective at reducing contaminant concentrations but not always to less than lethal concentrations to Daphnia magna. Limited data beyond 10m for fields of both slope types precluded making recommendations on a suitable buffer width for shallow sloped fields and evaluating the effectiveness of 20-m buffers for steep sloped fields. When paired data were combined and statistically tested for all fields, the studied pesticides underwent a 52-98% and 68-100% reduction in aqueous and particulate concentrations within 10m and 30m, respectively. In addition, by 10m, soluble phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids were reduced by 34%, 38% and 64%, respectively. Results suggest buffer zones on operational farms are capable of achieving contaminant reductions comparable to those reported for controlled experiments. Inconsistent siting of sample collectors beyond 10m limited the evaluation of the effects of field slope and buffer width on buffer effectiveness on working farms. Future studies on buffer efficiency on operational farms should focus on building the data set beyond 10m and evaluating load reductions.

AB  - The studies reviewed in this paper   indicate that with adequate preparedness planning and   execution it is possible to contain pandemic influenza   outbreaks where they occur, for viral strains of moderate   infectiousness. For viral strains of higher infectiousness,   containment may be difficult, but it may be possible to   mitigate the effects of the spread of pandemic influenza   within a country and/or internationally with a combination   of policies suited to the origins and nature of the initial   outbreak. These results indicate the likelihood of   containment success in 'frontline risk' countries,   given specific resource availability and level of   infectiousness; as well as mitigation success in   'secondary' risk countries, given the assumption   of inevitable international transmission through air travel   networks. However, from the analysis of the modeling results   on interventions in the U.S. and U.K. after a global   pandemic starts, there is a basis for arguing that the   emphasis in the secondary risk countries could shift from   mitigation towards containment. This follows since a   mitigation-focused strategy in such developed countries   presupposes that initial outbreak containment in these   countries will necessarily fail. This is paradoxical if   containment success at similar infectiousness of the virus   is likely in developing countries with lower public health   resources, based on results using similar modeling   methodologies. Such a shift in emphasis could have major   implications for global risk management for diseases of   international concern such as pandemic influenza or a   SARS-like disease.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are a low-cost management option that have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing runoff transport offer fertilizer constituents applied to grassed areas (pasture or meadow). Runoff quality studies involving fertilizers applied to grassed areas suggest that VFS can be designed by assuming that (1) only infiltration is responsible for pollutant removal, (2) the first post-application runoff event is most important from a water quality perspective (enabling a design event approach), and (3) no pollutant build-up that degrades VFS performance will occur. The purpose of this study was to develop a VFS design algorithm for grassed areas that uses available information on the water quality dynamics of these systems to simplify the design process to the greatest degree practical. The design algorithm consists of the SCS (1972) Curve Number method for runoff estimation and the Overcash et al. (1981) equation for predicting concentrations of pollutants exiting a VFS as a function of VFS and runoff parameters. The procedure can be used to determine the VFS length required to meet either an allowable pollutant runoff concentration or allowable pollutant mass transport. As an alternative, the process can be used to determine VFS length required to achieve given relative reductions in incoming pollutant runoff concentrations and mass transport. This algorithm can be used quickly and with minimal data to determine the VFS length requirement necessary to provide any desired degree of effectiveness given inputs such as incoming pollutant runoff concentration, background pollutant runoff concentration, soil hydrologic properties, and design storm parameters. Charts are presented that eliminate the need for computations in selected cases

AB  - Runoff from land areas amended with poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) manure can contain elevated concentrations of metals such as Cu, Fe, and Zn. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) can reduce runoff concentrations of animal manure components, but reported studies have typically focused on nutrients and solids rather than metals. This experiment assessed the impact of VFS length (0 to 12 m) on concentrations and mass losses of Cu, Fe, K, Na, Ni, and Zn in runoff from fescuegrass (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots (1.5 m wide X 6 and 12 m long) treated with poultry litter. The runoff was produced from simulated rainfall applied at 50 mm h-1 until 1 h of runoff had occurred. Runoff Ni concentrations were below detection levels in all cases. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, K, Na, and Zn did not differ between litter-treated plot lengths but were significantly (p 0.001) affected by VFS length, decreasing in an approximately first order fashion. Means separation indicated that concentrations of Cu, Fe, K, and Zn did not significantly decrease after a VFS length of 3 m, while Na concentrations decreased up to a VFS length of 6 m. Mass transport of only Cu significantly decreased with increasing VFS, suggesting that VFS removal mechanisms such as adsorption to clay particles might play a larger role with regard to Cu than to Fe, K, Na, and Zn

AB  -:  Painted terrapin or Callagur borneoensis is among Malaysia’s most endangered freshwater turtle species that was enlisted as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1990. In Malaysia, the biggest population of the species can be found in Sungai Setiu, Terengganu. The nesting behavior pattern of Painted terrapin was studied with focus on its relation to the sand particle size in the coastal beach where the terrapins lay their eggs. The findings showed that there was a correlation between distribution of sand particle size and nesting density of the Painted terrapin in this area. Horizontal analysis showed that as sand particle size gets larger further from the river mouth, the number of nest decreases (r2 = 0.85). Vertical analysis showed that as sand particle size gets larger further upward from the shoreline, the number of nest increases (r2 = 0.99). Painted terrapin showed preference to nest and lay their eggs at sand with smaller particle size. The straight-line equation of the analysis is y = 4.67x – 1.56 for horizontal analysis and y = 21.84x – 16.71 for vertical analysis. Average nest depth is 17.1 cm. Average nest incubation temperature is 29.2o C. Average nest distance from the shoreline is 28.9 m. Average nest distance  from the nearest vegetation is 15.4 m. Average size of terrapin eggs is 8.72 cm in length and 5.54 cm in maximum width. The findings suggested the required buffer zone that would be useful for PERHILITAN Department in order to set up a new policy on terrapin conservation and rehabilitation.

AB  - Riparian buffers along stream margins have been widely adopted as a management strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of plantation forestry on stream ecosystems.  However, the efficacy of these riparian buffers can be jeopardised by variations in width, length, and vegetation which can range from native and exotic scrub (including bracken, gorse, broom and blackberry) to remnant beech forest.  This thesis investigates the influence of riparian vegetation age and composition, on stream ecosystems within exotic pine plantations.  Initially, a survey of 50 streams within pine forests of various ages and riparian composition was conducted at sites from mid-Canterbury to Hanmer Springs over the summer of 2004-2005.  Additionally, terrestrial subsidies were compared between young pine, mature pine and indigenous forest streams to ascertain differences or similarities between vegetation types.  A range of physico-chemical and biological characteristics were recorded, while vegetative age and composition with catchment, riparian buffer and reach scales were determined using GIS.  Forestry activities were found to vary temporarily and tended to adversely impact upon streams where riparian buffers were narrow and lacked indigenous vegetation.  Stream instability and sedimentation were consistently higher in catchments lacking indigenous riparian vegetation, and more markedly so in recently harvested catchments compared with more mature forests.  Streams dominated by pine forests had finer substrates with higher water temperatures and levels of turbidity, while those dominated by indigenous forest had coarser substrates, higher flows and dissolved oxygen levels, and less in-stream debris.  Benthic community composition was similar among sites, although taxonomic richness, EPT diversity, and invertebrate abundances were enhanced by indigenous riparian vegetation.

AB  - The importance of the role of local community forestry institutions towards forest conservation is exemplified through a comparison of two adjacent areas within the Central Yucatan Peninsular Region (CYPR) in which Land-Use Cover Change (LUCC) analyses were conducted. We also used logistic regression analyses to examine key environmental, socioeconomic and institutional drivers associated with deforestation. One of the areas, La Montaña (LM) at Hopelchen, Campeche, is part of the northern section and buffer zone of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) as well as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. LM is an agricultural forest frontier region economically dependent on productive activities. The other study, Zona Maya (ZM), found at the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Quintana is characterized by having developed community-based forestry enterprises with world wide recognition. In addition, the major tourism industry in nearby Cancun and Riviera Maya provide an important source of off-farm labor and temporary migration. Results show contrasting annual deforestation rates among the two study areas, being greater in the Campeche site (0.7% from 2000 to 2005) compared to Quintana Roo (-0.002% from 2000 to 2004). Logistic regression results show that the occurrence of land clearing at LM is significantly related to demographic variables as well as soil-environment types and conservation status did not reveal to relate to LUCC processes at all. At Quintana Roo, despite twice the population density, population variables at large did not strongly correlate to forest clearing. Rather forest conservation or maintenance was shown to be influenced by local community forestry institutions and a landscape zoning provided by larger management goals from the part of the communities. Greater availability of wage labor for the prominent tourism economy may also reflect a lesser dependence on agriculture and contribute to the much lower deforestation rate. Nonetheless, results show that community forest management can play an effective role in forest conservation. We argue for a regional land use management approach as a conservation strategy in which local inhabitants are considered key actors.

AB  - Commercial rice, Oryza sativa L., fields in southeastern Texas were sampled during 2003 and 2004, and visual samples were compared with sweep net samples. Fields were sampled at different stages of panicle development, times of day, and by different operators. Significant differences were found between perimeter and within field sweep net samples, indicating that samples taken 9 m from the field margin overestimate within field Oebalus pugnax (F.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) populations. Time of day did not significantly affect the number of O. pugnax caught with the sweep net; however, there was a trend to capture more insects during morning than afternoon. For all sampling methods evaluated during this study, O. pugnax was found to have an aggregated spatial pattern at most densities. When comparing sweep net with visual sampling methods, one sweep of the “long stick” and two sweeps of the “sweep stick” correlated well with the sweep net (r2 = 0.639 and r2 = 0.815, respectively). This relationship was not affected by time of day of sampling, stage of panicle development, type of planting or operator. Relative cost-reliability, which incorporates probability of adoption, indicates the visual methods are more cost-reliable than the sweep net for sampling O. pugnax.

AB  - The herd reproductive ratio (Rh) and spatio-temporal clustering were estimated in the 2004 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Peru. The epidemic lasted 39 days and involved 26 herds. Movement of cattle was restricted, all susceptible species within a 25-km buffer zone were revaccinated, and infected animals with clinical signs of FMD were killed or destroyed to control and eradicate the disease. The Rh declined from 5.3 on the second day of the epidemic to 1.31 on the 25th day. Spatio-temporal clustering of cases was detected at a critical distance of 0.5 km and critical times of 7 and 14 days. Cases were clustered in space (P = 0.006) but not in time (P = 0.498). The space-time scan method detected a spatio-temporal cluster that included consecutive case numbers 13, 14 and 15, located at the temporal midpoint of the epidemic. The values estimated for Rh and the cluster analyses provide quantitative estimates of the self-limiting nature of FMD spread in a susceptible but vaccinated population.

AB  - To investigate potential changes in soil microbial characteristics of riparian zones subject to chronic nitrogen influx, we conducted an N-addition experiment in a riparian forest in the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA. During 6 months, we quantified temporal changes in denitrification and respiration rates, microbial biomass, and bacterial and fungal activity, following single and repeated inorganic N additions to the near-stream zone ('zone 1') and the upslope area ('zone 2') within the riparian site. Zone 1 soil had significantly higher soil moisture, larger labile and microbial C and N pools, higher denitrification, bacterial and fungal respiration rates, and a lower pH than zone 2 soil. Over time, all added N was effectively removed from zone 1 soil by denitrification, regardless of whether N was added in a single large pulse or multiple small pulses. In contrast, added N did not significantly stimulate denitrification in zone 2 soil, which lacked sufficient anaerobicity and had lower labile C levels. In neither zone did N addition result in net N immobilization into microbial biomass, suggesting that microbial storage is not a major N-removal mechanism in this riparian forest. In both zones N additions slightly reduced microbial C and basal respiration, and increased fungal activity. Although bacterial activity was not significantly affected, the observation of increased bacterivorous nematode populations in N-amended soils suggests that bacterial production had been temporarily stimulated by N addition. However, it may be expected that long-term effects of chronic N influx mostly negatively affect microbial biomass and activity, which could threaten the seemingly indefinite N-removal potential of denitrifiers in N-loaded riparian systems.

AB  - Nitrogen saturation of riparian ecosystems may lead to leaching and loss of surface water quality. In the search for early warning signs of N-saturation, we conducted an N-addition experiment to evaluate the indicator potential of free-living nematodes. During 6 months, we measured changes in feeding and life strategy groups, following single high and repeated low inorganic N-additions to a near-stream zone ('zone 1') and an upslope area ('zone 2') within a riparian forest in the southeast Coastal Plain of Georgia. In both zones, N-addition significantly increased the number of bacterivores but not fungivores. Only bacterivores with r-selected life strategies increased. In this group, Rhabditinae multiplied after N-addition in both zones, but Neodiplogasteridae and Myolaimidae responded to N only in zone 1, and Cephalobidae only in zone 2. Microbivore correlations with microbial data, collected concomitantly (Ettema et al., 1999. Riparian soil response to surface nitrogen input: temporal changes in denitrification, labile and microbial C and N pools, and bacterial and fungal respiration. Soil Biology & Biochemistry 31, 1609-1624), were considerably stronger in N-amended treatments than in controls, suggesting that N-addition synchronized microbial-microbivorous dynamics. At the end of the experiment, bacterivore abundance returned to control levels, probably partly due to predation, as predator populations had considerably increased several months after the first N-addition. The increase in predator abundance was greater in the single high than repeated low N-addition treatments, as was the case for bacterivore populations. These results suggest that nematodes can be indicators of N-saturation. However, for practical application, it appears that these indicators could only be meaningful when monitored together with other system characteristics, such denitrification rates and litter N.

AB  - Fire-scar and stand-cohort records were used to estimate the number and timing of fire disturbance events that impacted riparian and adjacent sideslope Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) forests. Data were gathered from 49 stream segments on 24 separate streams on the east slope of the Washington Cascade Range. Upslope forests had more “traceable” disturbance events than riparian forests in each of the valley types with a mean difference of 8–62%. Approximately 55–73% of the total traceable fire disturbance for a stream segment occurred on either sideslope and 24–27% in the riparian forest. Plant association groups in the riparian forest had 25–42% fewer fire disturbance events than the same plant association group upslope. Fewer traceable disturbance events in riparian forests may indicate a reduced disturbance frequency or a more severe disturbance regime or both. The two sideslopes on either side of the riparian forest shared the same fire event in 65 and 54% of the recorded fire events on east/west and north/south sideslopes, respectively. Riparian forests shared fire events with adjacent sideslope forests 58–79% among valley types, and 64–76% among aspects. Shared fire events indicate significant continuity in fire disturbance between riparian and adjacent sideslope forests. Fire disturbance regimes of sideslope and riparian forests are quantitatively different, but interconnected through shared fire disturbance events. Disturbance events play a role in maintaining ecosystem integrity and we suggest that disturbance may need to be planned for in administratively defined riparian buffer strips to protect long-term ecological integrity of riparian and adjacent upslope forests.

AB  - This PhD thesis seeks to consider conifer forestry stream corridor design in relation to both in-stream and riparian zone biodiversity and functioning. The contribution, availability and source of basal resources within varying corridor conditions are the focus of this project. This approach is combined with surveys of community diversity on a number of key trophic scales in order to determine how the corridor characteristics and their associated resource availability, affects community structure.The effects of varying design and management of the riparian buffer zones within afforested stream systems on in-stream and overall habitat diversity and functioning remains largely unknown. Although guidelines have been implemented for several years (Forest and Water Guidelines, Forestry Commission), recommendations, although based on sound assumptions, are subjective assessments and tend not based on scientific research or data. As such, the premise of this project is to consider a variety of corridor physical parameters adjacent to low-order streams within two afforested catchments in South-West Scotland, between 2003 and 2005, in order to contribute to the understanding of system functioning within the limitations of forestry land-use and management. A number of different approaches were employed in order to define the proportional contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous material within the benthos of the stream systems. This was done in order to define resource availability, biofilm characteristics, stream functioning and the role of corridor design in influencing resource availability. Yet, despite significant autochthonous productivity, allochthonous organic matter was the primary resource utilised by many taxa. However, conversely, light regime was found to be fundamental in shaping production and community structure within these ecosystems. Consequently, here I explore a number of different trophic scale responses to riparian conditions in order to define the biotic responses to variation of resource availability, with the aim of contributing information which may aid in design and management of afforested riparian zones.

AB  - Four fields (three organic and one conventionally managed) in an intensive vegetable producing landscape in eastern England were sampled for ground beetles in 2005 and 2006, using pitfall traps, to investigate species activity and species assemblage distribution within five crop and three field margin types. In addition, non-crop ditch sites were also sampled. Three species assemblages in the fields were strongly related to crop type, with two others consisting of non-crop sites, one dominated by field margins, the other by ditch sites. Species activity and richness in fields were also strongly, and significantly, associated with crop type, with most in organic Brassica crops (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli), less in organic leeks and least in conventional calabrese. Some species were significantly more active in weedier fields but others preferred more open ground. Considerably more species were recorded from first-year planted field margins, with fewest species active in unplanted margins. Activity was also relatively low in densely vegetated second-year margins. There appeared to be little relationship between species activity in the margins and that in the crop fields. Ground beetle species are important for the predation of cabbage root fly eggs in Brassica crops, especially in organic fields. In order to enhance and maximise appropriate ground beetle species activity and predation within vegetable fields, it is likely that management within both fields and margins would be required, as well as some method for increasing movement of predators from margins into fields.

AB  - Several studies have proven the importance of field margins in sustaining biodiversity and other work has been done on the effect of field management on field margin flora. However few models have been built to predict the effects of field management on the flora. Our project addresses this need for a model capable of predicting the effect of cropping techniques and their timing on the flora of field margins. Primula vulgaris is a biodiversity indicator, characteristic of undisturbed flora and found in field margins and woodlands: its population has been declining for several years. We created a temporal matrix model of P. vulgaris populations on field margins, taking into account the effects of field, field margin and roadside management based on literature and expert knowledge. We then analysed its sensitivity to demographic parameters by comparing lambda (growth rate) sensitivity and elasticity. We compared the management parameter effect using the relative growth rate of the population after 6years of simulation. Sensitivity analysis to biological parameters showed the importance of adult survival and seed production and germination. Results show that P. vulgaris is particularly sensitive to broad-spectrum herbicides and that other management techniques like early mowing, scything and scrub-killer (diluted broad-spectrum herbicide or specific herbicide) are less aggressive. Our simulations show that management of cash crops in Brittany is too aggressive for P. vulgaris populations and that 4–5years of grassland in the adjacent field are necessary to maintain populations.

AB  - We compared how coexistence in maize at the farm level was i) envisioned in the east of France where GM have never been really cropped, and ii) managed in the south of France where GM maize was cropped in 2006 and 2007. Surveys in respectively 27 and 23 contrasted farms were made in maize-rich sub-regions with high maize pest pressure. Sampling farms for diversity, we used semi-directive interviews with two different protocols for the 2 regions. After data analysis, we identified factors explaining the choice of GM or NGM maize cropping like: presence of maize specialty crops (no GM), presence of other technical scope of progress for maize yield (no GM), perception of corn borer as a risk (more GM) or return time of maize (more GM when maize is frequent). We also identified the different coexistence means preferred according to the region: buffer zone in the South of France with its large fields and sowing period shifts in the East of France where available sowing days are plenty in the spring. We also found out that the results of the first year of testing the GM crop may be the main factor explaining GM maize adoption or abandonment. We will use these results to build a multi-criteria model of maize allocation in a small region.

In this overview, the conditions of physical environment and some of the phsico-chemical parameters of Hajamro creek, (one of the major creek of Indus Deltaic region near Keti-Bunder) have been presented. Detailed seasonal surveys were carried out during 2005-2006 in active Indus Deltaic Areas of Pakistan. The seasonal pattern of physico-chemical parameters and chlorophyll a values were observed. The general trend of the physico-chemical parameters showed that their values are highest during the hottest months; the reasons are more decomposition, highest litter fall, and more downstream discharge during the monsoon months. The minimum value of the chlorophyll a was observed in the months of February, August and September and the maximum value in June, the rainiest season of the year, as well as, the down

AB  - Habitat loss and reduction in quality, together with increasing homogeneity of the farmed landscape and more intensive field management, are believed to be major drivers of biodiversity loss on farmland. Organic farms demonstrate features that are now rare elsewhere in UK farming systems, such as crop rotations incorporating grass leys, exclusion of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and reliance on animal and green manures. They may also contain greater densities of uncropped habitats such as hedgerows. In this study, we examined whether organic farming affected populations of one group of insects of conservation interest, butterflies, on farmland. The abundance of butterflies on pairs of organically and conventionally managed farms was recorded over 3 years and a number of habitat and crop variables, likely to be related to butterfly abundance, were also measured. Organic farms attracted significantly more butterflies overall than conventional farms. Significantly more butterflies in both farming systems were recorded over the uncropped field margin than the crop edge. The difference in butterfly abundance between crop edge and field margin was relatively greater in conventional than organic systems. Species richness of butterflies tended to be greater on organic farms. Five species of butterfly were significantly more abundant on organic farms in at least 1 year, while no species was significantly more abundant on conventional farms. Organic and conventional cropping patterns differed, the former having proportionally more grass leys, and hedgerows were larger on organic farms. Although no significant effects of farming system on the numbers of grass or forb species present in the field margin or crop edge were detected, some individual plant species showed differences in frequency between organic and conventional field boundaries. Increasing the extent of organic farming, or practices associated with it, could help to restore biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Agri-environment measures cover at least 20% of the EU's farmland, a proportion rising to approximately 30% in Ireland. A study, investigating effects on biodiversity of Ireland's Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) is described. Field margin flora and Carabidae (ground beetle) fauna were surveyed on 60 paired agreement and non-agreement farms. Greater variation was observed amongst surveyed non-agreement farms: the most species-rich and species-poor farms were all non-agreement. On surveyed grassland farms, average plant species richness was significantly higher on non-agreement than on agreement farms. Otherwise, few differences between average species richness and abundance on agreement and non-agreement farms were revealed. In ordination analysis of the flora and carabidae data factors largely independent of recent management, such as hedge age and gappiness, were most important in explaining observed variation. The study concluded that the scheme has not significantly benefited the groups surveyed, and suggests that the generic measures in such horizontal schemes may be better suited to addressing landscape-level issues such as water pollution, with biodiversity objectives for high nature value areas being more effectively achieved by targeted zonal schemes. Baseline data and long-term monitoring of measurable objectives are essential for effective evaluation, both to better tailor these innovative schemes to their aims, and to clearly demonstrate their benefits.

AB  - There are very few studies on the diversity and public health significance of Cryptosporidium species in zebu cattle and water buffaloes in developing countries. In this study, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene were used to genotype Cryptosporidium specimens from 12 zebu cattle calves, 16 water buffalo calves, and four swamp deer (Cervus duvaucelii) collected from the buffer zone of the Chitwan National Park, Nepal. All Cryptosporidium specimens from cattle and buffaloes belonged to Cryptosporidium ryanae, whereas those from deer belonged to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. Comparison of the SSU rRNA gene sequences obtained with those from earlier studies has identified a nucleotide substitution unique to all C. ryanae isolates from Nepal, in addition to some sequence heterogeneity among different copies of the gene. The finding of the dominance of a unique C. ryanae variant in both zebu cattle and water buffaloes in Nepal indicates that there is unique cryptosporidiosis transmission in bovine animals in the study area, and cross-species transmission of some Cryptosporidium spp. can occur between related animal species sharing the same habitats.

AB  - Understanding landscape correlates of local habitat integrity and community structure and the identification of spatial scales at which these associations operate are relevant for management and conservation of unique but globally threatened temporary ponds. We use a multivariate variance decomposition approach to determine taxon-specific associations of zooplankton communities banked in dry pond soils (rotifers, cladocerans, copepods) with local habitat features and landscape characteristics across four spatial scales (100 buffer strip, 1, 5, and 10 km scales). Results show similar degrees of correlation between rotifer and cladoceran communities with local habitat conditions (chiefly water quality). This is interpreted according to life-history traits of component species of wetland propagule banks. Associations with landscape features varied between communities with rotifers correlating with landscape structural features only at the buffer scale while cladocerans showed no significant correlations with landscape characteristics across all scales. Copepods were neither significantly associated with local nor landscape characteristics. The results of this study contrast strikingly with our previous population-based study, where populations of Triops cancriformis and Branchinecta orientales were significantly correlated with landuse features at the broadest scale. The combined results suggest that a three-way management scheme could be useful for conservation of zooplankton resting egg banks in this remnant wetland complex. These schemes could focus on the restoration of wetland water quality, the establishment of vegetated buffer strips around the ponds to counteract degradation resulting from runoff, and reforestation and/or the creation of hedgerows in agricultural catchments to avoid impacts resulting from broad-scale diffuse pollution fluxes.

The counts were conducted in the period between March 2007 and February 2008. This established 40 plots, using the census method counts at fixed points. The plot size was 15 m radius and the distance between points ranged between 100 and 200 m. The observations were made in the hours between sunrise and 10:00 or 11:00 a.m., with a stay of 15 minutes at each point and 10 minutes for the transfer of the two observers. Individuals observed were identified by stratum: Low (from ground level to 2 m in height) Medium (between 2 and 6 m) and Alto (heights above 6 m). All individuals were recorded by species seen or heard within each sampling point. Among the main findings were reported: 53 species of forest birds belonging to 11 orders and 24 families. 60.4% of total species recorded in the area are permanent residents, 26.4% are winter residents and 41.5% are endemic species or subspecies. The most abundant species are insectivores which represent 64% of the total, followed by granivores - fruit bats, upper and middle strata were the employees, showed higher abundance in both strata, the Pine Warbler (Dendroica pityophila Gundlach) Warbler and Climber (Mniotilta varies Linnaeus).

AB  - Addressing food insecurity has become an important policy issue due to a host of factors such as climate change, export restraints, alternative uses of food, e.g., as bio-fuels and income induced demand changes. The world has to find avenues to provide sufficient food to cater for the new developments in the food sector taking into consideration the risks of the changes these may effect on the environment. Paddy, the staple food crop of Sri Lankans, plays a significant role in stabilizing food security in the country. The production levels of paddy have been accompanied with wide regional variations due to irregularities in the rainfall patterns and cyclical effects of the production fluctuations. More thrust has been placed on irrigated paddy production in the areas of the dry zone, while traditional areas of the wet zone have been subjected to immense population pressure amidst various institutional arrangements. At present, more than half of the paddy output comes from the major irrigation schemes. The wide fluctuations in paddy production levels in these areas indicate the potential for regional vulnerability for food insecurity. This paper examines the growth of paddy production and evaluates the instability of paddy production in terms of the areas cultivated, productions and yields for the dry zone (DZ), intermediate zone (IZ) and wet zone (WZ) and districts in these climatic zones. The growth rates for different zones were estimated using a log linear function. The instability of area, production and yield was measured using a coefficient of the variation (CV). The CV of production, area and the yield for three major climatic zones and seasons are estimated. In addition, the indices for the risk of cultivation and amount of green vegetation on the island were used as indicators of instability. Paddy production has increased at the rate of around 2 % and 1 % per annum in the DZ and IZ, respectively; and has decreased in the WZ at the rate of 9 % per annum. The CVs for paddy production in the DZ, IZ and WZ in the maha and yala seasons are 18.15, 18.36, and 9.2 and 30.33, 25.38 and 19.22, respectively. The results indicate that instability of paddy production in the WZ is much lower than those of the other two zones. The lowest levels of instability with respect to production (Matara), yield (Kegalle) and harvested extent (Ratnapura) were observed in the wet zone districts. The highest level of instability with respect to area, yield, production and harvested extent was observed in the Anuradhapura District. In the maha season, the IZ shows the lowest variation in the sown extent and highest variation in the harvested extent, and it indicates the higher risk of production at the later stage of the crop. The IZ shows the general risk in paddy production in the yala season, indicated by the highest instability in both sown and harvested extents. Similar observations for the IZ were observed in the sown to harvest and CV of vegetation index. The negative growth rate observed in the WZ was brought about by the reduction of the cultivated area. The higher stability in production could be utilized to augment regional food security as well as the supply of seed paddy for other regions. Thus the results highlight the importance of maintaining WZ as a buffer zone of production and investments in irrigation in the IZ to secure the availability of paddy.

AB  - The planning and management of urban forest has become increasingly important as a focus of urban environmental management. The objectives of this study were to analyze the landuse/land cover and to map functional zones of the urban forest in the upper catchment area of Addis Ababa. This study identifies five landuse/land cover types: (i) Eucalyptus–Juniperus dominated forest, (ii) mixed native forest, (iii) built-up areas, (iv) Eucalyptus plantation (v) crop/grazing lands. The vegetation analysis shows 44 woody plant species representing 31 families, out of which 13 tree species, 29 shrubs and two species of lianas. The woody species diversity was 1.35 with the species richness and evenness of 44 and 0.80, respectively. This indicates that the forest has poor species diversity which is attributed to high anthropogenic pressure and monoculture plantation development strategies in the last decades. The density of plants ranged from 25 for Olea europea to 825 individuals per hectare for Eucalyptus globules from the tree layers and from 50 for Dombeya torrida and Erica arborea to 900 individuals per hectare for Myrsine africana from shrub layers. Based on importance value index (IVI), Eucalyptus globulus and Juniperus procera showed the highest IVI of 96.37 and 54.80, respectively as compared to other species. The forest structure showed higher contagious distribution where out of the recorded 44 species, 37 species showed contagious distribution. The result also showed poor regeneration potential in all studied forest layers. Based on the landuse/cover analysis, the phytosociological study and field observation, this study recommends six urban forest zoning. These include: (i) conservation zone, (ii) recreation zone, (iii) production zone, (iv) agroforestry zone, (v) reforestation zone, (vi) buffer zone between the green area and the built-up environment. The green area in the upper catchment has no definite boundaries and needs re-demarcation activities.

AB  - Studies on riparian buffers have usually focused on the amount of land needed as habitat for the terrestrial life stages of semiaquatic species. Nevertheless, the landscape surrounding wetlands is also important for other key processes, such as dispersal and the dynamics of metapopulations. Multiple elements that influence these processes should therefore be considered in the delineation of buffers. We analyzed landscape elements (forest cover, density of roads, and hydrographic network) in concentric buffers to evaluate the scale at which they influence stream amphibians in 77 distinct landscapes. To evaluate whether our results could be generalized to other contexts, we determined whether they were consistent across the study areas. Amphibians required buffers of 100-400 m of suitable terrestrial habitat, but interspecific differences in the amount of habitat were large. The presence of amphibians was related to roads and the hydrographic network at larger spatial scales (300-1500 m), which suggests that wider buffers are needed with these elements. This pattern probably arose because these elements influence dispersal and metapopulation persistence, processes that occur at large spatial scales. Furthermore, in some cases, analyses performed on different sets of landscapes provided different results, which suggests caution should be used when conservation recommendations are applied to disparate areas. Establishment of riparian buffers should not be focused only on riparian habitat, but should take a landscape perspective because semiaquatic species use multiple elements for different functions. This approach can be complex because different landscape elements require different spatial extents. Nevertheless, a shift of attention toward the management of different elements at multiple spatial scales is necessary for the long-term persistence of populations.

AB  - Forestry on peatland throughout the world is now focused on minimising destructive effects to the surrounding environment, especially during harvesting. These effects may be mitigated through the use of well-developed riparian buffers zones (RBZs). However, much of the commercial forestry planted in Ireland and the UK in the mid 20th century was planted without adequate RBZs. The creation of new RBZs prior to clearfelling may be a possible mitigation measure in these circumstances. The aim of this paper was to assess the nutrient content and phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity of the soil, and survival of planted saplings in a RBZ, positioned downslope from a standing forest and partly covered with brash mats, five years after its establishment. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were significantly higher under the brash mats in the RBZ when compared to all other areas.

AB  - Forestry on peatland throughout the world is now focused on minimising destructive effects to the surrounding environment, especially during harvesting. These effects may be mitigated through the use of well-developed riparian buffers zones (RBZs). However, much of the commercial forestry planted in Ireland and the UK in the mid 20th century was planted without adequate RBZs. The creation of new RBZs prior to clearfelling may be a possible mitigation measure in these circumstances. The aim of this paper was to assess the nutrient content and phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity of the soil, and survival of planted saplings in a RBZ, positioned downslope from a standing forest and partly covered with brash mats, five years after its establishment. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were significantly higher under the brash mats in the RBZ when compared to all other areas. The standing forest had the highest concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4 N), while total oxidised nitrogen (TON) was similar for all areas. Water extractable phosphorus and desorption-adsorption testing also confirmed the high concentrations of P under the brash mats, but P did not leach through the peat to the stream. The overall survival rate of the saplings was relatively high, with over half of Quercus robur (oak) (57 %), Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) (57 %) and Betula pendula (birch) (51 %) surviving. Salix cinerea (willow) (22 %), Alnus glutinosa (alder) (25 %) and Ilex aquifolium (holly) (44 %) did not survive as successfully. The RBZ was capable of providing nutrients for the survival of planted saplings, fertilizing the peat with degrading brash material and preventing elevated levels of nutrients entering the adjacent aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Gives detailed results of a project undertaken to improve the management of wild dogs in the tablelands environments in New South Wales. Specific areas of interest were to assess the efficacy of aerial baiting, to examine repopulation after baiting, to examine the effect of aerial baiting and the buffer zone concept, and to test more specific bait substrates to help improve bait effectiveness. Results showed that aerial baiting programs are an effective means of reducing wild dog populations and that the creation of a buffer zone between grazing lands and wild dog source areas is a successful means of reducing predation of livestock. To maintain very low populations in buffer zones supplementary control methods may be needed such as trapping, shooting or the electrification of dog resistant fences.

AB  - Containment can be a viable strategy for managing invasive plants, but it is not always cheaper than eradication. In many cases, converting a failed eradication programme to a containment programme is not economically justified. Despite this, many contemporary invasive plant management strategies invoke containment as a fallback for failed eradication, often without detailing how containment would be implemented. We demonstrate a generalized analysis of the costs of eradication and containment, applicable to any plant invasion for which infestation size, dispersal distance, seed bank lifetime and the economic discount rate are specified. We estimate the costs of adapting eradication and containment in response to six types of breach and calculate under what conditions containment may provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme. We provide simple, general formulae and plots that can be applied to any invasion and show that containment will be cheaper than eradication only when the size of the occupied zone exceeds a multiple of the dispersal distance determined by seed bank longevity and the discount rate. Containment becomes proportionally cheaper than eradication for invaders with smaller dispersal distances, longer lived seed banks, or for larger discount rates. Both containment and eradication programmes are at risk of breach. Containment is less exposed to risk from reproduction in the ‘occupied zone’ and three types of breach that lead to a larger ‘occupied zone’, but more exposed to one type of breach that leads to a larger ‘buffer zone’. For a well‐specified eradication programme, only the three types of breach leading to reproduction in or just outside the buffer zone can justify falling back to containment, and only if the expected costs of eradication and containment were comparable before the breach. Synthesis and applications. Weed management plans must apply a consistent definition of containment and provide sufficient implementation detail to assess its feasibility. If the infestation extent, dispersal capacity, seed bank longevity and economic discount rate are specified, the general results presented here can be used to assess whether containment can outperform eradication, and under what conditions it would provide a valid fallback to a breached eradication programme.

AB  - This study analyzes the factors driving interest in two agroforestry practices, riparian buffers and forest farming. Because agroforestry is outside main stream commodity production in US agriculture, the purpose is to evaluate a framework to understand attitudes. The framework incorporates Pierre Bourdieu's notions of "habitus" and "field" along with individual economic and demographic characteristics of farm operators' traditionally used in adoption studies. Four attitudes are analyzed: disengagers, conservatives, lifestyle, and accumulators.  A Logit regression measures the effects of respondents' attitudes, and other internal and external factors to assess interest in each practice. The data used is from a household survey of 364 farm-operators from the Fox Wyaconda watershed in northeast Missouri and Scott County in southeast Missouri gathered in 1999. Findings show that a conservative or a lifestyle attitude, are significant, with high probability of being interested in riparian buffers. Those with an accumulator or a lifestyle attitude have a significant and high probability of being interested in forest farming. Other variables also significant in riparian buffer interest are knowledge of agroforestry, and interest in
alternative farming practices, and especially having perceptions of erosion problems. In forest farming, a high value of farm and assets has a negative effect, while belonging to informal groups has a positive effect pointing to characteristics that do not belong to traditional farmers.

AB  - In this paper the potential of five hybrid poplar clones (Populus spp.) to provide biomass and wood volume in the riparian zone is assessed in four agroecosystems of southern Quebec (Canada). For all variables measured, significant Site effects were detected. Survival, biomass yield and volume yield were highest at the Bromptonville site. After 6 years of growth, total aboveground biomass production (stems + branches + leaves) reached 112.8 tDM/ha and total leafless biomass production (stems + branches) reached 101.1 tDM/ha at this site, while stem wood volume attained 237.5 m3/ha. Yields as low as 14.2 tDM/ha for total biomass and 24.8 m3/ha for total stem volume were also observed at the Magog site. Highest yields were obtained on the most fertile sites, particularly in terms of NO3 supply rate. Mean stem volume per tree was highly correlated with NO3 supply rate in soils (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.001). Clone effects were also detected for most of the variables measured. Total aboveground biomass and total stem volume production were high for clone 3729 (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) (73.1 tDM/ha and 134.2 m3/ha), although not statistically different from clone 915311 (P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera). However, mean whole-tree biomass (including leaves) was significantly higher for clone 3729 (38.8 kgDM/tree). Multifunctional agroforestry systems such as hybrid poplar riparian buffer strips are among the most sustainable ways to produce a high amount of biomass and wood in a short time period, while contributing to alleviate environmental problems such as agricultural non-point source pollution.

AB  - Riparian vegetation has a critical role to play in non-point source pollution abatement and water quality protection within watersheds in agricultural areas. In addition to their water quality function, riparian buffers also have the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon (C). In this study, the C and nutrient sequestration by five unrelated hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) clones growing in the riparian zone of four southern Quebec (Canada) agroecosystems is measured aboveground after 6 years of growth and compared to free-growing (unmanaged) herbaceous buffer strips. Very large differences in C sequestration and nutrient accumulation in hybrid poplar buffers were observed across the four agricultural riparian sites. For all variables measured in this study, the largest effect detected by the ANOVA was the Site effect. While C sequestration, N and P accumulation in total aboveground biomass were, respectively 52tha⁻¹, 770kgha⁻¹ and 82kgha⁻¹ at the Bromptonville site, these values were as low as 6.4tha⁻¹, 90kgha⁻¹ and 10kgha⁻¹ at the Magog site. Site fertility, in terms of NO₃ supply rate, was the main factor controlling biomass growth, and consequently C sequestration and nutrient accumulation in hybrid poplars. Although Site effect was by far the largest effect in this study, the Clone effect was also important, with clone 3729 (Populus nigra L.× Populus maximowiczii A. Henry) being the most effective for C and nutrient sequestration. Across the four study sites, total aboveground C sequestration, N and P accumulation at the site level could be, respectively enhanced by 31-37%, 29-41% and 30-38% with the sole use of clone 3729. Site×Clone interactions for the variables tested in this study were generally not significant, or significant but small in magnitude compared to main effects (Site and Clone). Important C and nutrient accumulation differences exist after 6 years of growth between hybrid poplar buffers and unmanaged herbaceous buffers. Compared to an unmanaged herbaceous buffer, the distinct advantage of hybrid poplar buffers is that C and nutrient sequestration greatly increase with increasing site fertility, whereas they do so to a much lesser extent in herbaceous buffers.

AB  - A sampling program of 9 years revealed that the opossum shrimp <em>Mysis relicta</em> and the amphipod <em>Diporeia hoyi</em> were present in three boreal lakes in northwestern Ontario, Canada regardless of whether watershed forests were left completely intact, left as only a narrow buffer strip, or were nearly completely removed through experimental clearcutting. In fact, <em>Diporeia</em> were actually found to be more abundant in all lakes following logging. And the decline in <em>Mysis</em> abundance observed in one of the lakes occurred well before the initiation of timber removal. Consequently, it appears that these keystone, glacial-relic species of macrocrustaceans are not negatively impacted by clearcutting. This is in direct contrast to the hyper-sensitivity and extirpation of these same species which has been previously demonstrated in acidifying boreal lakes. <br />

As for their distribution among buffer zones, 32 % of the samples belonged to the carbonate buffer zone, 32 % to the exchange zone, 11 % to the silicate and 25 % to the Al and Al-Fe buffer zones. For lessivated brown forest soil, the most frequently occurring soil type, there was a sharp drop in the proportion of the carbonate buffer zone, with a rise in the exchange buffer zone (15 and 45 %). The distribution of pH values for each soil layer according to buffer zones was least favourable in the 5-20 cm layer. At present, the pH values and their distribution according to buffer zones are favourably compared to similar data from neighbouring countries

AB  - The possibility of increased production of genetically modified (GM) crops in agriculture accentuates the need to examine the feasibility of GM and non-GM technologies co-existing on a common physical landscape. Using the theory of clubs, this paper examines the possibility of co-existence for GM and organic wheat technologies through the formation of an organic club with an endogenously determined buffer zone. Given the available data on prices, and yields, it is shown that a club can be created in which GM and organic agricultural production technologies can economically co-exist in the same physical landscape. Specifically, co-existence results in an increase in economic welfare over a situation where only GM technology is used but is not Pareto superior because producers in the buffer zone will incur injury. We show that organic producers in the club can compensate producers in the buffer zone and still be better off. Hence, the compensation principle holds.

AB  - Application of animal manures in excessive amounts can result in surface runoff of nutrients and degradation of surface water. Best management practices that use chemical or by-products to sorb nutrients can reduce nutrient loss from agricultural land. The objective of this work was to determine the ability of water treatment residual (WTR) to reduce N and P runoff from land treated with poultry litter. Different WTR (ABJ or WISTER) were used in two experiments at different locations. Three WTR treatments were applied to plots that received poultry litter at 6.72 Mg ha(-1) broadcast on bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] pasture. Treatments were broadcast (11.2 or 44.8 Mg ha(-1)), and a buffer strip (44.8 Mg ha(-1)) to the bottom 2.44 m of the plot. Experimental plots received simulated rainfall for 75 min at 6.35 cm h(-1) within 24 h of litter and WTR application. Nitrogen, NH(4), P, Al, and dissolved solids in surface runoff were determined. Mean dissolved P of 15.0 mg L(-1) was reduced to 8.60 mg L(-1) by the high broadcast and to 8.12 mg L(-1) by the buffer strip ABJ treatments. Reductions in runoff P were attributed to amorphous Al in the WTR. Soluble NH(4)-N was reduced from 33.7 to 11.3 mg L(-1) (high broadcast) and to 17.9 mg L(-1) (buffer strip) by ABJ. WlSTER did not, however, reduce soluble NH(4)-N or total N. Reduction in NH(4)-N was related to cation-exchange capacity of the WTR. Land application of WTR did not increase dissolved solids or Al in surface runoff.

AB  - The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was developed by the Blacklands Research and Extension Center in Temple, Texas. APEX is a flexible and dynamic tool that is capable of simulating a wide array of management practices, cropping systems, and other land use across a broad range of agricultural landscapes, including whole farms and small watersheds. The model can be configured for novel land management strategies, such as filter strip impacts on pollutant losses from upslope cropfields, intensive rotational grazing scenarios depicting movement of cows between paddocks, vegetated grassed waterways in combination with filter strip impacts, and land application of manure removal from livestock feedlots or waste storage ponds. A description of the APEX model is provided, including an overview of all the major components in the model. Applications of the model are then reviewed, starting with livestock manure and other management scenarios performed for Livestock and the Environment: A National Pilot Project (NPP), and then continuing with feedlot, pesticide, forestry, buffer strip, conservation practice, and other management or land use scenarios performed at the plot, field, watershed, or regional scale. The application descriptions include a summary of calibration and/or validation results obtained for the different NPP assessments as well as for other APEX simulation studies. Available APEX Geographic Information System–based or Windows-based interfaces are also described, as are forthcoming future improvements and additional research needs for the model.

AB  - As an earlier proclaimed national park, Mount Kanla-on in Negros Island became an initial component of the Philippines' National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) with the enactment of Republic Act 7586 (NIPAS Act) in 1992. The ecological, economic, social and cultural significance of the 24,557-hectare national park has been affirmed with numerous studies that merited its protected area designation by virtue of RA 9154 or Mount Kanla-on National Park Act of 2001. Such declaration, however, provided opportunity for the delineation of a buffer zone for geothermal energy development project. It stemmed from the proposal of the government-controlled Philippine National Oil Corporation-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) to tap geothermal energy that cannot be sourced out without encroaching on the original boundary of the PA. The proposal became an important conservation issue that captured the attention of both government and non-government sectors in the country. It also received opposition from several groups composed mostly of non-government and people's organizations because of the negative impacts it would likely create. Other institutions particularly the local government units expressed support over the project to ensure energy security, as well as the social, economic and even ecological benefits it may provide. This paper hopes to provide insights on how Mount Kanla-on was established as a PA and its adjoining site as a buffer zone for geothermal energy development. This will also attempt to discuss issues and concerns related to energy development and its implications on PA management and biodiversity in general

AB  - The fate and transport of atrazine and three of its major degradation products were studied in a restored forested riparian buffer system in southern Georgia to examine the effectiveness of the system in attenuating the chemicals. Atrazine was applied to a 10 x 100 m strip immediately upslope from the buffer system, and atrazine, deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, and hydroxyatrazine were monitored in groundwater, soil, and runoff water for 11 months following application. Atrazine removal from groundwater was very effective, with the calculated 3810 mg entering the upslope position being reduced to 174 mg exiting the streamside landscape position. Each of the landscape positions (0, 8, 13, 18, 28, and 38 m from the application strip) in the buffer system contributed significantly to the atrazine concentration reduction in the initial three months following application, when the majority of atrazine was measured. Deethylatrazine is the primary result of biotic degradation and was the predominant degradation product in groundwater, with approximately 10% (379 mg) as much estimated to have entered the upper interface of the buffer system as did the parent atrazine. The riparian buffer system was successful in significantly reducing concentrations of deethylatrazine in groundwater in both the initial three months following application and in the final eight months of the study. Adsorption of the analytes to subsurface soils was minimal in this system. Deethylatrazine was also the predominant degradation product in the runoff water, but hydroxyatrazine was predominant in conjunction with runoff sediments. Removal efficiency of analyte mass loads in surface runoff water ranged from 92% to 100% as the chemicals were transported through the buffer system. While the mass load of atrazine associated with sediment was only 8% of that measured for the water phase, the mass loads of deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine (approximately 40%) and particularly hydroxyatrazine (75%) in sediments were proportionally much higher. About 98.6% of measured runoff water and sediment phase transport of atrazine occurred within the first few days following application as a result of an extended rainfall event. In contrast, roughly 45% of the deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine and only 16% of the hydroxyatrazine were measured in the first rain event sample. The results of this work indicate that riparian buffer systems can be successfully used to intercept atrazine and the studied degradation products in order to minimize contamination of natural water systems. Riparian buffers can provide year round attenuation, particularly for deethylatrazine. The importance of timing atrazine application to correspond with periods when there is no threat of rainfall is also emphasized.

AB  - Non-crop habitats provide important resources for natural enemies. Many natural enemies hibernate in non-crop habitats, from which they may colonise arable fields in the spring. Spring colonisation ensures annual repopulation of the crop with natural enemies, allowing them to keep pace with the development of pest populations. The availability of non-crop habitats can, therefore, be crucial to successful conservation biological control. We quantified the density of overwintering natural enemies near organic Brussels sprout crops in five different non-crop habitats (short grassy field margin, herbaceous field margin, herbaceous field margin under a tree line, ditch and forest). Soil and litter samples of non-crop habitats were taken at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Insects belonging to Staphylinidae, Araneae, Carabidae, Coccinellidae and Dermaptera were the most abundant. Mean densities of predatory arthropods were higher in the open agricultural landscape (290 predators m⁻²) than in the forested landscape (137 predators m⁻²). Herbaceous habitat types supported the highest densities of overwintering predators (up to 400 predators m⁻²), whereas densities in the forest were lowest (10 predators m⁻²). These results indicate that herbaceous non-crop habitats are important refugia for predators and may play a vital role in conservation biological control.

AB  - Many studies dealing with water flow in soil require water application through ponding. A method is described for the preparation of a large number of adjacent ponded field plots for experimental purposes. Individual plots are enclosed by corrosion-resistant, metal strips extending 20 cm into the soil. A single border area around each group of plots functions as a buffer zone, similar to the outer zone of a double-ring infiltrometer. Simultaneous uniform ponding of individual plots and the border area is achieved by a newtork of bubbler sprinkler units, with each plot having a separate water flow meter and valve unit to control the rate and amount of each irrigation episode. Such a system enabled study of the influence of macropore structure on the transport of various pesticides and dyes under continuous and intermittent flood irrigation

AB  - Subsurface soil water dynamics can influence crop growth and the fate of surface-applied fertilizers and pesticides. Recently, a method was proposed using only ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and digital elevation maps (DEMs) to identify locations where subsurface water converged into discrete pathways. For this study, the GPR protocol for identifying horizontal subsurface flow pathways was extended to a 3.2-ha field, uncertainty is discussed, and soil moisture and yield patterns are presented as confirming evidence of the extent of the subsurface flow pathways. Observed soil water contents supported the existence of discrete preferential funnel flow processes occurring near the GPR-identified preferential flow pathways. Soil moisture also played a critical role in the formation of corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield patterns with yield spatial patterns being similar for mild and severe drought conditions. A buffer zone protocol was introduced that allowed the impact of subsurface flow pathways on corn grain yield to be quantified. Results indicate that when a GPR-identified subsurface clay layer was within 2 m of the soil surface, there was a beneficial impact on yield during a drought year. Furthermore, the buffer zone analysis demonstrated that corn grain yields decreased as the horizontal distance from the GPR-identified subsurface flow pathways increased during a drought year. Averaged real-time soil moisture contents at 0.1 m also decreased with increasing distance from the GPR-identified flow pathways. This research suggests that subsurface flow pathways exist and influence soil moisture and corn grain yield patterns.

AB  - Changes of soil microbial community caused by the heterogeneity of abiotic and biotic environment were studied in the reserve Dobroč, Slovakia. Data on vegetation, microclimate, soil properties and microbial activity were collected on two linear transects crossing both the core of the reserve and the buffer zone. In contrast to expectations, the variation of most environmental variables was comparable or even higher in the buffer zone than in the old-growth forest. Beta diversity was much higher in the natural forest, which coincided with differentiation patterns of trees and understory plants. Mantel correlations between microbial community indicators and environmental variables showed that soil chemistry and vegetation diversity were the most important determinants of microbial activity. Redundance analysis of microbial data identified potassium content, plant richness and influence of fir as the drivers of functional group composition. Inconsistency of correlations of microbial community characteristics with environmental variables indicates that different processes associated with the demography and functions of microbiota are driven by different environmental factors. Amount and variety of substrates available for decomposition seems to influence microbial community more than microclimate.

AB  - We studied (14 500 h of field observations during 20 breeding attempts by 10 pairs) the effects of human activities on the behaviour of breeding Spanish imperial eagles. The probability that human activities around nest sites provoked a flight reaction varied significantly among territories and among types of activity, and increased when the distance between the activity and the nest site decreased, and increased when the number of people involved in each intrusion was higher. Pedestrian activities (mainly by hunters, campers and ecotourists) caused more flight reactions than vehicles. Overall, the probability of a reaction increased sharply when activities occurred at less than 450 m from the nest, but was negligible if they occurred at 800 m. Reaction probability was lower in territories with higher intrusion frequencies (which suggests that some habituation occurs), where the nest was not visible from the tracks, and in less 'plain' or 'accessible' territories. Hatching rate was affected negatively by the frequency of human activities. Our results suggest that the critical inner buffer zone around Spanish imperial eagle nests should be established at a minimum radius of 500 m, and the vulnerable zones at a minimum of 800 m, bearing in mind the physiography of the terrain and the visibility of the nests. Finally, in future studies of nest-site selection with this species, it would be advisable to use a variable that quantifies (through field observations) human disturbance frequency.

AB  - In the countries of European Commuity the scheme of a step-by-step forecasting detailing to estimate pesticide risks for environment is used. The scheme consists of 4 steps, the each of them means more compound mathematical models and more realistic input data for the models n compare with the previous steps. The step 1 (the worst case) implies a momentum pesticide intake into a water reservoir. At the output a pesticide maximum concentration in the system "water - bottom set" is fixed. The step 2 takes into account a possible recommended multiple pesticide application during a vegetative period. The step 3 take into account crop and water reservoir types, topography, soil and climate territory features. At the step 4 more detailed calculations are done, data of a soil and climate zone are precised; it is possible to allow input restrictions for pesticide using. An approbation of this scheme has been hold taking the insecticide Dimetoat as an example in the territory of the Russian Federation. An application rate of Dimetoat was 0.6 kg/ha, a treatment number was 1 and a tested culture was spring wheat. Predictable concentrations were compared with Dimetoat MPC (maximum permissible concentration) in water reservoirs of fisheries (1.4 milli kg/l). It was determined after using the all 4 steps that a harmful level could be exceeded only at the day of application when the insecticide could get into a water reservoir with influx at the moment of treatment. Predictable concentrations were lower than harmful levels when a buffer zone was extended up to 10 m. The approbated scheme was concluded to be useful for the procedure of new pesticides registration.

AB  - Efforts to manage National Forests in the USA for wood production, while protecting water quality, are currently constrained by models that do not address the temporal dynamics of variable non-point source (NPS) areas. NPS areas are diffuse sources of contaminants contributed mostly by runoff as a result of different land use activities. Riparian vegetative buffers are often used to control contaminants from NPS areas but defining suitable widths require different policy considerations. In this study, the approach for defining suitable buffer widths is to apply a distributed process-based model that predicts potential NPS areas prone to generating runoff in relation to overland flow distances. A case study of the concept was applied to the 72km² Pete King watershed located in the Clearwater National Forest (CNF) in central Idaho, USA. This grid modeling approach is based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) and it integrates the soil moisture routing (SMR) model with probabilistic analysis. The SMR model is a daily water balance model that simulates the hydrology of forested watersheds using real or stochastically generated climate data, a digital elevation model, soil, and land use data. The probabilistic analysis incorporates the variability of soil depth and accounts for uncertainties associated with the prediction of NPS areas using Monte Carlo simulation. A 1-year simulation for the case study location was performed to examine the spatial and temporal changes in NPS areas prone to generating runoff. The results of the simulation indicate that the seasonal variability of saturated areas determines the spatial dynamics of the potential NPS pollution. Use of this model for the design of riparian buffer widths would increase the effectiveness of decision-making in forest management and planning by mapping or delineating NPS areas likely to transport contaminants to perennial surface water bodies.

AB  - Conservation practices, such as buffers, are often installed to mitigate the effects of nutrients and sediment runoff from agricultural practices. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was developed as process-based model to evaluate the fate of nutrients and sediment through a riparian buffer up to the edge of a stream. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was performed on REMM to evaluate the effects that changing herbaceous buffer scenarios have on N, P, and sediment in surface and ground water. Vegetation characteristics such as rooting depth, LAI, and plant height, along with some physical buffer characteristics were varied within their "typical" range and compared to a "base case" scenario. Model outputs were not sensitive to plant height or LAI, but moderately sensitive to changes in SLA. Model outputs were only sensitive to rooting depth as roots became shallower in the soil profile. Sediment yield and dissolved nitrate in surface water were the most sensitive to changes in Manning's n, while other soil physical characteristics such as surface roughness, surface condition, and % bare soil had little to no effect on model outcomes. Dissolved surface nitrate, organic P, and dissolved subsurface nitrate were all moderately sensitive to changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity and the slope of the buffer. Results indicate that within the model, many vegetation characteristics do not directly play a role in the physical transport of nutrients and sediment in surface and subsurface water; therefore, utilizing REMM to evaluate effects of specific herbaceous plant types may have limited value unless specific leaf area or rooting depth are considered. It would be possible to model and perhaps achieve specific load reductions by modifying slope and other physical characteristics or by considering forest versus grass buffers.

AB  - Lysimeter soils under 41-yr-old stands of chaparral species and a pine (Pinus coulteri B. Don) were studied to determine the biotic influence on soil morphologic development. The large (5.3 by 5.3 by 2.1 m) unconfined lysimeters at the San Dimas Experimental Forest in southern California were filled in 1937 with homogenized fine sandy loam soil material derived from diorite. After a 9-yr stabilization period, the lysimeters were planted with monocultures of species common to California chaparral ecosystems. The species represented, each on a separate lysimeter and its surrounding buffer zone, are scrub oak (Quercus dumosa Nutt.), ceanothus (Ceanothus crassifolia Torr.), chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. and Arn.), and Coulter pine. The soils were described and sampled in triplicate in 1987. Differences in earthworm (including Aporrectodea trapezoides Duges and Allolobophora chlorotica Savigny) activity were related to plant species and played a major role in differentiating the soils. Earthworm activity under scrub oak and ceanothus produced A horizons (7 and 2 cm thick, respectively), composed largely of worm casts, that were darker and enriched in clay compared with underlying C horizons and archived fill material. Earthworm activity was minimal under chamise, and relatively little morphologic development was apparent. The soil under pine, where earthworms were absent, had a clay-depleted A horizon (1 cm thick) and Bt horizons with sufficient clay increase, illuviation argillans, and thickness to qualify as an argillic horizon. Mixing and sorting of soil by earthworms has acted against argillic horizon development under the other plant species

AB  - Reserves are frequently constrained in design and size by various financial, social or political factors. Maintenance of existing reserves must therefore rely on strategic management practices, and prioritization of conservation activities within them. Identification of global and regional hotspots have been effective for prioritizing conservation activities. Yet, identification of micro-hotspots, or overlapping areas of endemic and rare species that are under threat at the landscape scale, have largely been ignored. From a reserve management point of view, knowledge of critical micro-hotspots within a reserve, are focal points for directing cost effective, conservation initiatives, especially removal of invasive alien plants which are a major threat to biodiversity. Using diversity patterns of dragonfly assemblages, many endemic and threatened, within a biosphere reserve located in the core of a global biodiversity hotspot, we investigated the concept of micro-hotspots. As biosphere reserves contain zones with varying degrees of anthropogenic impact, we also investigated the value of buffer and transition zones for complementing the dragonfly fauna of the reserve core. We found a distinct micro-hotspot within the protected core zone which shows concordance for both endemism and species richness. We conclude that focused conservation actions to remove invasive alien plants within this micro-hotspot would help insure its continued integrity. Furthermore, while there is greater habitat degradation within the buffer and transition zones, they support many additional species, but not those necessarily endemic or threatened. The complementary value of buffer and transition zones therefore lies in increasing habitat heterogeneity and species richness of the whole reserve.

AB  - Buffer zones are areal or linear elements located on pollutant pathways between source zones and the aquatic environment that decrease pollutant fluxes between the entrance and exit of the buffer zone. They are of diverse natures according to the type of transfer that they intercept (superficial or subsurface water table) and the pollutants associated with these transfers. Their role is relatively well known at the local scale, but the development of spatially explicit models is necessary to quantify their impact at the outflow of a watershed, while taking into account multiple factors that drive fluxes. Even though they help understand and predict the effects of landscape structure on diffuse agricultural pollution, these models also show that buffer zones must only be considered as a complement to other actions aiming to reduce inputs. Management of buffer zones in a landscape must be multidisciplinary and implicate a variety of stakeholders in society.

AB  - This is a Regional Program Review (RPR)   of the World Bank's support for the MBC. The review is   framed around an assessment of five Global Environment   Facility (GEF)-financed World Bank implemented projects in   Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama that had   the common objective of consolidating the Mesoamerican   Biological Corridor (MBC). It also reports on the   achievements of trust fund activities, financed by the Bank   Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), that were   implemented parallel to the GEF/World Bank projects. The MBC   is a land-use planning system that spans Central America and   Mexico. It is designed to promote the conservation and   sustainable use of the region's natural resources. The   overall objective of the Bank's MBC projects of   consolidating the MBC was highly relevant. Although the   Central American land bridge is very small, it is estimated   to be home to 12 percent of the world's known species.   It harbors approximately 24,000 species of vascular plants   and over 500 species of mammals, many of which are endemic.   The MBC derives its legitimacy from the endorsement it   received at the Central American heads of state summit in 1997.

AB  - Vegetated filter strips (VFS) have become an important component of water quality improvement by reducing sediment and nutrients transport to surface water. This management practice is also beneficial for controlling manure-borne pathogen transport to surface water. The objective of this work was to assess the VFS efficiency and evaluate the uncertainty in predicting the microbial pollutant removal from overland flow in VFS. We used the kinematic wave overland flow model as implemented in KINEROS2 coupled with the convective-dispersive overland transport model which accounts for the reversible attachment-detachment and surface straining of infiltrating bacteria. The model was successfully calibrated with experimental data obtained from a series of simulated rainfall experiments at vegetated and bare sandy loam and clay loam plots, where fecal coliforms were released from manure slurry applied on the top of the plots. The calibrated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the VFS efficiency to the model parameters, rainfall duration, and intensity for a case study with a 6-m VFS placed at the edge of 200-m long field. The Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the VFS efficiency given the uncertainty in the model parameters and key inputs. The VFS efficiency was found to be <95% in 25%, <75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. Relatively long high-intensity rainfalls, low hydraulic conductivities, low net capillary drives of soil, and high soil moisture contents before rainfalls caused the partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms from the infiltration excess runoff.

AB  - Fishing activities worldwide have dramatically affected marine fish stocks and ecosystems. Marine protected areas (MPAs) with no-take zones may enhance fisheries, but empirical evidence of this is scant. We conducted a 4-year survey of fish catches around and within an MPA that was previously fully closed to fishing and then partially reopened under regulated comanaged fishing. In collaboration with the fishers and the MPA authority, we set the fishing effort and selected the gear to limit fishing impact on key fish predators, juvenile fish stage, and benthic communities and habitats. Within an adaptive comanagement framework, fishers agreed to reduce fishing effort if symptoms of overfishing were detected. We analyzed the temporal trends of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of the whole species assemblages and CPUE of the four most valuable and frequent species observed inside the opened buffer zone and outside the MPA investigated. After the comanaged opening, CPUE first declined and then stabilized at levels more than twice that of catches obtained outside the MPA. Our results suggest that working closely with fishers can result in greater fisheries catches. Partial protection of coastal areas together with adaptive comanagement involving fishers, scientists, and managers can effectively achieve conservation and fishery management goals and benefit fishing communities and alleviate overfishing.

AB  - Macaca fascicularis is a kind of animals called as "cigak" by ethnic Talang. Daily activity begins at 5.30 in the morning from riverside of "Gangsal" toward rubber plantation and crop land owned by the local people. The final destination is at "Bukit Kilangan". They move back to the same route at 4.30 in the afternoon. Seemingly, their home range is overlapping and unlimited. They are divided into two groups. The first group has 16 individuals, consisting of 5 adults, 7 youngsters, and 1 kid. The other group has 41 individuals, consisting of 16 adults, 10 youngster, and 15 kids. The population density is 38 individuals/square kilometer. Since this animals are considered as "enemy" by the local people, they are always driven away by creating a specific loud sound or killed by using an air riffle

AB  - In this study, we proposed a dynamic complex hypothesis that the impact of land use on water quality could vary along the expansion of the buffer size, and there should be an effective buffer zone where the strongest linkage occurs between land use and water quality. The hypothesis was tested and supported by a case study carried out in four watersheds in Hanyang District, China. More specific, buffer analysis and regression model were applied for studying the impacts of land use type, area proportion of land use type, and spatial pattern of land use on water quality. We conclude that not only the proportion of land use but also the spatial pattern moderates the impact of land use on water quality. Our study indicates that the identification of the effective buffer zones can provide new information and ideas for planning and management. Moreover, this study could also partially help to explain the conflicting results on the impact of land use on water quality in buffer versus in catchments in the literatures.

AB  - Human-killing is the ultimate expression of human-tiger conflict. It is a complex issue that needs to be addressed to maintain support for tiger (Panthera tigris) conservation in areas where human-killing is prevalent. This research was undertaken to investigate the ecological and sociological aspects of human-killing in the central lowlands of Nepal. We used 28 years of data from human-killing events in Chitwan National Park and the surrounding area to: (1) document the geographic distribution of human-killing incidents, (2) examine ecological variables associated with sites where humans were killed, (3) characterize human-killing tigers, and (4) identify human activities that make people vulnerable to attack. Finally, we use this information to recommend strategies to reduce human-tiger conflicts. Data on human-killing incidents and removal of human-killing tigers were obtained from veterinarian and Kathmandu Zoo records and by visiting the location of each kill with a victim's family member or friend. Thirty-six tigers killed 88 people from 1979 to 2006. Most (66%) kills were made within 1km of forest edge but equally in degraded and intact forests. An equal number of male and female tigers killed humans and 56% of tigers that were examined had physical deformities. The trend of human deaths increased significantly from an average of 1.2 (±1.2) persons per year prior to 1998 to 7.2 (±6.9) per year from 1998 to 2006. This difference is due primarily to a ten fold increase in killing in the buffer zone since 1998 because of forest restoration. Nearly half the people killed were grass/fodder collectors. Local participation in tiger management and conservation is essential to mitigate human-tiger conflicts. We recommend that villagers be recruited to help radio collar and monitor potentially dangerous tigers, participate in long term tiger monitoring, and attend a tiger conservation awareness program focused on tiger behavior and avoidance of conflict.

AB  - This study determined the bio-physical and chemical characteristics of the major river system and described the habitat of fish and shells in Apayao. Field survey and water analysis were conducted in 10 rivers found in Apayao, namely; Acutan, Nabuangan, Barren, Cabicungan, Laco, Karagawan, Nagan, Binuan, Zumigue and Ziwanan Rivers. Analysis of physico-chemical parameters of the river systems revealed that air and water temperatures range from 22 to 30 deg C, average water velocity 0.11-3.44 m/s, stoney to muddy bottom type, clear water, pH range of 7.32 to 7.97, average DO level and BOD of 6.11 and 2.96 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, these bio-physical and chemical parameters measured in the different rivers fall within the standards set by DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippines] for unpolluted rivers. The different rivers are inhabited by diverse fish and shell species. Activities within the rivers include fishing, bathing, swimming, washing, and transport of goods by the residents. The rivers provide an abundant water supply for irrigation as well as for domestic users. There are Dipterocarp species grown in the area, while shrubs and grasses dominate the buffer zone of the rivers. To conserve these freshwater resources, the 'Lapat' system is implemented in Apayao.

AB  - The effect of nitrogen (N) fixing trees on the surrounding plants is a not well understood phenomenon. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to study the effect of alder (Alnus firmifolia) on nearby red pine (Pinus patula) in a three-compartment pot separated by a fine plastic screen. The screen prevented roots from crossing over but allowed the passage of fungi hyphaes and soil solution. Red pine seedlings were grown in the lateral compartments. The central one was a buffer zone. Two substrates were assayed: a red pine forest and a mixed red pine-alder forest soil. One-half of the pots were fumigated. Pots with red pine in both lateral compartments were used as checks. The experiment lasted six months. The fresh and dry weight of the pine, as well as N and P concentrations were measured. Number and weight of nodules, nitrogenase activity, and N percentage in alder were also determined. Total soil N was tested at the end of the experiment. Total dry weight, N content and red pine diameter were higher when the pine grew in association with alder and non-fumigated soil. The positive effect of alder on red pine was related to the N2 fixing nodules in the former. Pine P concentration was higher when grown in monoculture and non-fumigated coniferous-forest soil. Soil fumigation caused a reduction of the population of mycorrhizal fungi and other beneficial microorganisms in the soil. Red pine in association with alder benefited from the N2 fixation of the latter species. Field plantations of mixed stands of P. patula and A. firmifolia could help to reduce the exploitation of the native soil N pool creating a more sustainable production system.

AB  - The export of dissolved phosphorus (P) in surface runoff from agricultural land can lead to water quality degradation. Surface application of aluminium (Al)-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs) to vegetated buffer strip (VBS) soils can enhance P removal from surface runoff during single runoff events. However, the longer-term effects on P removal in VBSs following application of products such as Al-WTR remain uncertain. We used field experimental plots to examine the long-term effects of applying a freshly generated Al-WTR to VBSs on dissolved P export during multiple runoff events, occurring between 1 day and 42 weeks after the application of Al-WTR. Vegetated buffer strip plots amended with Al-WTR significantly reduced soluble reactive P and total dissolved P concentrations in surface runoff compared to both unamended VBS plots and control plots. However, the effectiveness of Al-WTR decreased over time, by approximately 70 % after 42 weeks compared to a day following Al-WTR application. Reduced performance did not appear to be due to drying of Al-WTR in the field. Instead, the development of preferential flow paths as well as burying of Al-WTR with freshly deposited sediments may explain these observations. Better understanding of the processes controlling long-term P removal by Al-WTR is required for effective management of VBSs.

Results demonstrated that farm management characteristics determined nutrient management adoption, farm characteristics determined filter strip adoption, and human capital and farm characteristics played the largest role with streambank fencing adoption. Cost-share awareness was not found to increase the probability of adopting any BMPs and Extension education was found to positively and significantly increase the adoption of all three BMPs.

AB  - In this paper, elements of differential game theory are used to analyze a spatially explicit home range model for interacting wolf packs when movement behavior is uncertain. The model consists of a system of partial differential equations whose parameters reflect the movement behavior of individuals within each pack and whose steady-state solutions describe the patterns of space-use associated to each pack. By controlling the behavioral parameters in a spatially-dynamic fashion, packs adjust their patterns of movement so as to find a Nash-optimal balance between spreading their territory and avoiding conflict with hostile neighbors. On the mathematical side, we show that solving a nonzero-sum differential game corresponds to finding a non-invasible function-valued trait. From the ecological standpoint, when movement behavior is uncertain, the resulting evolutionarily stable equilibrium gives rise to a buffer-zone, or a no-wolf's land where deer are known to find refuge.

AB  - The increasing number of endangered species worldwide coupled with increasing management costs makes it imperative that decision makers understand the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for management alternatives. Few studies have attempted to estimate the public's WTP for different management strategies. The objective of this study was to estimate the WTP for various management attributes associated with the Korean mountain goral, an endangered species. Using primary data from a survey of visitors to Woraksan National Park, South Korea, WTP was estimated using a choice experiment format. Besides continued reintroduction, management practices valued were establishment of a core zone, establishment of a core plus a buffer preservation zone, and education concerning management of the goral. Specifically, WTP for increasing the number of gorals from the current status of 10 animals to 50 animals was approximately US $13.06 per household, whereas WTP for an increase from 10 to 200 gorals was $18.06 per household. WTP for a core zone was $20.34 per household, whereas WTP for a core zone plus buffer zone was $36.01 per household, giving a WTP of $15.67 per household for the buffer zone. Respondents' WTP for increasing education from 5% to 40% of the residents was $7.32 per household, which was smaller than increasing education levels from 40% to 60% of the residents ($11.96).

AB  - The global pollinator decline is commonly linked to modern intensive farming practices, partly because excessive herbicide and fertilizer use is thought to reduce pollinator food plant availability. This effect is particularly obvious across crop-/non-crop boundaries, but no study has compared pollinator and food plant abundance on adjacent crop- and roadside margins. We compared bumblebee abundance along 30 hedgerows in SW England; bordered either side by roads and arable fields (cultivated with wheat, barley, oilseed rape, or beans). Total bumblebee abundance along roadsides was over twice that observed on adjacent crop-facing margins, irrespective of crop type and this general pattern was apparent for three of the five most common bumblebee species, including generalist and specialist foragers. Both the total number of flowering plant species and the floral abundance of three of the five most visited plants was also higher on roadsides; minor variation between-crops was localised and unrelated to margin orientation. We conclude that organic farming may offer some advantages for pollinator conservation since it reduces field margin exposure to agro-chemical inputs. However, since conventional farming will remain central to global food production, modifications to current practices (such as the use of wildflower strips) are needed and may have ancillary benefits for pollinators by protecting arable margins from disturbance and agro-chemicals. In addition, the fact that the roadsides were demonstrably better habitats for pollinators and their food plants than field-facing margins underscores the widespread suggestion that roadside verges should be utilised more as a conservation tool to promote pollinator biodiversity.

One of the sites is inside a 5 ha highly prized old growth mixed Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies forest of high biodiversity which has been protected since 1940. The other two hollows are located 400 and 700 m away in an outlying buffer zone established in 1995 which is mainly coniferous plantation forest. The results show that the area has been forested for at least 2000 years, but that forest composition has been under continuous change, most rapid over the last 200 years. The reduction of deciduous tree pollen particularly Quercus, Tilia, Alnus and Corylus, and the immigration of Fagus and Picea can be observed at all three sites. However, the temperate deciduous trees (Quercus or Fagus) have been much more common in the ‘hotspot' than in the surrounding forests over the last c. 200 years, and significantly more common at least 2000 years before that. Even though the vegetation has been dynamic through time, the lower human intervention in the ‘hotspot' area compared with the surrounding matrix forests has facilitated the longevity of deciduous trees and the many rare species which are associated with them. The palaeoecological record of key species and information on past use of the wider forest area revealed in this study, indicates how future management will require flexibility to maintain conservation ‘hotspots'.

AB  - Intact riparian zones maintain aquatic–terrestrial ecosystem function and ultimately, waterway health. Effective riparian management is a major step towards improving the condition of waterways and usually involves the creation of a ‘buffer’ by fencing off the stream and planting vegetation. Determination of buffer widths often reflects logistical constraints (e.g. private land ownership, existing infrastructure) of riparian and adjacent areas, rather than relying on rigorous science. We used published information to support riparian width recommendations for waterways in agricultural Victoria, Australia. We focused on different ecological management objectives (e.g. nutrient reduction or erosion control) and scrutinised the applicability of data across different environmental contexts (e.g. adjacent land use or geomorphology). Not surprisingly, the evidence supported variable ‘effective’ riparian widths, depending on the objective and environmental context. We used this information to develop a framework for determining riparian buffer widths to meet a variety of ecological objectives in south‐east Australia. Widths for reducing nutrient inputs to waterways were most strongly supported with quantitative evidence and varied between 20 and 38 m depending on environmental context. The environmental context was inconsistently reported, making it difficult to recommend appropriate widths, under different land‐use and physiographic scenarios. The evidence to guide width determination generally had high levels of uncertainty. Despite the considerable amount of published riparian research, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that implemented widths achieved ecological objectives. We emphasise the need for managers to clearly articulate the objectives of proposed riparian management and carefully consider the environmental context. Monitoring ecological responses associated with different riparian buffer widths is essential to support future management decisions.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered as an effective tool in marine coastal management, and considered able to enhance local fisheries through adult fish spillover. Indirect evidence of fish spillover could be obtained by horizontal gradients in fish abundance. To address this question, the existence of gradients of fish abundance and biomass across marine reserve boundaries was assessed in six Mediterranean MPAs using underwater visual censuses performed at various distances from the core of the MPA, in integral reserve (IR), to buffer zone (BZ) and fished areas. A reserve effect was evidenced with higher values of fish species richness (x1.1), abundance (x1.3), and biomass (x4.7) recorded inside MPAs compared to adjacent fished areas. Linear correlations revealed significant negative gradients in mean fish biomass in all the reserves studied after the effect of habitat had been removed, whereas negative gradients in abundance were less conspicuous. Generalized additive models suggested two main patterns of biomass gradients, with a sharp decrease at the IR-BZ boundary or at the BZ-fished area boundary. It was estimated that fish spillover beneficial to local fisheries occurred mostly at a small spatial scale (100s of metres). The existence of regular patterns of negative fish biomass gradients from within MPAs to fished areas was consistent with the hypothesis of adult fish biomass spillover processes from marine reserves and could be considered as a general pattern in this Mediterranean region.

AB  - There is increasing realization that human perceptions of a 'patchy' environment do not necessarily relate to that of a particular organism and ecological characteristics of land adjacent to patches of natural vegetation ('remnants') may influence the ecological processes within. We investigated how the distribution and abundance of resources within and surrounding 39 small remnants located within the city of Melbourne, Australia, influenced the abundance of common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula (Phalangeridae) and common ringtail possums Pseudocheirus peregrinus (Pseudocheiridae), two primarily folivorous marsupials. Bayesian modelling techniques were used to relate the abundance of both possum species to estimates of den and food availability both within the remnant and within a 100-m buffer strip extending out into adjacent residential development. We found that both brushtail and ringtail possum abundance within remnants increased with the density of potential den sites within the remnant and food availability within the surrounding landscape. Ringtail possum density within the remnant further increased with den availability within the surrounding landscape. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that, in highly modified landscapes, processes originating outside a remnant vegetation patch may influence the abundance of species within.

AB  - The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge spans 77 km along the Detroit River and western Lake Erie, and is the only unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System that is international. A key unit of the refuge is the 166-ha Humbug Marsh that represents the last kilometer of natural shoreline on the U.S. mainland of the river and Michigan’s only “Wetland of International Importance” designated under the 1971 International Ramsar Convention. Adjacent to Humbug Marsh is an 18-ha former industrial manufacturing site (now called the Refuge Gateway) that is being remediated and restored as an ecological buffer for Humbug Marsh and the future home of the refuge’s visitor center. Restoration and redevelopment activities have included: cleanup and capping of contaminated lands; daylighting a creek (<em>i.e.</em>, deliberately exposing the flow of a creek that was historically placed underground in a culvert) and constructing a retention pond and emergent wetland to treat storm water prior to discharge to the Detroit River; restoring coastal wetland, riparian buffer, and upland habitats; and constructing two roads, hiking/biking trails, and a kayak/canoe landing to offer wildlife-compatible public uses that allow visitors to experience this internationally-recognized natural resource. This project has been described as transformational for the region by restoring an industrial brownfield into high quality wildlife habitat that expands the ecological buffer of a Ramsar site. Specific restoration targets for the site include: achieving a net gain of 6.5 ha of wetlands in a river that has lost 97% of its coastal wetlands to development; restoring 10.1 ha of upland buffer habitat; treating invasive <em>Phragmites </em>along 4 km of shoreline; and treatment of invasive plant species in 20.2 ha of upland habitats in Humbug Marsh. Further, the Refuge Gateway is being restored as a model of environmental sustainability for nearly seven million residents within a 45-minute drive. Key lessons learned include: reach broad-based agreement on a sustainability vision; identify and involve a key champion; establish core project delivery team; ensure up-front involvement of regulatory agencies; recruit and meaningfully involve many partners; expect the unexpected; practice adaptive management; place a priority on sound science-based decision making; ensure decision-making transparency; measure and celebrate successes, including benefits; and place a high priority on education and outreach.<strong></strong>

AB  - In certain regions of Canada and the United States, amphibians have been shown to be sensitive to forest management and the short-term adverse effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial amphibians have been well documented in the literature. However, the effects of silvicultural treatments on amphibians may not be realized until many years after treatment. Manipulative forest management experiments with pre- and post-treatment data, random assignment of replicates to treatments, and analyses over a large spatial scale are rare in the literature. Furthermore, even studies with pre- and post-treatment data can be affected by ecological time lags; the longevity of some species may mean that it could take several years to observe a treatment effect. Riparian areas in forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest have been recognized for high species richness of amphibians yet little is known about the persistence of amphibians in mature forest fragments such as unharvested riparian buffers surrounded by clearcuts. Our study investigated the efficacy, 2 and 10years post-logging, of two different riparian management zone prescriptions established around third- and fourth-order streams in western Washington to mitigate the effects of upland timber harvest on amphibians. Our findings suggest that there is no global response by terrestrial amphibians to logging or to the retention of riparian management zones. Rather, species showed individual responses that varied over time and between treatments and transects. Specifically Coastal Tailed Frogs (Ascaphus truei) declined in clearcut upland habitats 2- and 10-years following logging while Western Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon vehiculum) and Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) appear to benefit from the recommended riparian management zone width. The influence of site effects was evident for some species, whereas for others there is some suggestion of treatment effects, but the analyses were confounded by patterns of natural population change at both local and regional scales, which were evident 2years following logging. Our results exemplify the need for longer-term studies to ensure that potentially confounding factors, such as natural population fluctuation, are considered when interpreting the results of time series data.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS), on slopes of 5 and 11%, were used as a means of treating wastewater effluent from the second cell of a swine waste anaerobic lagoon system. Wastewater samples from both surface runoff and soil percolate (depths of 0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 m) were collected and analyzed for TKN-N, NH4-N, ON-N, NO3-N, pH, COD K EC, and TP-P. Using these analyses, along with the hydraulic loading rates and quantitative runoff collection, mass balances were calculated to determine the surface treatment of the lagoon effluent. Mass balance estimates suggest that the vegetative filter strip is an excellent treatment system for liquid lagoon effluents with mass reductions of greater than 34% (total solids) for all parameters on both slopes, except NO3-N, which had an approximate increase of 63% on the 11% slope. Samples collected from the three lysimeter depths (soil percolate) suggest that NO3-N leaching from the plots may be a concern over an extended period of use

AB  - Increasing concern about non-point source pollutants released from grazing livestock, a worldwide problem, motivated the present study on the effects of vegetative filter strips (VFS) for controlling pollutants (nutrients, micro-organisms and sediment loading) from grazed, irrigated pastures. Flood-irrigated pastures are an important source of forage for livestock during summer months in California, USA when the surrounding rangelands are dry and dormant. Significant amounts of runoff can be generated from these pastures during irrigation events. Nine plots on an irrigated pasture were assigned randomly to one of three treatments: Control (no VFS), Treatment VFS-1 (8·3x7 m, 0·0058 ha VFS) and Treatment VFS-2 (17·1x7 m, 0·012 ha VFS). In 2000, two grazing events (in April and June/July) occurred during the irrigation season prior to the experiment; further, the experimental plots were grazed between irrigations 2 and 3. Attenuation of runoff loads by VFS treatment was measured during four irrigation events (between 1 August and 3 October 2000) for total suspended solids (TSS), ortho-phosphate (Ortho-P), inorganic phosphate (Inorg-P), total phosphate (Total-P), organic phosphate (Org-P), polyphosphate (Poly-P), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NH3, NO3 and presumptive faecal coliforms (FC). On average, approximately 0·43 of the applied water left the plots as runoff. Treatment effects approached significance for TSS and TKN and were significant (P<0·05) for Poly-P and NH3. Irrigation number effects were significant for all but TSS, NO3 and FC. The effects of VFS treatments were not consistent. Treatment VFS-2, although representing the largest buffer strip, did not always produce the lowest pollutant loads in runoff. Slope, relatively high runoff volumes and some channelled flow were probably responsible for the limited effectiveness of VFS in the present study. These results suggest that effectiveness of VFS for reducing sediment and nutrient transport from irrigated pastures may be questionable.

AB  - Buffer zones are an important component of forest-management strategies and are thought to reduce the impact of nutrients released after harvesting on water quality. Conceptually, steep slopes have shorter water residence times than shallow slopes, have a reduced capacity to moderate water quality, and therefore, require wider buffers. Carbon and N concentrations in riparian zone shallow soil water at 30 cm depth and lake water were measured on shallow and steep slopes at the Esker Lakes Research Area in northeastern Ontario to determine if nutrient concentrations were correlated to catchment terrain attributes. Field measured slope, slope class obtained from a triangular irregular network model, and upslope contributing area and topographic index calculated from a digital elevation model were calculated for each sampling location. Modeled terrain properties, including those currently used during forest-management planning, were not significantly correlated with soil water N and C concentrations, whereas only dissolved organic carbon levels were significantly greater on field measured steep slopes. Forest species composition and soil N levels were positively correlated with soil water N concentrations. These results from the undisturbed boreal ecosystem highlight the potential limitation of using only catchment slope as a tool for prescribing riparian buffers during harvesting when considering terrestrial nutrient export.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones are known to reduce diffuse N pollution of streams by removing and modifying N from agricultural runoff. Denitrification, often identified as the key N removal process, is also considered as a major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The risks of high N2O emissions during nitrate mitigation and the environmental controls of emissions have been examined in relatively few riparian zones and the interactions between controls and emissions are still poorly understood. Our objectives were to assess the rates of N2O emission from riparian buffer zones that receive large loads of nitrate, and to evaluate various factors that are purported to control N emissions. Denitrification, nitrification, and N2O emissions were measured seasonally in grassland and forested buffer zones along first-order streams in the Netherlands. Lateral nitrate loading rates were high, up to 470 g N m−2 yr−1 Nitrogen process rates were determined using flux chamber measurements and incubation experiments. Nitrous oxide emissions were found to be significantly higher in the forested (20 kg N ha−1 yr−1) compared with the grassland buffer zone (2–4 kg N ha−1 yr−1), whereas denitrification rates were not significantly different. Higher rates of N2O emissions in the forested buffer zone were associated with higher nitrate concentrations in the ground water. We conclude that N transformation by nitrate-loaded buffer zones results in a significant increase of greenhouse gas emission. Considerable N2O fluxes measured in this study indicate that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodologies for quantifying indirect N2O emissions have to distinguish between agricultural uplands and riparian buffer zones in landscapes receiving large N inputs.

AB  - Rural households face numerous shocks – both individual/idiosyncratic (e.g. sickness; loss of livestock) and common (e.g. drought, flood). As household responses vary (e.g. increasing labour supply, sale of agricultural products, increased forest use), this presentation uses survey data from 1,100 households, covering five villages in the Gorongosa National Park buffer zone, Mozambique, to consider whether economic incentives influence household behaviour. It is concluded that Miombo woodlands are important to the household economy considering their support to livelihoods.

AB  - Experiments were carried out at the experimental farm of Sakha Agricultural Research Station in 2006/07 and 2007/08 sugar beet seasons. The spiders inhabiting the sugar beet fields were surveyed, which indicated to the occurrence of 30 spider species belonging to Araneidae, Dictynidae, Dysderidae, Gnaphosidae, Linyphiidae, Lycosidae, Miturgidae, Philodromidae, Salticidae, Tetragnathidae, Theridiidae and Thomisidae. In all sugar beet plantations (August, September and October), the pitfall traps captured more spiders of families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae (Ground-dwelling spiders) and Philodromidae and Salticidae (wandering spiders) than did D-vac machine which captured more linyphiids and araneids (orb-weaver. spiders). Population density of spiders in the field margins were usually greater than that inside the field for the seven considered families. Traps used inside the field captured less spiders than those used in the margins by 32.50-82.14 % overall spider families.

AB  - A substantial honeybee decline is being observed worldwide. Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical “honeybee-friendly” floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2m×2m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes.

AB  - Riparian buffers are designed as management practices to increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and transport of sediment and nonpoint source pollutants from crop fields to adjacent streams. Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.

AB  - Upwind advective energy occurring in edge environments may increase tree water use. In humid agricultural landscapes, advection-enhanced transpiration in riparian buffers may provide hydrologic regulation. The objectives of this study were to determine how water use by trees growing in a riparian buffer in central Iowa is influenced by 1) advective energy, 2) tree position, and 3) thinning (40% LAI reduction). We measured meteorological variables and sap flux density from July to September in 13 trees (2009) and 12 trees (2010) in one thinned plot (TP, treated in Aug 2010) and one untreated (control) plot (UP). The difference in Qs between edge and interior trees (39% higher in 2009) was attributed to the advective energy at the buffer edge. After thinning, maximum Qs increased was greater in TP compared to UP, explained primarily by solar radiation (R2=0.7, p<0.05), since meteorological conditions were not optimal for advection. However, the LAI reduction counteracted the increase in whole tree Qs, such that post-treatment plot transpiration per LAI measured from TP (0.4 mm day-1) was less than for UP (0.5 mm day-1).

AB  - Restoration of ecosystem functions in urban environments is made challenging by 1) a public that often lacks understanding of ecological principles, 2) inadequate evidence of the effectiveness of restoration practices, and 3) difficulty integrating social and biophysical factors in studies of urban ecosystems. This paper describes a case study in which potential solutions to these challenges were explored. We facilitated collaborative learning through public participation in the design and implementation of an urban riparian buffer along a headwater stream in a neighborhood park, a process that was informed by ecological research. Learning outcomes were evaluated using surveys and qualitative assessment of discussion. Results indicated that participants' knowledge about water quality problems associated with urbanization, stormwater, and nonpoint-source pollution increased, familiarity with stormwater management practices increased, and perceptions about the importance of stream ecosystem functions changed. In-stream monitoring of sediment delivery, as well as direct measurements of buffer infiltration capacity, provided early evidence of buffer effectiveness in prevention of sediment inputs to the stream and absorption of runoff from surrounding surfaces. This study provides a useful model for integration of collaborative learning through participation, ecological restoration, and ecological research in an urban setting. Elements deemed essential to success of this model included an opportunity for dialog focused on a specific natural feature, sustained interaction between participants and researchers, opportunities for hands-on participation by urban residents, and flexibility in restoration practice installation.

The LI forest has long been classified as a Hunting Park but there is strong support for changing the status to Nature Reserve or Sanctuary for several reasons. Observation on the flora and fauna were conducted from 21 May - 7 June 1996 particularly in the tropical rain forest at Serule and Isaq. Data of the flora and fauna were collected through flora inventory, quantitative vegetation analysis, and interview with local people. Population sizes of many animals species appear to be declining and also some endangered species e.g. Panthera tigris sumatrana and Hylobates spp. LI HP also has species of plants are very important from the conservation point of view in relation with the forest concession activities e.g. Toona sureni, Acer laurinum, Intsia palembanica, and Doritis pulcherrima. One alternative to conserve this forest is to develop a buffer zone of medicinal plant estate. Plantations of species traditionally used for medicine, food, timber or other uses could be established in collaboration with industry

AB  - The paper summarized the results of an enquiry concerning the firewood consumption of the people living in buffer zone of Babe National Park. The enquiry were made in the years 2002 - 2003 with financial assistance of International Foundation for Science. Khangninh is a commune where the most part of the people living in is from Dzao ethnic minority. Harvesting firewood was one of the reasons for deforestation in this region. This inquiry is aiming to establish scientific base for the solutions to forest resource conservation. The inquiry results showed that 83.1 percent of firewood are collected in natural forest, including big sized timber with diameter over 20 cm (2.8 percent), small sized timber with diameter 7-20 cm (27 percent), shrub (53.3 percent). The remained part of firewood come from home garden including twig (16.9 percent) and agricultural residues. The firewood is mainly used for food cooking: 27.2 percent, husbandry: 30.2 percent, alcohol distillery: 23.4 percent, heating: 17.6 percent, for sale: 1.7 percent of total consumed firewood. The need for energy is varied depending upon living conditions: The firewood consumption per capita of the dwellers in high mountain: 5.2 kg/day but in the low area it is reduced to 3.5 kg/day.

AB  - The effectiveness of yellow pan traps for investigation of Cerambycidae population in oak canopies was examined. The traps located in the canopies collected 23 species of Cerambycidae, mainly flower visiting species in the subfamilies Lepturinae and Cerambycinae. Some species (i.e. Cortodera humeralis, Grammoptera ustulata, Phymatodes rufipes) were collected only in the traps, whereas others (Anoplodera sexguttata, A. rufipes, Alosterna. tabacicolor and Stenurella nigra) which were frequently observed on the ground of the forest, were collected in the traps only sporadically. Investigations with yellow pan traps were made in one season in two types of forest: managed and treated with insecticides against oak defoliators and in a managed protected buffer zone of reserve. A possible negative effect of treatments was detected only on C. humeralis. Apart from species collected during the experiment with yellow traps an additional 9 species of Cerambycidae were reared or collected in the same area between 2006-2009.

AB  - Biotic agents driven spruce decline has been observed over several regions in Europe. We studied the spatial pattern of spruce stands mortality due to biotic agents in three spruce dominated regions in Slovakia - the Kysuce, Orava and Low Tatras regions. Regularly reported data on sanitary felling were used for the analysis. Geostatistical techniques and other spatial modelling tools were used to design the zones of biotic hazard for each region. Zone A stands for the totally disintegrated stands with extremely elevated activity of biotic agents. Zone B represents the buffer zone around the zone A. Its width depends on the spreading potential of biotic agents and related stand mortality observed during the last years. Zone C stands for the background areas, with more or less healthy stands. Zone-specific forest protection measures are proposed. Such a system allows for the priority rating of unnatural spruce stand conversion and optimal allocation of forest protection measures.

AB  - Long-term data on annual phosphorus (P) transfers from an intensively under-drained largely arable catchment (Rosemaund) and a less intensively drained mixed arable/dairy catchment (Cliftonthorpe) are presented and compared. The range in stream loads of total P (TP) from both catchments was very similar (0.1-4.2 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) and dominated by the particulate (PP) form. At Rosemaund, the majority (approx. 55%) of the P was transferred through pipe drains. The PP transfers in overland flow from arable fields at Rosemaund were estimated to be three times those from extensive grassland and the contribution of hopyards was over 10 times that of arable land. Changing land use from arable to grass at Rosemaund reduced flow and P loss through pipe drains, especially in the third year after establishment. By contrast, at Cliftonthorpe, only 33% of the TP transfer was through pipe drains and PP transfers in overland flow from grassland were estimated to be twice that from arable land. The increased P transfer from grassland was related to livestock poaching mobilizing P on wet riparian fields. However, establishment of a 6-m riparian grass buffer strip at Cliftonthorpe had no beneficial effect on TP transfer over a 3-year period and tended to increase the proportion of P transferred in soluble form. Our data highlight the large variability in P loss risk due to land management rather than land use per se, and the potential for PP transfer to occur from grassland as well as from arable land. More long-term research is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of control options in catchments.

AB  - Ground water and surface water interactions are of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical processes governing phosphorus (P) dynamics in riparian buffers. The four most important conceptual hydrological pathways for P losses from and P retention in riparian buffers are reviewed in this paper: (i) The diffuse flow path with ground water flow through the riparian aquifer, (ii) the overland flow path across the riparian buffer with water coming from adjacent agricultural fields, (iii) irrigation of the riparian buffer with tile drainage water from agricultural fields where disconnected tile drains irrigate the riparian buffer, and (iv) inundation of the riparian buffer (floodplain) with river water during short or longer periods. We have examined how the different flow paths in the riparian buffer influence P retention mechanisms theoretically and from empirical evidence. The different hydrological flow paths determine where and how water-borne P compounds meet and interact with iron and aluminum oxides or other minerals in the geochemical cycling of P in the complex and dynamic environment that constitutes a riparian buffer. The main physical process in the riparian buffer--sedimentation--is active along several flow paths and may account for P retention rates of up to 128 kg P ha-1 yr-1, while plant uptake may temporarily immobilize up to 15 kg P ha-1 yr-1. Retention of dissolved P in riparian buffers is not as pronounced as retention of particulate P and is often below 0.5 kg P ha-1 yr-1. Several studies show significant release of dissolved P (i.e., up to 8 kg P ha-1 yr-1).

AB  - Studies demonstrating the empirical impact of natural enemies on pests and the effect of habitat manipulation are required if farmers are to be persuaded to adopt conservation biocontrol. The relative abundance of different natural enemy guilds were manipulated to investigate their impact on grain aphids (Sitobion avenae) and whether the establishment of wider field margins increased levels of control. The impact of epigeal and flying aphid predators, in isolation and together, on cereal aphids was tested in five fields with standard field margins (ca. 2 m wide) and in five fields with wide margins (ca. 6 m wide). Flying predators alone were as effective as all predators in controlling the grain aphid and reduced aphids by 90% and 93%, whereas epigeal predators alone achieved a reduction of only 40% and 18% in fields with standard and wide margins respectively. Levels of parasitism measured by counts of aphid mummies were relatively low (12%) on all sampling occasions. There was no evidence that the wide field margins increased natural enemies within the adjacent field as measured using pitfall traps, suction sampling and sticky traps. The wide field margins were considered to have no benefit for biocontrol because flying predators capable of moving between fields were primarily responsible or the amount of uncropped land suitable for natural enemies was not a limiting factor in the landscape.

AB  - Capsule Birds using a shooting-free area are markedly influenced by close-by shooting.Aims To examine changes in distribution, feeding ecology and food supply of Common Coots before and after the beginning of hunting on adjacent salt marshes.Methods Common Coots were counted and mapped in October and November, i.e. before and after the start of hunting. In both months, activity budgets for the Coots were determined. To quantify the food supply, macrophyte biomass samples and depth measures were taken along four parallel transects in the areas used by the birds for foraging.Results Before the start of hunting in October, 45% of all Coots were observed within 400 m of the hunting area. In November (when hunting had started) the birds redistributed themselves away from the hunting area, reducing the number of birds within 400 m to 5%. Because of this redistribution, Coots were observed in deeper-water areas of the lagoon during November compared to October, and foraging by diving increased significantly from 14 to 35%. The average biomass of submerged macrophytes in the lagoon was 155.01 g dry weight/m², which corresponds to a total of 302 250 kg in the whole lagoon. The food requirement of each Coot is 52.3 g/day, which is equivalent to 104 kg/day for the autumn peak number at this lagoon (1989 Coots).Conclusion Hunting disturbance outside the shooting-free area displaced Coots from their preferred feeding grounds inside the reserve, causing their redistribution into sub-optimal habitat at greater water depths where Coot feeding costs were higher. Submerged macrophyte biomass showed that food was abundant in the area and therefore unlikely to be a limiting factor that influenced the redistribution of Coots during the shooting season. We suggest that at this particular site the feeding ecology of Coots could be improved by incorporating an appropriate buffer zone between the protected area and the hunted area. This may be of value not only to Coots, but also for other bird species that exploit shallow water.

AB  - The distributions of freshwater mussels are controlled by landscape factors operating at multiple spatial scales. Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) have been implicated in severe population declines and range contractions of freshwater mussels across North America. Despite widespread recognition of multiscale influences few studies have addressed these issues when developing distribution models. Furthermore, most studies have disregarded the role of landscape pattern in regulating aquatic species distributions, focusing only on landscape composition. In this study, the distribution of Rabbitsfoot (Quadrula cylindrica) in the upper Green River system (Ohio River drainage) is modeled with environmental variables from multiple scales: subcatchment, riparian buffer, and reach buffer. Four types of landscape environment metrics are used, including: LULC pattern, LULC composition, soil composition, and geology composition. The study shows that LULC pattern metrics are very useful in modeling the distribution of Rabbitsfoot. Together with LULC compositional metrics, pattern metrics permit a more detailed analysis of functional linkages between aquatic species distributions and landscape structure. Moreover, the inclusion of multiple spatial scales is necessary to accurately model the hierarchical processes in stream systems. Geomorphic features play important roles in regulating species distributions at intermediate and large scales while LULC variables appear more influential at proximal scales.

AB  - Plant species composition and species number were studied in two types of field margins: 31 arable field margins and 33 road verges. Both field margin types were adjacent to intensively managed grass or cereal fields. Effects of eight variables on field margin vegetation were studied. Despite having many plant species in common, composition and species number differed between the two field margin types, due to different ecological conditions and margin management. Arable field margins were composed of tall and/or nutrient demanding ubiquitous species and were characterised by species of later successional stages than those of road verges. The vegetation of road verges was lower and species numbers were higher than in arable field margins. The road verges contained several semi-natural meadow species that are declining in abundance. A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded variables showed that plant species composition was significantly affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent to fields with mainly cereal crops. In order to preserve botanical diversity in this agricultural landscape, the maintenance of regularly mown road verges should be prioritized.

AB  - Spatial variations in the N₂O emissions and denitrification potential of riparian buffer strips (RBS) in a polluted river were examined. The river received large pollutant inputs from urban runoff and wastewater discharge, resulting in impaired water quality in the river and downstream reservoir. The potential for nitrogen removal by RBS was evaluated by measuring in situ N₂O emission fluxes in static closed chambers and sediment denitrification potentials with acetylene inhibition techniques. The results showed that N₂O emission fluxes decreased from the upstream (16.39 μg/(m²·h)) to downstream (0.30 μg/(m²·h)) sites and from the water body to upland sites. The trend in decreasing N₂O emission fluxes in the downstream direction was mainly associated with sediment/soil textures (clay loam→sandy soil) and sediment/soil water contents and was also related to the vegetation along the RBS and nutrients in the sediments/soils. The correlation coefficient was highest (r=0.769) between the N₂O emission flux and sediment/soil water content. Sediment/soil denitrification potentials under N-amended and ambient conditions were higher (highest 32.86 mg/(kg·h)) for the upstream sites, which were consistent with in situ N₂O flux rates.

AB  - Recent attention has focused on riparian forest buffer systems for filtering sediment, nutrients, and pesticides entering from upslope agricultural fields. Studies in a variety of physiographic areas have shown that concentrations of sediment and agrichemicals are reduced after passage through a riparian forest. The mechanisms involved are both physical and biological, including deposition, uptake by vegetation, and loss by microbiological processes such as denitrification. Current research by USDA-ARS and University of Georgia scientists at Tifton, GA is focusing on managing riparian forest buffer systems to alleviate agricultural impacts on the environment. The underlying concept for this research is that agricultural impact on streams is best protected by a riparian forest buffer system consisting of three zones. In consecutive upslope order from the stream these zones are (1) a narrow band of permanent trees (5-10 m wide) immediately adjacent to the stream channel which provides streambank stabilization, organic debris input to streams, and shading of streams, (2) a forest management zone where maximum biomass production is stressed and frees can be harvested, and (3) a grass buffer strip up to 10 m wide to provide control of coarse sediment and to spread overland flow. Several ongoing projects at Tifton, GA are focusing on using riparian forest buffer systems as filters. A forest management project is testing the effects of different management practices on surface and ground water quality. This project includes three different forest management practices: mature forest, selectively thinned forest, and clearcut. In a different study a natural wetland is being restored by planting frees. The effectiveness of this wetland on filtering nutrients from dairy wastes which are being applied upslope is being evaluated. At this same site, a pesticide study is being conducted on the side opposite to where dairy wastes are applied. An overland flow-riparian buffer system using swine lagoon waste is evaluating the effectiveness of different vegetative treatments and lengths of buffer zones on filtering of nutrients. In this study three vegetative treatments are compared: (1) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m riparian forest, (2) 20 m grass buffer and 10 m riparian forest, (3) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m of the recommended wetland species maidencane. Waste is applied at the upper end of each plot at either a high or low rate, and then allowed to flow downslope. The three zone riparian forest buffer system is being used for the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM). This model, which is currently under development at Tifton, GA, is a computer simulation model designed to reduce soil and water degradation by aiding farmers and land use managers in decision making regarding how best to utilize their riparian buffer system. Both information currently being collected in field studies and development of the REMM are innovative farm-level and forestry technologies to protect soil and water resources.

AB  - A three-year study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using riparian buffer systems to assimilate nitrogen (N) from swine lagoon effluent. Replicated 30X4 m plots were established at the interface of a pasture and riparian forest. Wastewater from the third lagoon of the University of Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station main swine research unit was applied to each plot by overland flow from tanks at the top end of each plot. The wastewater, which contained an average N concentration of 160 mg L-1 N, primarily as ammonium (NH4-N), was applied to the plots at three different rates (either once per week [1X, 1285 L/plot] or twice per week [2X, 2570 L/plot]). Three different vegetative buffer treatments were evaluated: (1) 10 m grass buffer draining into 20 m existing riparian zone vegetation; (2) 20 m grass buffer draining into 10 m existing riparian zone vegetation; and (3) 10 m grass buffer draining into 20 m maidencane (Panicum hematomon). The effects of the wastewater on surface runoff and groundwater quality were evaluated by transects of surface runoff collectors, suction lysimeters, and shallow groundwater wells which extended from the top to the bottom of each plot. Data analyses showed differences due to wastewater application rate and distance downslope from the wastewater application pipe. Nitrogen concentrations increased over time at the top ends of the plots but showed little increase at the bottom ends of the plots. Overall, all three vegetative treatments were successful in assimilating N from the wastewater. The study showed that riparian buffer systems, where wastewater is applied by overland flow, can be effective in assimilating N contained within lagooned animal wastes.

AB  - A study was conducted to determine the impact of different forest management techniques on shallow groundwater quality in coastal plain riparian zones. Considerable past research had shown that riparian zones are effective in removing or assimilating nitrates entering from upslope agricultural fields via shallow lateral flow, but the impact of different forest management techniques on this process was unknown. The study was conducted at a site near Tifton, Georgia, on a second-order coastal plain stream. The riparian buffer system consisted of a grass buffer, a managed forest zone, and a forest zone adjacent to the stream. Three forest treatments were studied: mature forest (MF), clearcut (CC), and selective thinning (ST). Following a nine-month pretreatment period, trees were completely or selectively removed from the CC and ST treatments, respectively. Shallow groundwater quality was evaluated in networks of wells on transects extending downslope from the edge of the agricultural field to the stream. Results from the study showed that all three forest management treatments were effective in assimilating nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). Significant differences in NO3-N concentrations in the shallow groundwater between the three different treatments did not occur. The only statistically significant effect that was observed on groundwater quality was under the CC treatment, where solute concentrations (both NO3-N and chloride [Cl]) decreased after the tree cutting. This was attributed to a combination of effects including possible increased NO3-N uptake by rapidly growing vegetation, dilution associated with less evapotranspiration by young vegetation as compared to mature forest, and more throughfall of rainfall under the CC than under the other two treatments. No treatment effects were observed on ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) concentrations. Overall the study showed that regardless of forest management techniques, coastal plain riparian forests are effective in assimilating

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of contaminant source width on the detection efficiency of five, six, and seven well monitoring networks for a range of groundwater seepage velocities. Wells were positioned downgradient of a rectangular landfill oriented obliquely to groundwater flow. A buffer zone boundary, establishing a distance limit within which contaminant plumes should be detected, was located 100 m from the landfill's downgradient corner. Various combinations of seepage velocity, from 0.01 to 10.0 m/d, and contaminant source width, from 0.1 to 5.0 m, were input to a computer model, which computed the detection capability of alternative monitoring networks. Smaller networks were more sensitive to changes in contaminant source width and seepage velocity. The smallest network showed a 21.6% greater range in detection efficiency than the largest network over the range of input values. Each network was considerably more sensitive to contaminant source width than seepage velocity, suggesting uncertainty in contaminant source width warrants attention in field applications. The type of analysis illustrated in this study may be useful for identifying appropriate monitoring networks given uncertainty in contaminant source width and seepage velocity at field settings.

AB  - In the regions where agriculture covers most of the landscape, species rich field margins have an important role in the preservation of biodiversity, plants and fauna. Considering this, the Swiss Confederation plans to introduce «field margins» as new type of ecological compensation area. It is a perennial and linear structure sown with a mixture of native forbs and grasses. It is 3 to 12 meters width and is made to endure throughout the years without reseeding. To determine the effect of this new structure on Vole and Mole populations, 36 agricultural fields were studied with either an improved field margin, a usual field margin or a wild flower strip on the edge. The results show that these three types of field edges are appreciated by voles, but their activity inside the field stay low, whatever the edge type. Not a single Mole has been observed during this study.

AB  - The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) herbicide resistant oilseed rape (Brassica napus) has increased over the past few years. The transfer of herbicide resistance genes via pollen (gene flow) from GM crops to non-GM crops is of relevance for the realisation of co-existence of different agricultural cultivation forms as well as for weed management. Therefore the likelihood of pollen-mediated gene flow has been investigated in numerous studies. Despite the difficulty to compare different experiments with varying levels of outcrossing, we performed a literature search for world-wide studies on cross-fertilisation in fully fertile oilseed rape. The occurrence and frequency of pollen-mediated intraspecific gene flow (outcrossing rate) can vary according to cultivar, experimental design, local topography and environmental conditions. The outcrossing rate from one field to another depends also on the size and arrangement of donor and recipient populations and on the ratio between donor and recipient plot size. The outcrossing levels specified in the presented studies are derived mostly from experiments where the recipient field is either surrounding the donor field (continuous design) or is located as a patch at different distances from the donor field (discontinuous design). Reports of gene flow in Brassica napus generally show that the amount of cross-fertilisation decreases as the distance from the pollen source increases. The evidence given in various studies reveals that the bulk of GM cross-fertilisation occurs within the first 10 m of the recipient field. The removal of the first 10 m of a non-transgenic field facing a GM crop might therefore be more efficient for reducing the total level of cross-fertilisation in a recipient sink population than to recommend separation distances. Future experiments should investigate cross-fertilisation with multiple adjacent donor fields at the landscape level under different spatial distributions of rapeseed cultivars and different cropping systems. The level of cross-fertilisation occurring over the whole field is mainly important for co-existence and has not been investigated in agricultural scale experiments until now. Potential problems with herbicide resistant oilseed rape volunteers arising from intraspecific gene flow can be largely solved by the choice of suitable cultivars and herbicides as well as by soil management.

AB  - Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts can be transported in overland flow from faecal deposits of grazing animals causing potential water contamination problems. Deposition of oocysts can occur when overland flow encounters vegetative buffers and its transport capacity is decreased in the upslope backwater region. Deposition of oocysts was investigated using a large rainfall simulator, with and without a vetiver buffer strip. Oocysts-spiked slurries were applied to two contrasting soils and the resultant oocyst/sediment depositions from the flow were compared. The buffers substantially reduced suspended sediment loads from the two soils and increased the oocyst concentration in the soil with >99% of the deposited oocysts measured upslope of the buffer.

AB  - Vegetated buffer strips are widely used to reduce fluxes of eroding soil and associated chemicals, from hillslopes into waterways. Sediment retention by buffers is time-dependent, with its effectiveness changing with the deposition process. Our research focuses on settling of sediment upslope of stiff grass buffers at three slopes, under subcritical flow conditions. A new model is developed which couples the hydraulics, sediment deposition and subsequent adjustment to topography in order to predict water and sediment profiles upslope of a buffer with time. Experiments to test the model were carried out in the Griffith University Tilting-Flume Simulated Rainfall facility using subcritical flows at 1%, 3% and 5% slopes. Water and sediment profiles were measured at different times as Vertisol sediment was introduced upslope of a vetiver grass strip. A region of increased flow depth (backwater) was produced upslope of the strip which increased in depth and decreased in length with increasing slope. Backwater height could be predicted from flow rates and thus could be used as an input for the model in the absence of experimental data. As slope increased, sediment was deposited closer to the grass strip, moving into the grass strip itself at 5% slope. The grass strip was less effective in reducing sediment in the outflow as slope increased and differences between slopes were significant. Model prediction of water and sediment profiles compared reasonably well with measured data, giving low root mean square errors and high coefficients of model efficiency. Masses of deposited sediment were generally simulated within 20% of measured values. However, simulated particle size distributions of deposited sediment were less accurate.

AB  - Eutrophication of surface waters accelerated by nutrient runoff from agriculture is a growing concern in developed countries. Controlling the loss of phosphorus is complicated, among other things, due to its intertemporal nature. Phosphorus fertilisation affects crop yields and phosphorus losses mainly via the potentially plant available of soil phosphorus reserves whose development is very slow. Hence, both privately and socially optimal choices of phosphorus are results of a dynamic decision making process. On the other hand, phosphorus loss is comprised of various phosphorus forms, differing in their contribution to eutrophication and in their sensitivity towards various phosphorus control measures. These forms can be roughly divided into particulate phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus. The former can be controlled mainly by controlling the soil erosion, the latter by controlling the potentially plant available soil phosphorus reserves. In this study, we solve analytically the privately and socially optimal steady state fertilisation levels and vegetative filter strip allocations, and design and analyse alternative instruments to sustain these allocations. We conduct an empirical application for an agricultural area of 37 parcels of one hectare, varying in their slopes and shapes. We find that the first-best taxes can be equivalently base on fertilisation or on soil phosphorus, but basing them directly on soil phosphorus might reduce the information burden of the regulator. We also find that the vegetative filter strip allocations are strongly differentiated, and that the second-best vegetative filter strip subsidies can be relatively easily be adjusted to sustain almost the first-best allocations.

AB  - The present research investigated the relationship between nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in river water and the land use/land cover (hereafter, land use) in the Teshio River watershed located in northern Hokkaido island to understand the effect of human activities such as agriculture, forestry, industry, and urbanization in the drainage basin on the river ecosystem quality and services. River water was sampled at nine points seasonally during a two-year period and the nutrients concentration was measured. Land use profiles were estimated at two spatial scales-riparian and sub-catchment for each sampling station. The spatial pattern of water quality in the Teshio River showed increased NO3-N levels associated with agriculture and urban expansion, and forest reduction in the watershed. Land use at the riparian scale closely reflected that at the sub-catchment scale, which masked the unique riparian buffer effect on the river water condition. The high agricultural and reduced forest area in the riparian zone, especially in the upper middle reach, could be a possible reason for a decline of ecosystem service for the provisioning of clean water and habitat for aquatic organisms. Measures towards sustainable and more nature-friendly agricultural management are necessary in the area to protect the Teshio River ecosystem and its ecosystem services.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of Turkey’s important environmental problems of today as it has impacted negatively on public health. This paper analyses the extent of noise levels emitted by public ferries at the Çanakkale port, Dardanelles.   Measurements were taken 4 times a day in for a whole week with 5 hour intervals from 8.00 in the morning to 23.00 in the evening. It was found that the maximum noise level was 89.4 dB in a one-day measurement, while the minimum noise levels 60.0 dB. Similar results were obtained for the whole week of measurement where the maximum noise level was 91,1 dB and the minimum 60,1 dB . This gave an average weekly value of around 75 dB which was clearly higher than the EPA mean value of 70dB, and denoting the potential ill effect of noise pollution by ferry traffics in Dardanelles. This means that mitigating measures should be enhanced, some of which include diversion of the ferries away from the main port, use of noise reduction gears by vessels, the creation of vegetative buffer zone within the port vicinity, prohibition of horning by vessels, and stringent enforcement of the noise control laws.

AB  - The Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix L.), listed in Annex 1 of the European Bird Directive, inhabits the vulnerable alpine treeline ecotone. Reacting sensitively to modifications of the environment, it can be regarded as an indicator species. To assess summer habitat use, we measured habitat parameters and recorded faeces (intestinal droppings) of Black Grouse on a mountain chain of the Northern Limestone Alps at the northern fringe of its distribution. In the area, the existing hiking trails are frequently used by hikers in summer. We modelled summer habitat use and included effects of hiking trails testing three different buffer radii around hiking trails (i.e., 50, 100 and 150� m); the buffer radius of 50� m significantly contributed to the final model of habitat use. Altitude, cover of grasses/herbs, canopy cover of woody plants <5� m, canopy cover of woody plants ≥5� m, grazing intensity, and the interaction term cover of grasses/herbs� ×� canopy cover of woody plants ≥5� m combined with presence–absence of hiking trails best predicted the occurrence of Black Grouse. Our calculations yielded lower probabilities of Black Grouse occurrence areas adjacent to hiking trails (odds of presence reduced by 93� %). Terrestrial mapping of indirect signs and the statistical model were appropriate to depict significant differences of probabilities of occurrence within and outside the buffer zone around hiking trails. Considering the habitat variables in the model, enhancing small-scale habitat heterogeneity seems to be a recommendable habitat management strategy; by creating a fine mosaic of higher woody plants, dwarf shrubs and open, grassy habitat patches, a rich supply of food and cover can be provided within short distances.

AB  - Rainfall simulation was used to study the vegetative filter strip (VFS) conditions under which losses of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) leaching occur. Boxes containing silt loam soil were planted with ryegrass and cut at two different intervals prior to simulated rainfall 14 days apart. Grass clippings were either removed or retained. During the second simulated rainfall, runoff TDP and DRP were greater for treatments cut the day before irrigation with clippings retained as compared to treatments cut the same day as irrigation with clippings retained. Removing clippings yielded the lowest mean TDP and DRP concentrations. Increasing the senesced vegetative surface area for contact with water, and the amount of time for leaching to occur, resulted in the greatest DRP loss. The VFS management implications should consider clipping removal or no or reduced mowing during the growing season followed by end-of-season removal to reduce DRP leaching losses.

AB  - Graphical models provide an important tool for facilitating communication between scientists, decision-makers, and statisticians—many complicated ecological processes can be described in terms of “box-and-arrow” conceptual diagrams (e.g., Shipley in Cause and correlation in biology: a user’s guide to path analysis, structural equations and causal inferences, Cambridge Universtiy Press, Cambridge, 2000; Clark and Gelfand TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution 21:375–380, 2006). In particular, problems in landscape ecology often involve modeling relationships among multiple physical and/or biological variables that may operate on differing spatial scales (e.g., Rossi et al. in Ecol Monographs 62:277–314, 1992; Legendre et al. in Ecography 25:601–615, 2002; Overmars et al. in Ecol Model 164:257–270, 2003; Brown and Spector in J Appl Ecol 45:1639–1648, 2008; Koniak and Noy-Meir in Ecol Model 220:1148–1158, 2008). These problems are inherently multivariate, though researchers commonly rely on univariate methods, such as spatial regression models, to address them. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate method—graphical spatial models—that extends path analysis to incorporate spatial autocorrelation in one or more variables in a directed graph. We show how both exogenous and endogenous ecological processes as defined by Legendre et al. (Ecography 25:601–615, 2002) and Lichstein et al. (Ecol Monographs 72:445–463, 2002) can be represented in a graph. Most importantly, we show how to translate graphs representing these ecological processes into statistically estimable models. We motivate our theoretical results using an example of stream health data from the Willamette Valley, Oregon. For these data we are interested in the spatial pattern within both riparian land use and an index of stream health, and whether there is an association between land use and stream health, after accounting for these spatial patterns. We use a graphical spatial model to address these ecological questions simultaneously. We find that the health of a stream decreases as the percent of developed land within a 120-m riparian buffer increases; interestingly, there is only evidence of spatial pattern within land use.

AB  - African animal trypanosomosis is a major obstacle to the development ofmore efficient and sustainable livestock production systems in West Africa. Riverine tsetse species such as Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank are their major vectors. A wide variety of control tactics is available to manage these vectors, but their elimination will only be sustainable if control is exercised following area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) principles, i.e. the control effort is targeting an entire tsetse population within a circumscribed area. In the present study, genetic variation at microsatellite DNA loci was used to examine the population structure of G. p. gambiensis inhabiting two adjacent river basins, i.e. the Comoe´ and the Mouhoun River basins in Burkina Faso. A remote sensing analysis revealed that the woodland savannah habitats between the river basins have remained unchanged during the last two decades. In addition, genetic variation was studied in two populations that were separated by a manmade lake originating from a dam built in 1991 on the Comoe´ . Low genetic differentiation was observed between the samples from the Mouhoun and the Comoe´ River basins and no differentiation was found between the samples separated by the dam. The data presented indicate that the overall genetic differentiation of G. p. gambiensis populations inhabiting two adjacent river basins in Burkina Faso is low (FST = 0.016). The results of this study suggest that either G. p. gambiensis populations from the Mouhoun are not isolated from those of the Comoe´ , or that the isolation is too recent to be detected. If elimination of the G. p. gambiensis population from the Mouhoun River basin is the selected control strategy, reinvasion from adjacent river basins may need to be prevented by establishing a buffer zone between the Mouhoun and the other river basin(s).

Une partie de ces eaux est piegee par infiltration dans la bande herbeuse. L' objectif de l' etude est de suivre le devenir et d' evaluer le lessivage de l' atrazine et de la deethylatrazine (DEA) transportees dans les eaux de ruissellement et piegees dans une bande herbeuse installee en bas d' une parcelle en pente cultivee en mais. La solution du sol est echantillonnee a deux profondeurs a l' aide de bougies poreuses, le lessivage des produits est estime a partir du drainage calcule par un modele de bilan hydrique au champ. Les resultats montrent que l' atrazine et la DEA transportees par les eaux de ruissellement migrent dans la bande herbeuse par des transferts preferentiels a une profondeur d' au moins 60 cm en 1997 et 1999 sans parvenir a 120 cm. En 1998, la descente des pesticides n' atteint pas 60 cm. La profondeur de migration depend de l' etat hydrique du sol au moment des evenements pluvieux. La persistance de la DEA dans l' eau du sol est plus longue que celle de l' atrazine, ces produits se dissipent plus lentement en profondeur. L' attenuation des concentrations en atrazine a 60 cm de profondeur par rapport a celles des eaux de ruissellement varie de 60 a 95 /, selon les annees et la place de la bougie poreuse par rapport aux voies d' ecoulement. Les transferts sont limites aux quelques semaines qui suivent les traitements alors que le lessivage de la DEA et de l' atrazine intervient principalement pendant la periode d' arret de la vegetation. Dans les conditions climatiques de cette etude, le lessivage calcule de la DEA est deux fois celui de l' atrazine.

AB  - In the regions where agriculture covers most of the landscape, species rich field margins have an important role in the preservation of biodiversity, plants and fauna. Considering this, the Swiss Confederation plans to introduce "field margins" as new type of ecological compensation area. It is a perennial and linear structure sown with a mixture of native forbs and grasses. It is 3 to 12 meters wide and is made to endure throughout the years without reseeding. To determine the effect of this new structure on vole and mole populations, we studied 36 agricultural fields with either an improved field margin or a conventional field margin or a wildflower strip on the edge. The results show that these three types of field edges are appreciated by voles, but the activity of those rodents inside the field stay low, whatever the edge type. Not a single mole has been observed during this study.

AB  - An inventory of medicinal plants was conducted in the forest of Bitakol, the bufferzone of the Baluran National Park, East Java, in June 1989. It was found that medicinal plants consisted about 66 percent of the undergrowths in the forest area. Some medicinal plants were quite abundant, like Schleichera oleosa (kesambi), Uvaria rufa (kalak), and Helicteres isora (ole). A few important medicinal plant species were hardly found i.e, Aegle marmerlos (maja), Parkia (kedawung) and Cassia fistula (trengguli). Traditional therapeutics commonly practised by local people included the application of Bridelia monoica (tanglo) for itching, Aegle marmelos for internal disease and Parkia javanica for flatulence.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate sediment yield reduction under various field slope conditions with rice straw mat. The Vegetative Filter Strip Model-W (VFSMOD-W) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used for simulation of sediment yield reduction effect of rice straw mat. The Universe Soil Loss Equation Practice factor (USLE P factor), being able to reflect simulation of rice straw mat in the agricultural field, were estimated for each slope with VFSMOD-W and measured soil erosion values under 5, 10, and 20 % slopes. Then with the regression equation for slopes, USLE P factor was derived and used as input data for each Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) in the SWAT model. The SWAT Spatially Distributed-HRU (SD-HRU) pre-processor module was utilized, moreover, in order to consider spatial location and topographic features (measured topographic features by field survey) of all HRU within each subwatershed in the study watershed. Result of monthly sediment yield without rice straw mat (Jan. 2000 - Aug. 2007) was 814.72 ton/month, and with rice straw mat (Jan. 2000 - Aug. 2007) was 526.75 ton/month, which was reduced as 35.35 % compared without it. Also, during the rainy season (from Jun. to Sep. 2000 - 2007), when without vs. with rice straw mat, monthly sediment indicated 2,109.54 ton and 1,358.61 ton respectively. It showed about 35.60 % was reduced depending on rice straw mat. As shown in this study, if rice straw mat is used as a Best Management Practice (BMP) in the sloping fields, rainfall-driven sediment yield will be reduced effectively.

AB  - Scots pine seed orchards secure physiologically and genetically valuable seed supply for forest nurseries and are the way to implement results of tree breeding work in praxis. Analyzed material consists of 10 progeny trials, 25-35 years old that together contains 363 plus-tree and clone open pollinated progeny families. Best families have been selected with growth potential indicator: yield of dominant trees. This trait in family mean level is less dependent from number of trees (per family) than total yield (standing volume) or dominant tree height (r**2=0,16, r=0,73 un r=0,24 respectively) and have almost no correlations with quality traits (r is less than 0,2). Selected 50 best families have 27% higher yield of dominant trees, compare to control (forest stand progenies). At the same time selected material have 3% lower maximal branch diameter, 5% lower average branch diameter (evaluated in grades) and 2% straighter stems (evaluated in grades) as control lots. We recommend, establishing the 2nd stage seed orchard, to develop few rows buffer zone from early flowering clone with a high breeding value and high male flowering intensity as well as to use the clones with possible synchronous flowering time to reduce pollen contamination in pollination of plantation clones. It is necessary to chose number of ramets per clone proportional to its breeding value - for the analyzed material in this way it was possible to increase genetic gain by 5%, while keeping constant genetic diversity (effective number of clones 22). It is suggested to use effective number of clones in seed orchards with tested clones 20-25.

AB  - To increase the food production in Lampung Province, Way Rarem irrigation project was developed to irrigate about 22.000 hectares of rice fields. The research purposes are to know the functions of Way Rarem both in irrigation and tourism development, and to study the impact of the management of buffer zone environment towards the Way Rarem reservoir and to study the impact of the Way Rarem reservoir towards the social culture in the community around it. The results of the research show that the Way Rarem reservoir does not optimally function both on the irrigation and the tourism development area. This is caused by the social cultural condition of the community around it who does not fully support the maintenance and existence of the reservoir

AB  - Efficiency of non‐point source pollution control methods may be altered in future climate. This study investigated climate change impacts on sediment and nutrient transport, and efficiency of best management practices (BMPs), in the Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) in Mississippi. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was applied to the UPRW using observed flow, sediment and nutrient data. Water quality samples were collected at three US geological survey gauging stations. The model was successfully calibrated and validated for daily time steps (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination – R² up to 0.7) using manual and automatic (sequential uncertainty fitting version 2) methods from February 2010 to May 2011. Future weather scenarios were simulated using the LARS‐WG model, a stochastic weather generator, with Community Climate System Model, global climate model, which was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA. On the basis of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B, A2 and B1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change scenarios were simulated for the mid (2046–2065) and late (2080–2099) century. Effectiveness of four BMPs (Riparian buffer, stream fencing, sub‐surface manure applications and vegetative filter strips) on reducing sediment and nutrient were evaluated in current and future climate conditions. Results show that sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings will be increased up to a maximum of 26.3%, 7.3% and 14.3%, respectively, in future climate conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of BMPs on sediment removal will be reduced in future climate conditions, and the efficiency of nitrogen removal will be increased, whereas phosphorus removal efficiency will remain unchanged.

AB  - Riparian buffers are a proven practice for removing NO3 from overland flow and shallow groundwater. However, in landscapes with artificial subsurface (tile) drainage, most of the subsurface flow leaving fields is passed through the buffers in drainage pipes, leaving little opportunity for NO3 removal. We investigated the feasibility of re-routing a fraction of field tile drainage as subsurface flow through a riparian buffer for increasing NO3 removal. We intercepted an existing field tile outlet draining a 10.1-ha area of a row-cropped field in central Iowa and re-routed a fraction of the discharge as subsurface flow along 335 m of an existing riparian buffer. Tile drainage from the field was infiltrated through a perforated pipe installed 75 cm below the surface by maintaining a constant head in the pipe at a control box installed in-line with the existing field outlet. During 2 yr, >18,000 m3 (55%) of the total flow from the tile outlet was redirected as infiltration within the riparian buffer. The redirected water seeped through the 60-m-wide buffer, raising the water table approximately 35 cm. The redirected tile flow contained 228 kg of NO3. On the basis of the strong decrease in NO3 concentrations within the shallow groundwater across the buffer, we hypothesize that the NO3 did not enter the stream but was removed within the buffer by plant uptake, microbial immobilization, or denitrification. Redirecting tile drainage as subsurface flow through a riparian buffer increased its NO3 removal benefit and is a promising management practice to improve surface water quality within tile-drained landscapes.

AB  - Five terrestrial liming strategies are compared in forested and moorland subcatchments monitored under the Llyn Brianne Acid Waters Project in Wales. Lime was applied to a moorland whole catchment, to a forested and to a moorland water source area, to a forest buffer zone and to a hillslope within a moorland catchment. In terms of the long-term behaviour of stream chemistry, in particular calcium, pH and aluminum, at each site, addition of limestone to hydrological source areas has raised stream chemistry above proposed biological thresholds in the long term and has changed, chemically, the short-term storm event response in these catchments significantly. Buffer zone liming and standard agricultural improvement have not affected streamwater chemistry.

AB  - Climate change may have profound effects on phosphorus (P) transport in streams and on lake eutrophication. Phosphorus loading from land to streams is expected to increase in northern temperate coastal regions due to higher winter rainfall and to a decline in warm temperate and arid climates. Model results suggest a 3.3 to 16.5% increase within the next 100 yr in the P loading of Danish streams depending on soil type and region. In lakes, higher eutrophication can be expected, reinforced by temperature-mediated higher P release from the sediment. Furthermore, a shift in fish community structure toward small and abundant plankti-benthivorous fish enhances predator control of zooplankton, resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. Data from Danish lakes indicate increased chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass, higher dominance of dinophytes and cyanobacteria (most notably of nitrogen fixing forms), but lower abundance of diatoms and chrysophytes, reduced size of copepods and cladocerans, and a tendency to reduced zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio when lakes warm. Higher P concentrations are also seen in warm arid lakes despite reduced external loading due to increased evapotranspiration and reduced inflow. Therefore, the critical loading for good ecological state in lakes has to be lowered in a future warmer climate. This calls for adaptation measures, which in the northern temperate zone should include improved P cycling in agriculture, reduced loading from point sources, and (re)-establishment of wetlands and riparian buffer zones. In the arid Southern Europe, restrictions on human use of water are also needed, not least on irrigation.

AB  - Climate change might have profound effects on the nitrogen (N) dynamics in the cultivated landscape as well as on N transport in streams and the eutrophication of lakes. N loading from land to streams is expected to increase in North European temperate lakes due to higher winter rainfall and changes in cropping patterns. Scenario (IPCC, A2) analyses using a number of models of various complexity for Danish streams and lakes suggest an increase in runoff and N transport on an annual basis (higher during winter and typically lower during summer) in streams, a slight increase in N concentrations in streams despite higher losses in riparian wetlands, higher absolute retention of N in lakes (but not as percentage of loading), but only minor changes in lake water concentrations. However, when taking into account also a predicted higher temperature there is a risk of higher frequency and abundance of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in lakes and they may stay longer during the season. Somewhat higher risk of loss of submerged macrophytes at increased N and phosphorus (P) loading and a shift to dominance of small-sized fish preying upon the key grazers on phytoplankton may also enhance the risk of lake shifts from clear to turbid in a warmer North European temperate climate. However, it must be emphasised that the prediction of N transport and thus effects is uncertain as the prediction of regional precipitation and changes in land-use is uncertain. By contrast, N loading is expected to decline in warm temperate and arid climates. However, in warm arid lakes much higher N concentrations are currently observed despite reduced external loading. This is due to increased evapotranspiration leading to higher nutrient concentrations in the remaining water, but may also reflect a low-oxygen induced reduction of nitrification. Therefore, the critical N as well as P loading for good ecological state in lakes likely has to be lower in a future warmer climate in both north temperate and Mediterranean lakes. To obtain this objective, adaptation measures are required. In both climate zones the obvious methods are to change agricultural practices for reducing the loss of nutrients to surface waters, to improve sewage treatment and to reduce the storm-water nutrient runoff. In north temperate zones adaptations may also include re-establishment of artificial and natural wetlands, introduction of riparian buffer zones and re-meandering of channelised streams, which may all have a large impact on, not least, the N loading of lakes. In the arid zone, also restrictions on human use of water are urgently needed, not least on the quantity of water used for irrigation purposes.

AB  - In 1998, the Slovenian National Plant Protection Organisation implemented a survey of fire  blight caused by Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al., which was first detected in 2001  in Naklo. This was followed by two larger outbreaks in 2003 and in 2007. Findings of the  survey in the period from 2003 to 2008 were crucial for the existing demarcation of specific  areas in compliance with the national legislation and Commission Regulation No 690/2008.   To prevent the spread of the bacterial disease, and to protect orchards and the production of  plants for planting, the Republic of Slovenia was recognised as a Protected Zone for fire  blight which is valid, except for Gorenjska, Mariborska and Notranjska regions, until 31  March 2010. Only the plants which were produced under the same conditions in protected  zones of other member states, or in the buffer zones which are established under specific  conditions within the infected or established region, are allowed to be moved to the protected  zone for fire blight in Slovenia. From 2003 to 2007, the disease spread and settled down in  Gorenjska, Koroska, Notranjska and Maribor region. In 2003, infections in the near vicinity of  production areas of host plants of fire blight intended for planting were detected for the first  time in the Gorenjska region, where the first two buffer zones were established: Sorsko polje  and Volcji potok (Arboretum). In 2008, a new buffer zone was established in Selo in the  Prekmurje region. Buffer zones are established by the Phytosanitary Administration at the  request of producers of the plants or their associations, or ex officio, under the conditions laid  down in the Rules on measures for the prevention of spread and suppression of fire blight.  Compliance with the requirements is checked by the official service. In the establishment and  maintenance of buffer zones, several factors are taken into account: economic interest of the  producer; data on the presence and eradication of Erwinia amylovora in the buffer zone and  it's surrounding; the costs of establishment and maintenance of the area (official inspection,  sampling and ordering measures); market value of the host plants for planting that are  expected to be produced; and environmental aspects and social dimensions.  Regarding the common EU market with free movement of goods, and the spread of fire  blight, it should be considered where the establishment of new, or maintenance of the  established buffer zones would be possible, appropriate and reasonable.

AB  - Wet-dry zone is an area that the flooded land exposed on the water surface periodically with the seasonal water fluctuations in reservoirs. It is a unique phenomenon of reservoir. This article aims to demonstrate and develop the ecological embankment by incorporating ecological elements when designing the wet-dry zone embankment. Take the embankment design of Lake Longevity wet-dry zone as an example, different shore status of fluctuating conditions were analyzed. There were 4 types of embankments: the lawn-type, the rocky beach-type, the stone-type, and the muddy-type. The natural prototype, the nature-type and the artificial-natural type of eco- embankment were carried out by introducing the concept of eco-embankment design according to each different water level conditions. On the basis of ecological priority and people-oriented design principles, the embankment construction mode was soil and water conservation + buffer zone + ecological revetment + lake, which combined with the cultivation of aquatic plants. The essay has come to the conclusion that the construction of wet-dry zone embankment should be satisfy the demand of both man and nature and establish a balanced and dynamic system through the exchange between land and water in accordance with different water levels.

AB  - The introduction of anthropogenic sounds into the marine environment can impact some marine mammals. Impacts can be greatly reduced if appropriate mitigation measures and monitoring are implemented. This paper concerns such measures undertaken by Exxon Neftegas Limited, as operator of the Sakhalin-1 Consortium, during the Odoptu 3-D seismic survey conducted during 17 August-9 September 2001. The key environmental issue was protection of the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), which feeds in summer and fall primarily in the Piltun feeding area off northeast Sakhalin Island. Existing mitigation and monitoring practices for seismic surveys in other jurisdictions were evaluated to identify best practices for reducing impacts on feeding activity by western gray whales. Two buffer zones were established to protect whales from physical injury or undue disturbance during feeding. A 1 km buffer protected all whales from exposure to levels of sound energy potentially capable of producing physical injury. A 4-5 km buffer was established to avoid displacing western gray whales from feeding areas. Trained Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) on the seismic ship Nordic Explorer had the authority to shut down the air guns if whales were sighted within these buffers. Additional mitigation measures were also incorporated: Temporal mitigation was provided by rescheduling the program from June-August to August-September to avoid interference with spring arrival of migrating gray whales. The survey area was reduced by 19% to avoid certain waters <20 m deep where feeding whales concentrated and where seismic acquisition was a lower priority. The number of air guns and total volume of the air guns were reduced by about half (from 28 to 14 air guns and from 3,390 in³ to 1,640 in³) relative to initial plans. “Ramp-up” (=“soft-start”) procedures were implemented. Monitoring activities were conducted as needed to implement some mitigation measures, and to assess residual impacts. Aerial and vessel-based surveys determined the distribution of whales before, during and after the seismic survey. Daily aerial reconnaissance helped verify whale-free areas and select the sequence of seismic lines to be surveyed. A scout vessel with MMOs aboard was positioned 4 km shoreward of the active seismic vessel to provide better visual coverage of the 4-5 km buffer and to help define the inshore edge of the 4-5 km buffer. A second scout vessel remained near the seismic vessel. Shore-based observers determined whale numbers, distribution, and behavior during and after the seismic survey. Acoustic monitoring documented received sound levels near and in the main whale feeding area. Statistical analyses of aerial survey data indicated that about 5-10 gray whales moved away from waters near (inshore of) the seismic survey during seismic operations. They shifted into the core gray whale feeding area farther south, and the proportion of gray whales observed feeding did not change over the study period. Five shutdowns of the air guns were invoked for gray whales seen within or near the buffer. A previously unknown gray whale feeding area (the Offshore feeding area) was discovered south and offshore from the nearshore Piltun feeding area. The Offshore area has subsequently been shown to be used by feeding gray whales during several years when no anthropogenic activity occurred near the Piltun feeding area. Shore-based counts indicated that whales continued to feed inshore of the Odoptu block throughout the seismic survey, with no significant correlation between gray whale abundance and seismic activity. Average values of most behavioral parameters were similar to those without seismic surveys. Univariate analysis showed no correlation between seismic sound levels and any behavioral parameter. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after allowance for environmental covariates, 5 of 11 behavioral parameters were statistically correlated with estimated seismic survey-related variables; 6 of 11 behavioral parameters were not statistically correlated with seismic survey-related variables. Behavioral parameters that were correlated with seismic variables were transient and within the range of variation attributable to environmental effects. Acoustic monitoring determined that the 4-5 km buffer zone, in conjunction with reduction of the air gun array to 14 guns and 1,640 in³, was effective in limiting sound exposure. Within the Piltun feeding area, these mitigation measures were designed to insure that western gray whales were not exposed to received levels exceeding the 163 dB re 1 μPa (rms) threshold. This was among the most complex and intensive mitigation programs ever conducted for any marine mammal. It provided valuable new information about underwater sounds and gray whale responses during a nearshore seismic program that will be useful in planning future work. Overall, the efforts in 2001 were successful in reducing impacts to levels tolerable by western gray whales. Research in 2002-2005 suggested no biologically significant or population-level impacts of the 2001 seismic survey.

AB  - We examined avian use of a lakeshore buffer strip and an undisturbed lakeshore in eastern Maine during 1984-85. Breeding bird density and species richness were lower in the buffer strip than in the undisturbed lakeshore. Of 35 species that nested in both study areas, 11 species nested only in the undisturbed lakeshore and 3 nested only in the buffer strip. A harvest index (HI) was developed to compare avian response to timber harvest within the buffer strip. Birds associated with forest interiors were observed less frequently on sites with a high HI than on sites with a low HI (e.g., blackburnian warbler, ovenbird, northern parula warbler). Species often found in cutover areas or edges were frequently counted on sites with a high HI. Eight species were found most frequently in lightly cut areas (i.e., low HI), 4 most frequently in moderate cuts, and 9 in greater HI. Although more species of birds were observed each year in the undisturbed lakeshore, the buffer strip provided breeding habitat for songbirds. For both years, 59% of all recorded breeding bird species were observed at both the undisturbed lakeshore and the buffer strip

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are important elements in landscapes that often provide a disproportionately wide range of ecosystem services and conservation benefits. Their protection and restoration have been one of the top environmental management priorities across the US over the last several years. Despite the level of concern, visibility and management effort, little is known about trends in riparian habitats. Moreover, little is known about whether or not cumulative efforts to restore and protect riparian zones and floodplains are affecting the rates of riparian habitat change nationwide. To address these issues, we analyzed riparian land cover change between the early 1970s and the late 1990s/early 2000s using existing spatial data on hydrography and land cover. This included an analysis of land cover changes within 180 m riparian buffer zones, and at catchment scales, for 42,363 catchments across 63 ecoregions of the continental US. The total amount of forest and natural land cover (forests, shrublands, wetlands) in riparian buffers declined by 0.7 and 0.9%, respectively across the entire study period. Gains in grassland/shrubland accounted for the 0.2% lower percentage of total natural land cover loss relative to forests. Conversely, urban and developed land cover (urban, agriculture, and mechanically disturbed lands) increased by more than 1.3% within riparian buffers across the entire study period. Despite these changes, we documented an opposite trend of increasing proportions of natural and forest land cover in riparian buffers versus the catchment scale. We surmise that this trend might reflect a combination of natural recovery and cumulative efforts to protect riparian ecosystems across the US. However, existing models limit our ability to assess the impacts of these changes on specific ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of changes observed in this study on the sustainability of ecosystem services. We also recommend opportunties for future riparian change assessments.

AB  - The loss of non-crop habitat is often suggested to be a key driver of biodiversity decline on arable land. Grass buffer strips on cereal field edges, to reduce erosion and agro-chemical runoff into surface water, could be useful to mitigate this diversity loss as they are often assumed to provide refuge and food for invertebrates, small mammals and birds. Evidence for this idea is, however, scarce and it remains unclear whether densely vegetated buffer strips benefit biodiversity in structurally complex landscapes of Northern Europe. Here, we examined whether buffer strips affected breeding skylark Alauda avensis numbers and its main food supply (i.e. beetles Coleoptera and spiders Arachnida) on cereal fields in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. We also examined whether buffer strip effects on skylark density depended on seasonal sward height differences between sowing regimes (spring- vs. autumn-sown) as they presumably influence seasonal invertebrate accessibility. Fields with buffer strips supported on average 0.51±0.26 more skylark territories per hectare up to 100m into the field and boosted invertebrate activity densities compared to fields without buffer strips. These effects were most apparent early in spring, but persisted throughout the sampling period, and were similar among spring and autumn sown fields. Thus, our results provide evidence to suggest that buffer strips target multiple environmental objectives on cereal fields in heterogeneous farmland. Future research should work to identify buffer strip management practices that further increase their value to biodiversity at the local scale, and investigate how they affect farmland biodiversity in different landscape types at larger spatial scales for more efficient implementation across Europe.

AB  - Context. Buffer zones are supposed to serve the dual purpose of 'extension buffering', or an extension of core habitat areas, and 'socio buffering' to provide goods and services to humans; however, few studies have evaluated both human use of buffer zones and the occurrence of wildlife. Aims. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effects of human disturbance on wildlife by recording the use of the 4-km-wide buffer zone of Huai Kha Kaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKKWS), Thailand, by humans and domestic animals. Methods. Occurrence of signs of large mammals were recorded along 37 transects and relationships among distance to settlements, human activities, occurrence of domestic animals and different wildlife species were analysed. Key results. In total, 210 interviewed respondents from adjacent villages all used the buffer zone, and the transect survey revealed that a large proportion of the plots (71%) were used by humans and/or domestic animals. The frequency of human use decreased linearly with distance from the buffers-zone edge, whereas the use by cattle decreased rapidly at a distance of 2000m from the buffer-zone edge. In general, the HKKWS buffer zone was a suitable habitat for several wildlife species. Sambar deer and banteng occurred in >25% of the plots. The proportion of plots with signs of sambar deer, banteng and elephant was negatively associated with the proportion of plots with signs of domestic animals, whereas the proportion of plots with signs of common muntjac was negatively associated with the proportion of plots with signs of human activities. Conclusions. The results from the present study suggest that the 4-km buffer zone in HKKWS reduces the impact of both humans and domestic animals. Implications. The size of human populations, restrictions for grazing domestic animals and habitat quality are suggested to be factors of importance for establishment of well designed buffer zones.

AB  - The use of gypsiferous mine water for irrigation of agricultural crops is a promising technology that could add value through agricultural production and utilise mine effluent. Crop response to irrigation with gypsiferous mine water, as well as the impact on soil and groundwater resources were investigated in a three-year field trial set up at Kleinkopje Colliery (Witbank, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa). Sugar-beans, maize and wheat were irrigated with four centre pivots on virgin and rehabilitated land, under three irrigation management regimes using two qualities of mine water. Good crop yields were obtained compared to dry-land cropping. Waterlogging in certain areas of the fields indicated that especially rehabilitated land should be properly prepared and, where necessary, waterways built to prevent yield reduction. Soil salinity increased over the duration of the trial due to high concentrations of Ca2+, SO42- and Mg2+ in the irrigation water, but this never reached levels critical to yields of most crops. Exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the soil increased with time, whilst K+ decreased. Plant analyses indicated possible nutrient deficiencies, which should be easily managed through corrective fertilisation. The groundwater impact was limited based on borehole measurements, indicating the presence of a buffer zone between the cropped soil profile and groundwater, but this should be monitored over a longer period. Commercial production of crops under irrigation with gypsiferous mine water is feasible and the resulting environmental impact is limited, but further research is required to confirm these findings over a longer period.

The effectiveness of total N removal from the sewage was 79.9% in spring-summer season and 50.5% in autumn-winter. Improving winter sewage treatment parameters needs a concept of more efficient preliminary bed, preceeding soil-turf slope strip. Satisfactory functioning of septic tank was observed within three year operation period, without any removal of the sediment

AB  - This study was conducted to define diversity and community structure of ground-dwelling spider species in agricultural field margins and to propose potential biological indicator species or groups by focusing on dominant groups for comparison of biodiversity among habitats. The study was conducted in Paltan-myun, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Ground-dwelling spiders were collected by pitfall traps from November 2000 to October 2003 in four agricultural field margin types (levee, dike, hillock and streamside). The biodiversity of spider species was higher in the levee and dike than in the hillock and streamside. A similar trend was shown in the biodiversity of dominant spider species. Habitat types were well separated according to overall spider species as well as dominant spider species. The hillock was distinctive from the other habitat types. Linyphiidae, Lycosidae and Theridiidae, the dominant spider families in the study sites, distinguished the hillock from other habitat types but failed to do so in the other habitat types. The dominant ground-dwelling spider species appear to have considerable potential as biological indicators for rapid biodiversity assessment and habitat discrimination.

AB  - The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is in   the process of designing a national REDD+ mechanism to allow   it to access donor funding in the medium term, and funding   from a potential performance based mechanism in the long   term. This policy brief is focused on the broad question of   how REDD+ can address underlying community issues such as   lack of access to forest land, and does not deal with the   more specific questions of legal and institutional   frameworks for such a mechanism. More specifically, the   brief highlights the need and opportunity for integrating   community development approaches into a REDD+ framework. The   brief is based largely on a review of literature on Payments   for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs, on interviews with a   number of representatives from Indonesian small grants   programs, and on discussions with the team that is involved   in the implementation of PNPM programs at the World Bank   Office in Jakarta. Indonesia is a major Green House Gas   (GHG) emitter (about 2.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide   equivalent in 2005) and most of the emissions come from   deforestation and peatland degradation. Indonesia has   approximately 94 million hectares of natural and planted   forests, representing around 52 percent of its total land   area. The Ministry of environment estimates that in 2000, as   much as 60 percent of Indonesia's total GHG emissions   were due to land use changes, including deforestation,   forest degradation and peat loss. In recent years, REDD+ has   become a focus of policy development in Indonesia. The   Forestry Research and Development Agency (FORDA) took the   lead in 2007 by forming the Indonesia Forest Climate   Alliance (IFCA) to articulate a national approach in   response to shifting opportunities emerging from   international negotiations on climate action and financing.

AB  - In December 2008, the draft programmes of measures (PoM) have been published in the EU member states, which list the measures that will be taken to enhance the ecological status of surface and groundwater bodies, and to reach the environmental objectives of the EU‐Water Framework Directive (WFD). We have analysed the German PoM to identify the main pressures and the restoration measures water managers planned to implement in streams and rivers. The objective was to evaluate the PoM and to identify the main, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management on which applied river research should focus on. In general, the selection of measures in the PoM was reasonable. In accordance with the analysis of pressures and impacts in Germany, the PoM focussed on measures addressing morphological alterations and river continuity, and the results indicated that diffuse source pollution and fine sediment input were additional main pressures in Central European streams and rivers. Although point source pollution was not a main pressure in most rivers, respective point source measures have been selected for many water bodies. Apparently, these were so‐called basic measures that have to be taken due to other EU‐Directives or national laws. Therefore, although in line with the WFD, it seemed doubtful if the point source measures would help to substantially enhance the ecological status. Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge on the effect of restoration measures and a specific knowledge gap in how to enhance the ecological state of heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) in the lowland region with a high land‐use pressure, which was reflected by the high share of water bodies for which conceptual measures have been selected (e.g. developing management plans). Based on the analysis of the PoM and a literature review, we identified the following, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management: (i) the morphodynamics of river reaches where natural channel dynamics have been restored, (ii) the combined effect of measures addressing diffuse nutrient and fine sediment input at different spatial scales (e.g. riparian buffer strips and land‐use changes), (iii) methods to identify suitable and efficient measures and to define environmental objectives for HMWB and (iv) the effect of measures on less well‐studied biological groups like macrophytes and phytoplankton. There is a strong need to summarize recent research results on these issues, to identify the knowledge gaps and research needs in detail, and to make the results of such a comprehensive literature review or meta‐analysis available for the next 6‐year management cycle and second WFD management plans.

AB  - Conventional management of shoreline forest in harvested boreal landscapes involves retention of treed buffer strips to provide habitat for wildlife species and protect aquatic habitats from deleterious effects of harvesting. With shoreline forests being considered for harvest in several jurisdictions, it is important to determine the potential impacts of this disturbance on birds. In this study, responses of riparian- and upland-nesting birds to three levels of harvest (0%-50%, 50%-75%, and 75%-100% within 100 m of the water) in shoreline forests around boreal wetlands were assessed 1 year before and each year for 4 years after harvest relative to unharvested reference sites. Upland-nesting species showed variable responses to harvest, with greatest declines in abundance of interior forest nesting species (e.g., Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapillus L.) with the highest levels of harvest. Shrub-nesting and generalist species increased in abundance in harvest treatments relative to reference sites. Riparian birds showed little response to harvest, suggesting that shoreline forest harvest has little effect on their abundance up to 4 years after harvest. Retention of small buffers may not be an effective management strategy for conservation of birds occupying shoreline forests, particularly interior forest nesting species. We suggest that alternatives to conventional buffer management be explored.

AB  - In developing countries, participatory land-use planning is seen as a panacea to mitigate land-use conflicts and enhance land productivity. This assumption has not been thoroughly tested in wildlife corridors. Three villages were selected for this study. Several methods were used to provide indication of the performance of the plans against their stated objectives of mitigating conflicts and conserving wildlife corridors. Three hundred and fifty-eight households and eight park and extension workers were interviewed. In addition, focus group discussion with the nomadic Barabeig, field assessment and review of land-use plan/general management plan reports were carried out. Results reveal that land-use plans failed to achieve their set objectives. For example, 75% of the households held this view. Major causes of failure were insufficient participation by stakeholders in the planning process, lack of robust, transparent and accountable implementation strategies, inadequacy of qualified staff and lack of 'holistic approach' to the planning process. Taking these findings into account, an improved buffer zone land-use planning framework is suggested. For the framework to enhance both conservation and development and to enable policies and legislation, equitable benefit sharing and conservation education, initiation of compensation schemes for depredation caused by wild animals and intensification of patrols are required.

AB  - For many years, urban natural landscapes have been damaged or destroyed through unplanned or poorly implemented developments. New efforts in urban landscape development encourage professionals to propose practices and multi¬functional landscape features to satisfy social requirements as well as to save and enhance urban ecosystems. Using Hymenoptera as biodiversity indicators, this study examined how implementation of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) using bioretention swales in place of conventional urban greenspaces can influence urban biodiversity. The study investigated the biodiversity and habitat values of nine bioretention swales and nine corresponding greenspaces in the Melbourne area in a summer survey. The relationship between habitat factors and species assemblages of these landscapes was also examined. The results showed a decreasing trend of biodiversity from bioretention swales to gardenbed-type to lawn-type greenspaces. This result may imply similar patterns of decreasing favourable habitat features for species in these landscapes. More structural and compositional heterogeneity of planting in bioretention swales, indicated by a higher number of plant taxa and higher coverage of mid-stratum vegetation, and optimal soil pH ranges were the main habitat factors attracting Hymenopteras to these landscapes. The outcomes of this research has practical implementations for landscape professionals who are designing and managing ecologically sustainable urban landscapes using a combination of bioretention swales and conventional filter strip greenspaces in urban streetscapes.

AB  - Vegetative buffers have been shown to reduce nutrient loss associated with the transport of detached soil particles and may through plant uptake offer a means to capture dissolved nutrients moving to surface waters through the soil solution. The objective of this 4-year study was to evaluate changes in the biomass and P content of the roots and shoots of plants growing in a multi-species versus a single species riparian buffer as an index of P capture potential. Periodic harvests of above ground vegetation were combined with root cores to estimate the total standing biomass and the pool of P in plant tissue in three vegetative cover types dominated by either switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-smooth bromegrass (Bromis inermis Leyss) mix, or a fast growing superior cottonwood (Populus deltoids Bartr., clone 42-7). An existing stand of smooth brome served as the single species control. Standing biomass increased in all three cover types during the 4 years of study, with the greatest increases observed in the cottonwood (2345 g m-²) and switchgrass (1818 g m-²). Biomass production in the smooth brome control did not change during the study period. Based on the 4th-year samples, standing pools of P closely paralleled total plant biomass and root surface area with cottonwood accumulating the greatest amount of P at 19.4 g m-² compared to 4.3 g m-² for the smooth brome control. Estimates of potential P export via biomass harvest from a mixed buffer over a 4-year interval were 101 kg ha-¹ compared to 62 kg ha-¹ for the smooth brome control; a 63% increase in export capacity due largely to the inclusion of cottonwood. Addition of a fast growing woody species combined with periodic biomass harvests has the potential to reduce P movement to surface waters.

AB  - This study was conducted at Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia from Feb 2001 to April 2002 for field study, and Jul to Aug 2003 for GIS [geographical information system] analysis. Factors affecting land use changes at the individual family and village factor levels of the 15 buffer zone villages associated with four major vegetation types, namely lowland, monsoon, lower montane, and anthropogenic of Lore Lindu National Park were examined. This study aimed to determine the dominant driving factors for land use change from natural forest to non-forest, and its implications, on biodiversity. Village surveys were conducted to gather individual family data, i.e. family size, educational attainment, agricultural land possession in the village, agricultural income, ranger activity and agricultural land inside the National Park areas, using semi-structured interview. General village information included population, migration, distance to the city, and ground check for potential agricultural land in the village through key informant interviews and direct field observation. Forest monitoring with a transact of 50 m apart and length up to 1,300 meter was established for each village. The number of trees with less than 50 cm dbh, trees with 20-50 cm dbh, rattan clumps with stem less 8 m, rattan stumps, and vegetation types were used as proxy for biodiversity status. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine the dominant factors of land use changes at the individual family and village levels. Individual or a combination of the nine driving variables, namely population, family size, education attainment, number of migrant families, range activity, agricultural land possession, agricultural income, potential agricultural land in the village, and road distance to the city were tested. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationships between land use change and biodiversity status. Net present value of the natural forest and non-forest land uses were computed in the benefit and cost analysis. The dominant factors for land use change at the village level were migrants and education, and agricultural land possession at the individual family level. Hence, changes in forest structure resulted to a negative effect in biodiversity status. The net present value (NPV) of land use change from natural forest to non-forest was negative. This implies that the area should be better retained as a natural forest. Collaborative management with appropriate zonation implementation is one feasible solution to long-term biodiversity conservation in Lore Lindu National Park.

AB  - The effect of aquaculture, especially shrimp farming, on agriculture has caused heated debate among aquaculturists, agriculturists, and non-governmental organizations. As data on the negative impact of shrimp farming on adjacent rice fields are not available, a study was undertaken in rice fields skirting three shrimp farms: a semi-intensive farm; an extensive farm; and a semi-intensive farm with a buffer zone. The buffer zone was found to be helpful in preventing salinization of the adjacent agricultural fields and the Electrical Conductivity (EC) values (less than 1) reported were found to be harmless to the rice crop. Thus, aquaculture and agriculture can coexist in coastal areas if there are buffer zones in between.

AB  - Ranong Mangrove Biosphere Reserve situates in Muang district, Ranong province about 650 km southwest from Bangkok. The extent of the area is 30,309 ha. (189,431 rai) or 303.09 square kilometers cover the whole Tambon Ngao and some parts of Tambon Pak Nam, Tambon Bang Rin, Tambon Rachakrut. On the Eastern part, the boundary reach the watershed diversion of Kao Chom Laem, Kao Nam Tok, and Kao Nom Sao. The mountainous areas are under preserved forest while the low land and undulating terrain are occupied by privates which have been used for agriculture, urbanization, and also some areas were abandoned after finishing tin mining. On the Western part, is the tidal influenced areas which running from north to south are the active tidal flat. Soils which had been founded are derived from two major kinds of parent materials: the first is marine sediments, and the second is in-situ from granite, gneiss, shale, and phyllite. These rocks when weathering give rise to the moderately low or medium fertility status, and the soils that derived from shale and phyllite are generally shallow. Land uses and land covers are hill forest, mangrove forest, orchards, field crops, while around the mangrove areas are significant in the near shore fisheries which provide the major sources of income to the local villagers. The Ranong Mangrove Biosphere Reserve has been proposed according to their potential, land uses, drainage system, territory boundary, and the deepest channel for navigation routes. The Ranong Mangrove Biosphere Reserve has been zoned for 4 Cores and others consist of : Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, and Core 4 with the extents of 2,781, 5,406 20,681, and 6,719 rai, respectively. Around the Core zones are the Buffer zone with the extents of 39,594 rai, the Sea area of 79,731 rai, and the Transitional zone of 39,594 rai.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to develop Water Quality Indices (WQI) that could be utilized to describe the water quality in the Cool Run tributary and to evaluate the impact of BMP implementation within the University of Delaware Agricultural Experimental Station Farm (UDAESFF) on water quality. A variety of water quality parameters have been measured at eight sites within the UDAESF over the past three years. Based on this data there has been a positive impact on the water quality as Cool Run exits the UDAESF and continues through residential areas. Many sections of the stream within the UDAESF are still impaired from previous farm management practices. New management practices have been implemented during the study period these include a manure collection system and a constructed wetland. Older management practices have been in place since before 2001, these practices include riparian buffer zones, prevention of livestock from entering the stream and the addition of a weir. A working model was developed to allow the WQI to be used for the evaluation of up to eight different parameters sets or to be used to create a spatial distribution of the WQI values as the stream flows through the UDAESF. The model was used for the evaluation and rating of the individual sites and the Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are in place. Evaluations were completed using the effects on streams associated with the individual BMPs and parameters that related general stream health. Future researchers will be able to use and update the Kiliszek Water Quality Index (KWQI) with the current Delaware water quality standards and criteria to monitor the quality of water within the Cool Run Stream.

AB  - Transport and fate of dissolved nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) in groundwater and its significance to nitrogen dynamics within agro-ecosystems are poorly known in spite of significant potential of N<sub>2</sub>O to global warming and ozone depletion. Increasing denitrification in riparian buffers may trade a reduction in nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) transport to surface waters for increased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions resulting from denitrification-produced N<sub>2</sub>O dissolved in groundwater being emitted into the air when groundwater flows into a stream or a river. This study quantifies the transport and fate of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> and dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O moving from crop fields through riparian buffers, assesses whether groundwater exported from crop fields and riparian buffers is a significant source of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, and evaluates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology to estimate dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O emission. We measured concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>; chloride (Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>); pH; dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O, dissolved oxygen (DO), and organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater under a multi-species riparian buffer, a cool-season grass filter, and adjacent crop fields located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. In both the multi-species riparian buffer and the cool-season grass filter, concentrations of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O in the groundwater did not change as it passed through the sites, even when the concentrations of groundwater NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> were decreased by 50% and 59%, respectively, over the same periods. The fraction of N lost to leaching and runoff (0.05) and the modified N<sub>2</sub>O emission factor, [ratio of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O flux to N input (0.00002)] determined for the cropped fields indicate that the current IPCC methodology overestimates dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O flux in the sites. A low ratio between dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O flux and soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission (0.0003) was estimated in the cropped fields. These results suggest that the riparian buffers established adjacent to crop fields for water quality functions (enhanced denitrification) decreased NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> and were not a source of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O. Also, the flux of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O from the cropped field was negligible in comparison to soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission in the crop fields.

AB  - While water quality functions of conservation buffers established adjacent to cropped fields have been widely documented, the relative contribution of these re-established perennial plant systems to greenhouse gases has not been completely documented. In the case of methane (CH4), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH4 production. This study quantifies CH4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-old re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. Forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density (P < 0.01); and higher pH (P < 0.01), total carbon (TC) (P < 0.01), and total nitrogen (TN) (P < 0.01) than crop field soils. There was no significant relationship between CH4 flux and soil moisture or soil temperature among sites within the range of conditions observed. Cumulative CH4 flux was –0.80 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 in the cropped field, –0.46 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 within the forest buffers, and 0.04 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 within grass filters, but difference among vegetation covers was not significant. Results suggest that CH4 flux was not changed after establishment of perennial vegetation on cropped soils, despite significant changes in soil properties.

AB  - Denitrification within riparian buffers may trade reduced nonpoint source pollution of surface waters for increased greenhouse gas emissions resulting from denitrification-produced nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). However, little is known about the N<sub>2</sub>O emission within conservation buffers established for water quality improvement or of the importance of short-term N<sub>2</sub>O peak emission following rewetting dry soils and thawing frozen soils. Such estimates are important in reducing uncertainties in current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies estimating soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission which are based on N inputs. This study contrasts N<sub>2</sub>O emission from riparian buffer systems of three perennial vegetation types and an adjacent crop field, and compares measured N<sub>2</sub>O emission with estimates based on the IPCC methodology. We measured soil properties, N inputs, weather conditions and N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from soils in forested riparian buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and a crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa, USA. Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils in all riparian buffers (5.8 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> in 2006–2007) were significantly less than those from crop field soils (24.0 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> in 2006–2007), with no difference among the buffer vegetation types. While N<sub>2</sub>O peak emissions (up to 70-fold increase) following the rewetting of dry soils and thawing of frozen soils comprised 46–70% of the annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils in the crop field, soils in the riparian buffers were less sensitive to such events (3 to 10-fold increase). The ratio of N<sub>2</sub>O emission to N inputs within riparian buffers (0.02) was smaller than those of crop field (0.07). These results indicate that N<sub>2</sub>O emission from soils within the riparian buffers established for water quality improvement should not be considered a major source of N<sub>2</sub>O emission compared to crop field emission. The observed large difference between measured N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and those estimated using the IPCC's recommended methodology (i.e., 87% underestimation) in the crop field suggests that the IPCC methodology may underestimate N<sub>2</sub>O emission in the regions where soil rewetting and thawing are common, and that conditions predicted by future climate-change scenarios may increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.

AB  - The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS) and its cooperators to design and evaluate the efficiency of riparian buffer ecosystems for nonpoint source pollution reduction. REMM requires numerous inputs to simulate water movement, sediment transport, and nutrient cycling in the buffer system. In order to identify critical model inputs and their uncertainties, a univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted for nine REMM output variables. The magnitude of each input parameter was changed from -50% to +50% from the baseline data in 12 intervals or, in some cases, the complete range of an input was tested. Baseline model inputs for the sensitivity analysis were taken from Gibbs Farm, Georgia, where REMM was tested using a 5-year field dataset. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that REMM responses were most sensitive to weather inputs, with minimum daily temperature having the greatest impact on the nitrogen-related outputs. For example, the 100% change (-50% to +50%) in minimum daily temperature input values yielded a 164.4% change in total nitrogen (N), a 109.3% change in total nitrate (NO3), and a 127.1% change in denitrification. REMM was most sensitive to precipitation with regard to total flow leaving the riparian vegetative buffer zone (199.8%) and sediment yield (138.2%). Deep seepage (12.2%), volumetric water content (24.8%), and pore size index (6.5%) in the buffer soil profile were the most influential inputs for the output water movement. Sediment yield was most sensitive to Manning's coefficient (46.6%), bare soil percent (40.7%), and soil permeability (6.1%). For vegetation, specific leaf area, growing degree day coefficients, and maximum root depth influenced the nitrogen related outputs. Overall results suggest that because of the high sensitivity to weather parameters, on-site weather data is needed for model calibration and validation. The model's relatively low sensitivity to vegetation parameters also appears to support the use of regional vegetation datasets that would simplify model implementation without compromising results.

AB  - In this study, a soil monitoring system for a hillslope with steep relief and shallow soil depth was designed and installed to represent efficiently the spatial and temporal features of soil moisture. The study was conducted on a mountainous hillslope of the Sulmachun catchment (northeastern South Korea). The positions of soil moisture sensors were determined through a sequential procedure including intensive geomorphologic surveying of the study area, surface and subsurface terrain analysis, and inverse surveying. Using 26 sensors, soil moisture data from 11 locations were measured and recorded at hourly intervals over 380 h from 6 to 22 November 2003. Soil moisture response patterns were captured for a few consecutive rainfall events. The monitoring results are discussed in the context of soil moisture variations with terrain attributes. The immediate recharge and fast recession after a peak are the primary features of soil moisture in the upper zone. Stability and significant storage increase are distinct characteristics of soil moisture in the buffer zone and the flow path zone respectively. Spatial distribution of temporal soil moisture variations can be characterized in terms of recession, stability and recharge depending upon the topographic classification of a hillslope for this approach.

AB  - Tree species identification is important for a variety of natural resource management and monitoring activities including riparian buffer characterization, wildfire risk assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and wildlife habitat assessment. Intensity data recorded for each laser point in a LIDAR system is related to the spectral reflectance of the target material and thus may be useful for differentiating materials and ultimately tree species. The aim of this study is to test if LIDAR intensity data can be used to differentiate tree species. Leaf-off and leaf-on LIDAR data were obtained in the Washington Park Arboretum, Seattle, Washington, USA. Field work was conducted to measure tree locations, tree species and heights, crown base heights, and crown diameters of individual trees for eight broadleaved species and seven coniferous species. LIDAR points from individual trees were identified using the field-measured tree location. Points from adjacent trees within a crown were excluded using a procedure to separate crown overlap. Mean intensity values of laser returns within individual tree crowns were compared between species. We found that the intensity values for different species were related not only to reflective properties of the vegetation, but also to a presence or absence of foliage and the arrangement of foliage and branches within individual tree crowns. The classification results for broadleaved and coniferous species using linear discriminant function with a cross validation suggests that the classification rate was higher using leaf-off data (83.4%) than using leaf-on data (73.1%), with highest (90.6%) when combining these two LIDAR data sets. The result also indicates that different ranges of intensity values between two LIDAR datasets didn't affect the result of discriminant functions. Overall results indicate that some species and species groups can be differentiated using LIDAR intensity data and implies the potential of combining two LIDAR datasets for one study.

AB  - To find out the status and characteristics of exotic plants in the Gwangreung Forest, a representative forest ecosystem in central Korea, we surveyed the species composition, coverage, and habitat illuminance of exotic plant species in a set of quadrats established along roads and trails in and around the Gwangreung Forest and buffer zone areas, In 1932, only five species of exotic plants were found along paths and roads in the Gwangreung Forest. However, the number of species in the forest has dramatically increased since 2000, when Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. and A. trifida L. were first recorded, and in 2007, 38 species of exotic plants were recorded. Among the 11 families, 23 genera and 25 species of exotic plants recorded in the quadrats, Compositae was the most common family (11 species), and perennial herbs, 42%, were the most frequently occurring life type, followed by annual herbs (31%) and biennial herbs (19%). Plants of North American origin comprised 48% of exotic species identified in our surveys. Exotics were found most frequently in quadrats along roads in the forest, followed by the buffer zones and hiking trails. The number of species and individuals of exotic plants decreased as we moved deeper into the forest, but Aster pilosus Willd. and Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. were identified along hiking trails in the interior, and appeared to be capable of spreading further and more rapidly into the forest than other species.

AB  - A beverage brewing machine which has upper and lower brewing chambers which are movable relative to each other so as to clamp a strip-shaped filter there between during the brewing process and the chambers can be separated so as to allow the filter strip to be removed from the brewing chamber and the beverage residual wiped therefrom after which are then resealed for the next cycle. A hold down grid engages the top surface of the filter to hold it down as a piston moves in the lower chamber upwardly to force air through the filter to agitate the beverage. When the piston reaches top dead center, the hold down grid is lifted. When the piston passes the opening the brewed coffee is poured. A loose connection is provided between the connecting rod for the piston and the driving crank arm so that the piston remains longer at the top and bottom of its stroke. Due to agitation of ground and oxygenation of the mixture, or a combination of both, by adding a high volume of air during the brewing process, increased extraction results.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest have become increasingly patchy, dominated by early successional forests. Several amphibian species associated with forested headwater systems have emerged as management concerns, especially after clearcutting. Given that headwater streams comprise a large portion of the length of flowing waterways in western Oregon forests, there is a need to better understand how forest management affects headwater forest taxa and their habitats. Mitigation strategies include alternatives to clearcutting, such as harvests that remove only part of the canopy and maintenance of riparian buffer strips. Our study investigates effects of upland forest thinning coupled with riparian buffer treatments on riparian and upland headwater forest amphibians, habitat attributes, and species-habitat associations. Amphibian captures and habitat variables were examined 5-6 years post-thinning within forest stands subject to streamside-retention buffers and variable-width buffers, as well as unthinned reference stands. We found no treatments effects, however, our results suggest that ground surface conditions (e.g., amount of rocky or fine substrate) play a role in determining the response of riparian and upland amphibians to forest thinning along headwater streams. Distance from stream was associated with amphibian abundance, hence retention of riparian buffers is likely important in maintaining microclimates and microhabitats needed for amphibians and other taxa. Moderate thinning and preservation of conditions in riparian and nearby upland areas by way of variable-width and streamside-retention buffers may be sufficient to maintain suitable habitat and microclimatic conditions vital to amphibian assemblages in managed headwater forests.

AB  - There is little understanding about the role eastern US forested headwater riparian areas play in protecting aquatic habitats and water quality from impacts of side slope forest harvest. To better understand this important riparian area function, we selected three sites from management units with a 2-age regeneration silvicultural prescription located on the Nantahala National Forest, North Carolina, USA. Each site was harvested and a riparian buffer was left uncut along the stream. Buffer widths were 10m and 30m; we included a 0m buffer to experimentally determine nutrient and riparian zone responses to forest cutting under extreme conditions. A fourth site was selected to serve as an uncut reference. Transects were established perpendicular to a 200m stream reach, from streamside to 50m upslope for intensive study. Forest cutting increased extractable NO₃ ⁻ at both 0-10cm and 10-30cm soil depths compared to pre-treatment concentrations. Soil solution NO₃ ⁻ concentrations increased only in harvested areas, on all sites; increases were greater in sites with narrow riparian buffers. Stream water NO₃ ⁻ concentration increased significantly following site harvest only on the 0m buffer site. Dissolved organic C and N did not respond to harvesting in either soil solution or stream samples. Our results suggest that riparian buffers are effective in removing NO₃ ⁻ from soil solution prior to its entering the stream.

AB  - This research highlights the spatial planning approach for coastal sustainability and adaptation to climate change. The dilemma of spatial planning in a dynamic and complex coastal environment as well as the establishment of a coastal buffer zone as an adaptation measure for climate change are elaborated upon. In particular, this study outlines the limitations of two of the traditional approaches used for spatial planning (optimization and simulation) and the opportunities that present themselves when combining both models for coastal zone planning. As a result, this study has developed an integrated modeling framework called MOPSD (Multi-Objective Programming and System Dynamic) that can be used for spatial land use planning in coastal areas. The case study is Cijin Island, located next to the Kaohsiung harbor, Taiwan; this location demonstrates that the proposed MOPSD modeling approach generates superior results when compared to each of the two traditional methods. This is mainly attributed to the consideration of deterministic and dynamic characteristics when evaluating the climate change adaptation at risk of coastal erosion.

AB  - A simple and sensitive detection system, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a soil microcosm, was developed to detect a bacterial catabolic gene in the rhizosphere. The inoculated population of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134, a phenol and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid utilizer, was readily detected by this technique, which permitted taking of samples from specific locations of root (including rhizosphere) and soil. The number of JMP134 viable cells (10(2)-10(3) cells), typically picked up by the nitrocellulose filter strip method, yielded sufficient amount of the target DNA to be detected by PCR. Primers encoding metapyrocatechase I (MPC I; catechol 2,3-dioxygenase) enabled the discrimination of at least five viable cells of JMP134 among the indigenous microorganisms inhabiting bush bean roots. This simplified PCR detection procedure facilitated monitoring of the specific degradative gene in the rhizosphere in only 5 h.

AB  - Gap fellings are used to promote multi-cohort structures and to restore other natural forest structures and processes in protected areas that have been altered by anthropogenic activities. Gaps and felled trees may also provide breeding material for species that in high numbers can cause significant tree mortality, growth reduction and consequent economic losses in surrounding production forests. In this study, the effect of restoration gap fellings on feeding intensity of Tomicus spp. (pine shoot beetles) was evaluated by counting fallen pine shoots at different distances from gaps in a protected area in eastern Finland. Gap fellings had a clear effect on the feeding intensity of the beetles. The average density of fallen shoots m⁻² was 17 within a 10-m distance from gaps but decreased rapidly to around 4 at the distance of 50m and beyond. The distance decay in shoot feeding is described well by the negative exponential models. Our results suggest that gap fellings have only a localized effect on shoot feeding by Tomicus in the forests surrounding the restoration gaps. In practical restoration, a buffer zone of 100-200m around the gap fellings, as implemented here, is enough to minimize economically significant growth reduction in surrounding production forests. As shown in this study, restoration of natural forest structures and dynamics to protect biodiversity is not necessarily in conflict with forest hygiene objectives in production forests.

AB  - Riparian forests often have a more diverse tree species composition and more woody debris than neighboring upland forests, but little is known about their importance for the conservation of deadwood-dependent species. We studied the forest characteristics and the diversity of wood fungi (poroid Aphyllophorales) in lakeside riparian (flat and sloping topography) and upland boreal forests in eastern Finland. Riparian forests had a higher density of broadleaved trees and broadleaved debris than did upland forests. A total of 48 species of wood fungi were recorded, including eight red-listed or old-growth forest indicator species. Overall, more species and records and greater diversity were observed in the flat riparian sites than in the sloped riparian and upland sites. The mean species richness did not differ significantly among site categories, indicating greater β diversity among the flat riparian sites. Species composition was more similar between the two riparian categories than between the riparian and upland sites. Riparian sites also hosted more fungal species associated with broadleaved trees. The results show that riparian forests support the diversity of wood fungi in managed boreal forests. Diversity of deadwood-dependent organisms can be promoted by leaving wider and completely unharvested riparian buffer zones.

AB  - Study of the forest and wildlive resource diversity was conducted from July 15,1999 through June 15,2000 in Phu Nok Saew, Kaset Somboon District Chaiyaphum Province on the biodiversity of the buffer zone in the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary. The study objectives focused on biodiversity, setting up a checklist of the flora and fauna with conservation status and addressing conservation issues. The flora of Phu Nok Saew is composed of 6 plant communities, (1) deciduous dipterocarp forest subtype Shorea siamensis consociation (2 structures, crown cover 80 percent, elevation 500 m.a.s.l.) (2) mixed deciduous forest subtype Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii consociation (2 structures, crown cover 40 percent, elevation 300-400 m. a.s.l. dominated by Gigantochloa albociliata bamboo) as well was (3) semievergreen forest, (4) disturbed forest, (5) forest plantation and (6) stream forest. Vascular plants were represented by 700 species of 439 genera and 139 families, comprising non-seed plants (14 species, 11 genera, 9 families), gymnosperms (1 species), monocotyledons (128 species, 85 genera, 20 families) and dicotyledons (557 species, 342 genera, 99 families). Of these species 2 are endemic, 10 introduced species, 34 exotic species and 657 native species. According to the Plants Protection Act 1987, 124 of these species are normally protected while 2 species are specially protected and 28 species fall under the Minor forest Protection Act 1987. The fauna consist of 295 vetebrates species of 196 genera, 85 families, 31 orders and 5 classes, including mammals (30 species, 24 genera, 14 families, 6 orders), birds (178 species, 108 genera, 39 families, 16 orders), reptiles (29 species, 22 genera, 10 families, 2 orders), amphibians (15 species, 9 genera, 4 families, 1 order) and fresh-water fishes (43 species, 33 genera, 18 families, 6 orders). Deciduous dipterocarp forest was the main habitat type and some other small areas of mixed deciduous forest, disturbed forest, agricultural areas, water areas, villages, forest plantation, semi-evergreen forest and cave are founded. According to the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 1992, 188 species are protected. Based on the Status of Wildlife in Thailand List (1997), Phu Nok Saew includes 1 endangered, 1 vulnerable, 1 data deficient and 1 endemic species of Thailand. Included here are 1 species introduced, 2 exotic and 184 native species. The biggest problem seem to originated from the servant government and villagers of the area.

AB  - Fine sediment accumulation was measured in streams in low-order forest watersheds across a gradient of selective harvesting with no protective riparian buffers. Comparisons were made among sites in selection-cut (40% canopy removal), shelterwood-cut (50% canopy removal), diameter limit cut (about 85% canopy removal), and undisturbed tolerant hardwood catchments. These were further compared with a headwater stream catchment not harvested but affected by logging road activities. The greatest increases in fine inorganic sediment occurred at the road-improvement site with mean bedload estimates more than 4000 times higher than pre-manipulation values. Sediment bedload was still significantly elevated 2 years after the road-improvement activities. Significant increases (up to 1900 times the pre-harvest average) in inorganic sediment also occurred at the highly disturbed diameter-limit site as a result of heavy ground disturbance and channeled flowpaths from skidder activity in riparian areas. Similar increases were detected at the selection-cut site but were attributable to secondary road construction in the runoff area. In the shelterwood harvest area, where logging roads were not a factor, no measurable increases in sediment deposition were detected. There was little indication that harvesting activities at any site affected the organic fraction or the particle size distribution of fine sediments. The results of this study suggest that riparian buffer zones may not be necessary for selective harvesting in hardwood forests at up to 50% removal, at least in terms of reducing sediment inputs.

AB  - In vegetated filter strips (VFS) the presence of perennial vegetation, rhizodeposition of labile organic substrates and the accumulation of an organic residue thatch layer may enhance microbial numbers and activity, thereby increasing the potential for mineralisation of herbicides and herbicide metabolites retained during run-off events. The objective of this laboratory experiment was to compare the mineralisation of atrazine and metolachlor with that of their respective metabolites in VFS and cultivated soil. With the exception of total bacteria, propagule density of the microbial groups, endogenous soil enzymes and microbial diversity were higher in the VFS soil. This correlated with increased mineralisation of metolachlor and its metabolites in the VFS soil and indicates potential for VFS to curtail the subsequent transport of these compounds. In contrast, the mineralisation of atrazine and the majority of its metabolites was substantially reduced in VFS soil relative to cultivated soil. Consequently, the potential for subsequent transport of atrazine and many of its metabolites may be greater in VFS soil than in cultivated soil if reduced mineralisation is not offset by increased sorption in the VFS.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that dissolved-phase metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide] transported in surface runoff is retained by vegetative filter strips to a greater degree than either metolachlor oxanilic acid [2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)amino]-2-oxoacetic acid] (OA) or metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid [2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl-1)amino]-2-oxoethanesulfonic acid] (ESA), two primary metabolites of metolachlor. Adsorption-desorption of ESA and OA in vegetated filter strip soil (VFSS) has not been evaluated, yet these data are required to assess the mobility of these compounds in VFSS. The objective of this experiment was to compare metolachlor, ESA, and OA adsorption and desorption parameters between VFSS and cultivated soil (CS). Adsorption and desorption isotherms were determined using the batch equilibrium procedure. With the exception of a 1.7-fold increase in organic carbon content in the VFSS, the evaluated chemical and physical properties of the soils were similar. Sorption coefficients for metolachlor were 88% higher in VFSS than in CS. In contrast, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, sorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 79% lower in both soils. Metolachlor desorption coefficients were 59% higher in the VFSS than in the CS. Desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were not different between soils. Relative to metolachlor, desorption coefficients for ESA and OA were at least 66% lower in both soils. These data indicate that the mobility of ESA and OA will be greater than metolachlor in both soils. However, higher organic carbon content in VFSS relative to CS may limit the subsequent transport of metolachlor from the vegetated filter strip.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes have been established in many European countries to counteract the ongoing decline of farmland birds. In this study, the selection of foraging habitat by breeding skylarks was examined in relation to agri-environmental management on Dutch farmland. Field margin use was quantified and, based on the observed flight distances, the appropriateness of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the study landscape was evaluated. Skylarks preferred field margins for foraging over all other habitat types relative to their surface area within the territories. The visiting rate of field margins decreased with increasing distance to the nest, and especially dropped markedly when the distance between the nest and a field margin exceeded 100m. Analysis of the current spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape suggested that the area of skylark breeding habitat within 100m of a field margin could be increased by 46%. This was due to the placement of field margins alongside unsuitable breeding habitat and to the positioning of field margins at short distances from each other. The efficiency of agri-environmental management for skylarks can likely be improved by a more careful spatial arrangement of field margins in the landscape.

AB  - The contamination of Spodic Cambisols and selected herb species (Dryopteris dilatata, Luzula luzuloides, Prenanthes purpurea, Rubus idaeus, Senecio ovatus and Solidago virgaurea) by potentially toxic elements (Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr) issuing from polluted atmosphere was studied in spruce stand and parallel clear-cut area on the locality Stoliky situated in the buffer zone of the National Park  Slovensky Raj close to Spisska Nova Ves. The element concentrations determined in extracts of soil samples by 2 mol/cubic dm HNO3 were as follows (mg/kg d.w.): Fe 3,600-4,300, Mn 1,100-1,300, Cu 81.1-100.6, Cr 1.16-2.00. The concentrations of elements in aboveground phytomass of dominant herb species ranged as follows (mg/kg d.w.): Cr 0.052-0.419, Cu 8.6-22.4, Fe 70.2-191.0 and Mn 1,043-3,457. Increased amounts of Cu and Mn (compared with the background values) were ascertained in all herb species, whereas the levels of Fe were higher only in Luzula luzuloides (clear-cut area) and Prenanthes purpurea (spruce stand). Cr concentrations were lower than background value. The values of Fe:Mn ratio (0.03-0.12) were markedly lower, while the values of Fe:Cr (403-1,867) and Cu:Fe (0.086-0.203) ratios were substantially higher compared with the normal values in herb species. They indicate disturbance in herb nutrition and nutrient cycling in the spruce ecosystems.

AB  - During the last few years, conflicts between agriculture and aquaculture have been an important issue in the Bac Lieu province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. A large area of rice production has been converted to shrimp or shrimp–rice based production systems that require the intake of saline water into fresh water zones that have been used for agriculture. To manage this conflict, the provincial authorities have reviewed land use plans and identified a buffer zone with a mixed land use system of shrimp–rice (rice in the rainy season and shrimp in the dry season when sluices are opened). Under the CPWF (Challenge Program on Water and Food) Project No. 25, role playing games (RPGs) were applied for analyzing the land and water management strategy of farmers in the buffer zone. The RPGs organized in three villages (Phong Thanh, Ninh Thanh Loi and Vinh Loc) indicate that due to much higher revenue earned from shrimp compared with rice, farmers are attempting numerous techniques to prolong the duration of saline water in their fields for shrimp cultivation. This strategy makes the growing of a subsequent rice crop impossible even in the rainy season, thus requiring harmonization of water management at different levels (farm and canal systems). The results from these RPGs also indicate the need for further research on cultivation techniques for the shrimp–rice systems and on participatory methods to achieve better understanding of farmers’ decisions.

AB  - L’Homme et ses pratiques participent aux changements de structure et d’organisation des paysages agricoles. L’évolution des modifications de la mosaïque paysagère tend vers une fragmentation progressive des habitats boisés. Les réseaux de haies des paysages bocagers interviennent alors en tant que corridors écologiques. Cette étude s’intéresse aux relations existantes entre la distribution de groupements de carabes forestiers et de carabes de cultures, et l’évolution des pratiques agricoles dans trois paysages, au cours du temps. L’aménagement parcellaire lié au remembrement et aux arasements individuels a entraîné une ouverture progressive du paysage par la diminution des réseaux de haies. Les trois paysages possèdent des structures très différentes allant d’un bocage dense à un bocage très ouvert. L’entretien des bordures de champs ainsi que l’occupation du sol aux abords des haies possèdent des caractéristiques propres à chaque  zone d’étude. Ces trois variables explicatives de la distribution des peuplements de carabes n’agissent pas à la même échelle temporelle. L’occupation du sol influence la distribution des carabes l’année même des relevés espèces, tandis que l’entretien influe par  le cumul d’années de traitements. L’aménagement parcellaire caractérisé par le grain du paysage ne semble pas influer de manière significative sur la distribution des groupements de carabes: l’effet potentiel du grain serait masqué par l’influence des deux autres variables. L’historique des pratiques est donc un élément fondamental dans la compréhension de la distribution des peuplements de coléoptères carabiques. Il reste néanmoins d’autres variables propres à la structure interne des haies ainsi que des analyses espèces-centrées qui doivent être prise en compte pour expliquer au mieux les patterns de distribution de ces espèces.

AB  - Salt tracers (sodium bromide/sodium chloride) and two different fluorescent tracers, uranine (UR) and sulforhodamine-B (SRB), were injected as a pulse into six different surface flow wetlands (SFWs). Salt tracers documented wetland hydraulics. The fluorescent tracers were used as a reference to mimic photolytic decay (UR) and sorption (SRB) of contaminants as illustrated by a comparison to a real herbicide (Isoproturon), which was used as a model for mobile pesticides. Tracer breakthrough curves were used to document residence time distributions, hydraulic efficiencies, peak attenuation and retention capacities of completely different wetland systems. A 530 m² forest buffer zone showed considerable peak attenuation but limited retention capabilities despite its large area. Approximately 80% of SRB was permanently retained in a re-structured 325 m² flood detention pond. These two non-steady SFWs indicated long-term tracer washout. The remaining four SFWs displayed constant outflow rates and steady-state flow conditions. Due to photolytic decay in a 330 m² row of three wetlands, UR was almost entirely degraded, but the SRB breakthrough suggested relatively low sorption. A 65 m² shallow flow-through wetland yielded negligible photolytic decay but showed considerable sorption losses. Finally two types of vegetated ditches were analysed. In one case, vegetation was removed from a 413 m long ditch immediately prior to tracer injection. A 30% loss by sorption to sediment and plant remnants occurred at the very beginning of the tracer breakthrough. Inside a second ditch, 80 m long and densely vegetated by Phragmites australis, sorption was even higher and yielded eightfold higher specific SRB retention rates. Although the present findings are only valid for low flow conditions, they indicate that a shallow water depth seems to be a key variable which may increase sorption of tracers and therefore contaminants. Large wetlands with deep water bodies may attenuate concentrations efficiently, but unit load reduction was found to be more significant in shallow systems even at much higher flow velocities.

AB  - The composition and structure of vegetation within riparian buffers prior to, and immediately post-harvesting in a managed radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) forest is described and compared with riparian buffers in residual adjoining native forest on the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. One hundred and twenty-one species (71% native) representing life forms from grasses to trees were recorded. The highest species richness, including both native and adventive (non-native) species, was found in riparian buffers in the post-harvest and native reference sites which had 18-25 species per site. Riparian buffers in mature pine plantations contained a mix of native species that was generally similar to, and not significantly reduced in species richness, from the reference native forest. Native species comprised 82-92% of the total cover in mature pre-harvest sites (irrespective of riparian width), and 99.8% in native reference sites. Compared with native forest the principal difference was a reduction of total cover in the upper tiers (5-12m), and some increase in cover in the lower tiers. Adventive species in post-harvest sites comprised 16-67% of the total cover and were most frequently found in riparian areas highly disturbed by recent harvesting of the pines, particularly where riparian buffers were narrow or absent. Invasion by light-demanding adventives is expected to be temporary and most species are likely to be shaded out as the new rotation of pine trees develops. Radiata pine plantations in Whangapoua Forest can provide suitable conditions for the development of riparian buffer zones that will become dominated by native species, similar in richness and structure to neighbouring native forest.

AB  - Borneo has experienced heavy deforestation and forest degradation during the past two decades. In this study the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer was used to monitor land cover change in Borneo between 2002 and 2005 in order to assess the current extent of the forest cover, the deforestation rate and the role of fire. Using Landsat and ground observation for validation it was possible to discriminate 11 land cover classes. In 2002 57% of the land surface of Borneo was covered with forest of which 74% was dipterocarp and more than 23% peat swamp forest. The average deforestation rate between 2002 and 2005 was 1.7% yr⁻ ¹. The carbon-rich ecosystem of peat swamp forests showed a deforestation rate of 2.2%. Almost 98% of all deforestation occurred within a range of 5 km to the forest edge. Fire is highly correlated with land cover changes. Most fires were detected in degraded forests. Ninety-eight per cent of all forest fires were detected in the 5 km buffer zone, underlining that fire is the major driver for forest degradation and deforestation.

AB  - Stream restoration projects that attempt to reduce channel incision and bank erosion by reconstructing the channel and grading and armoring stream banks (channel stability restoration projects) are common, particularly in urbanized watersheds. However, integrated assessment of changes in geomorphic processes and ecological properties within the channel and in the surrounding riparian zone induced by stability restoration has rarely been carried out across multiple restored streams. I provide such an assessment by measuring channel complexity, bed sediment dynamics, channel movement rates, riparian soil structure and function, and diatom communities in multiple restored streams located in urbanized watersheds and comparing these measurements to measurements from urban and forested reference streams.Stability restoration appears to have reduced lateral channel migration and channel incision through channel reshaping. Patterns of bed sediment movement were altered through the effects of added channel obstructions on flow dynamics and bed sediment size distribution. Channel stability restoration did not alter channel complexity, primarily because channel complexity was not reduced by urbanization as has commonly been assumed. Restoration did not alter diatom communities either, primarily because diatom communities responded more strongly to urbanization-induced changes in water chemistry. Riparian soils were negatively impacted by stability restoration, particularly compared to riparian buffer establishment, which had mostly neutral effects on riparian soils.Channel stability restoration can provide a minor increase in channel and bed sediment stability. However, changes in bed sediment stability were driven by in-channel restoration structures, which can be placed without grading the banks or reconstructing the channel. Riparian buffer restoration can also stabilize channels and will provide wood to channels, which can provide similar stabilization benefits as restoration structures. Restoration of channel stability using only in-channel structures and riparian vegetation planting would reduce the cost of stability restoration and reduce negative impacts to riparian soils.Even so, effects of stability restoration were often overwhelmed by processes operating beyond the channel boundaries, suggesting that reach-scale targeting of channel instability needs to be assessed at the watershed scale and may need to be given lower priority to such restoration approaches as stormwater management, which directly address the causes of channel instability.

AB  - Land use change has a major impact on goods and services that our environment supplies for society. While detailed ecological or biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the example of the historic development (1964–2004) in the district of Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii) pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced with a maximum land use change of 11% in the major land use classes between 1964 and 2004, we see a decrease of ecosystem function indicators up to 23%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004 without reaching the level of 1964.

Cropping structure, fitosociological survey of the buffer and littoral zone were investigated in 2000-02 and 2005-06. The highest concentration of nitrate and phosphates in the groundwater were found on cultivated fields and significantly decreased in direction to the littoral zone. The lowest values of the measure parameters were detected in the meadow and littoral zone during growing and non-growing seasons. Nitrate content in the water decreased approximately 95 percent, phosphates 47 percent in direction: arable field-meadow-littoral zone

AB  - Mandae watershed in Gangwon province has been known as one of soil erosion hot spot watersheds within Hanggang basin. Thus numerous efforts have been made to reduce soil erosion and pollutant loads into receiving watershed. However, proper best management practices have not been suggested because no monitoring flow and water quality data were available. Thus, modeling technique could not be utilized to evaluate water quality issue properly at Mandae watershed to develop and implement the best management practices. In this study, the SWAT model was applied to the Mandae watershed, Gangwon province to evaluate the SWAT prediction ability and water quality improvement with vegetated filter strip (VFS) in this study. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) and Coefficient of determination (R²) values for flow simulation were 0.715 and 0.802, respectively, and the NSE and R values were 0.903 and 0.920 for T-P simulation indicating the SWAT can be used to simulate flow and T-P with acceptable accuracies. The SWAT model, calibrated for flow and T-P, was used to evaluate water quality improvement with the VFS in agricultural fields. It was found that approximately 56.19 % of T-P could be reduced with vegetated filter strip of 5 m at the edge of agricultural fields within the watershed (34.86 % reduction with VFS of 1m, 48.29 % with VFS of 3 m). As shown in this study, the T-P, which plays key roles in eutrophication in the waterbodies, can be reduced with proper installation of the VFS.

AB  - Contour hedgerows and grass filter strips are important towards enhancing and sustaining productivity of sloping agricultural lands in medium to high rainfall regions. However, impact of such measures on erosion control, soil carbon sequestration and agronomic productivity have not been widely assessed for the small land holders in eastern India. Therefore, an on-farm study was conducted between 2001 and 2006 to evaluate the impact of the techniques on soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and pool; losses of water, soil and nutrients; soil moisture storage and agronomic yield on arable lands of 2–5% slope. The study was taken in 5.95ha area with six treatments and nine replications. Treatments consisted of two hedgerow species (Gliricidia sepium and Indigofera teysmanni) and a control, with or without grass filter strip (GFS) of a local species (Saccharum spp.). Using finger millet (Eleusine coracana) as the test crop, the hedgerow species were planted at 0.5m×0.5m spacing in staggered double rows and the GFS in a single row at 0.3m spacing. In general, Gliricidia+GFS was most conservation effective followed by Indigofera+GFS. It reduced runoff by 33% (10.7% runoff compared to 16.1% in control), soil loss by 35% (6.3Mgha⁻¹ compared to 9.71Mgha⁻¹ in control), and SOC loss through runoff by 50kgha⁻¹yr⁻¹. In addition, it resulted SOC build up at 0.352–1.354Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ at three graded distance from hedgerows, out of which 0.352Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ was sequestered due to soil reclamation and about 1.0Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ was retained due to barrier effect. With higher soil moisture storage by 28–37mm and 22–43mm at 12 and 17 days of dry spell, respectively, the grain yield of finger millet increased by 49% from 952kgha⁻¹ in control to 1413kgha⁻¹ in Gliricidia+GFS treatment. Addition of GFS significantly reduced the losses of water runoff, soil and nutrients in all the treatments, and increased SOC stock by 0.38–1.0Mgha⁻¹ in the 0.6m soil profile. The GFS also improved soil moisture storage by 9–12mm and 6–15mm at 12 and 17 days of dry spell, respectively. As compared to the pre-treated initial, the SOC stock decreased by 60–112kgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ in the control indicating on-going erosion process in unprotected lands. The study showed the C sink potential of erosion control measures in the sloping agricultural lands of eastern India.

AB  - 1. Recently habitat degradation, road construction and traffic have all increased with human populations, to the detriment of aquatic habitats and species. While numerous restoration programmes have been carried out, there is an urgent need to follow their success to better understand and compensate for the decline of amphibian populations. To this end, we followed the colonization success of an anuran community across multiple replacement ponds created to mitigate large-scale habitat disturbance. 2. Following construction of a highway in western France, a restoration project was initiated in 1999 and the success of restoration efforts was monitored. The amphibian communities of eight ponds were surveyed before they were destroyed. Replacement ponds were created according to precise edaphic criteria, consistent with the old pond characteristics and taking into account the amphibian species present in each. The presence of amphibian species was recorded every year during the breeding period for 4 years following pond creation. 3. Species richness initially declined following construction of the replacement ponds but generally returned to pre-construction levels. Species diversity followed the same pattern but took longer to reach the level of diversity recorded before construction. Pond surface area, depth and sun exposure were the most significant habitat characteristics explaining both amphibian species richness and diversity. Similarly, an increase in the number of vegetation strata was positively related to anuran species richness, indicating the need to maintain a heterogeneous landscape containing relatively large open wetland areas. 4. Synthesis and applications. We highlight the species-specific dynamics of the colonization process, including an increase in the number of replacement ponds inhabited over time by some species and, in some cases, an increase in population size. Our work suggests that successful replacement ponds can be designed around simple habitat features, providing clear benefits for a range of amphibian species, which will have positive cascading effects on local biodiversity. However, consideration must also be given to the terrestrial buffer zone when management strategies are being planned. Finally, our study offers insight into the successful establishment of anuran communities over a relatively short time in restored or replacement aquatic environments.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey is one of the most endangered primates in the world. It is experiencing a range of ongoing threats and the persisting effects of past disturbances. The prospects for this species are not very optimistic because habitat corridors are severely damaged by logging, grazing, and mining. Each group of the monkeys in different areas is facing a unique variety of threats. Based on genetic analysis, Rhinopithecus bieti should be separated into three management units for conservation, of which the Mt. Laojun management unit involves the most endangered primates. Despite the fact that the vegetation on Mt. Laojun is in a relatively pristine state, only two groups of monkeys, of a total of fewer than 300, survive in the area. With this paper, we aimed to address the capacity of the monkeys' habitat at the study site and the possible reasons for the small populations. Materials and methods Rapid ecological assessment based on a SPOT 5 image and field survey was used to simulate the vegetation of the whole area based on reference ecological factors of the GIS system. The vegetation map of the site was thus derived from this simulation. Based on the previous studies, the three vegetation types were identified as the suitable habitat of the monkeys. The confusion matrix-based field GPS points were applied to analyze the precision of the habitat map. Based on the map of suitable habitat of the monkeys, the utilization of the habitat and the carrying capacity were analyzed in the GIS. Results The confusion matrix-based field GPS points were applied to the habitat analysis process, and it was found that the habitat map was 81.3% precise. Then, with the current habitat map, we found that the mixed forest currently used by the monkeys is only a very small fraction (2.65%) of the overall potential habitat of the population, while the dark conifer forest is 4.09%. Discussion Poaching is the greatest short-term threat to this species, particularly in the southern range where local residents have a strong tradition of hunting. Quite a few individual monkeys are still trapped accidentally due to the high density of traps. These problems are hard to mitigate because it is difficult to enforce laws due to the extremely rugged terrain. Conclusions The results show that there is a great ecological capacity of the area for the monkey's survival and a great potential for an expansion of the monkey population at the site. Based on the current population and its geographical range, it can be estimated that the suitable habitat area defined by this study can support more monkeys, about many times the current population. Thus, at least in the Mt. Laojun Area, poaching pressure is the main factor to be responsible for the low density of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys instead of habitat alteration. Recommendations and perspectives Based on these results, some suggestions relating to conservation can be made: Focus conservation efforts on the current distribution area of the monkeys and create a 20 km buffer zone; design a long-term plan for the suitable habitat outside the buffer zone to set up a wildlife corridor in the long run; establish an association for the local hunters exploiting, their knowledge on the animals to promote monkey conservation and stop poaching. Also, the map derived from the study helps managers to allocate conservation resources more efficiently and enhances the overall outcomes of conservation measures.

AB  - Evergreen broad-leaved forest is now gradually degraded and fragmented, and there is an increase in the amount of habitat edges as a result of long-term human activity. However, the role of edges in the regeneration of primary forest species is poorly understood. After 20 years of the edge creation, we analyzed primary forest species distribution and abundance, and changes in floristic composition, vegetation structure across forest-field gradients in Ailao Mountain, SW China. Our results revealed that there was a higher abundance and richness of primary species, late secondary species and thorny lianas at the distances 0-50 m than at the distances more than 50 m from the edge into the forest exterior. At the distances >50 m, no individuals of dominant canopy trees Lithocarpus xylocarpus, Castanopsis wattii, and L. jingdongensis were found, whereas the abundance of early pioneer shrub species and herbaceous cover was significantly greater. The richness of primary species showed a decrease with increasing distances from the forest edge to the exterior, particularly of medium-seeded primary species showing a drastic decrease. Moreover, no large-seeded primary species occurred at the distances >60 m. This study indicates that the forest edge as a buffer zone may be in favor of primary species regeneration. A dense shrub and herb layer, and seed dispersal may be the major factors limiting the forest regeneration farther from the forest edge. Therefore, to facilitate forest recovery processes, management should give priority to the protection of buffer zones of this forest edge.

AB  - Prior to approval of commercialization, transgenic plants are required to be confined in order to prevent foreign gene dispersal. According to the current Chinese regulation of GMP biosafety assessment, the isolation distance for field experiment of GM rapeseed is 1 000 m, which is larger than required distance set by almost all countries and regions. According to the review of studies on rapeseed gene flow, the outcrossing rate of rapeseed (Brassica napus) is below 3%, and below 1% is the most cases. Isolation distance and buffer zone are effective ways to reduce outcrossing rate. Beyond 400 m the outcrossing rate becomes significantly lower than 0.01%, though it is much higher for the B. rapa, sterile lines and self-incompatible lines. It is suggested that biosafety management be based on the classification and threshold principles and that the isolation distance be adjusted to 400 m for common rapeseed varieties of B. napus while kept 1 000 m for the self-incompatible lines and sterile lines in the confined field experiment.

AB  - The structure and function of network is a central issue in landscape ecology. Road networks with hierarchical structure are crucial for understanding landscape dynamics. In this study, we compared the distribution of national road, provincial road, county road and rural road in the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) in Yunnan Province of China, and estimated the effect of roads (and other factors) on the spatial patterns of land use and land cover with logistic regression. In addition, we analyzed the land use and land cover change (LUCC) and landscape fragmentation in 1989–2005 along a buffer zone of the primary traffic corridor, national road G214. The results showed that, county and rural roads had much higher percentage of length extending into more natural habitats at higher elevation and steeper slope, compared with the higher level roads in this region. While the distributions of natural land cover types were dominated by environmental factors, human land use types i.e., building land and farmland types were significantly related with roads, linking more closely with lower level roads. The LUCC dynamics (1989–2005) of the G214 buffer zone showed a general trend of land transformation from conifer forests and valley arid shrubs to building land and farmland, and from ice and snow to alpine shrubs and forests. With the length of G214 unchanged during the time, the overall landscape pattern changed little in the buffer zone, but habitat fragmentation and area decrease had occurred for the natural vegetation types, in contrast to patch mergence and expansion of human land use types, and landscape fragmentation was intensified above 2500 m a.s.l. but declined below the elevation. The results indicated the dynamics of landscape composition and patch type level distribution in spite of the stability of the overall landscape pattern, and implied the potential role of roads, especially the low level roads on landscape changes.

AB  - Research at the University of Iowa is testing the ECOLOTREE BUFFER, a prototype wooded buffer strip planted between a creek and row-cropped land with roots grown intentionally deep enough to intersect the near-surface water table. This project demonstrates that Populus spp. trees cultured by using this technique are both ecologically sustaining and productive. Measured data prove that nitrate is removed from near-surface groundwater and that the nitrogen uptake is present as protein in the leaves and the woody stems. The tree's physiological attributes contribute to a harvested value that can "pay its way"; these include fast wood growth, cut-stem rooting, resprouting from a stump, phreatophytic roots, and a high protein content in the leaves. The wooded riparian strip changes the local agroecosystem by reducing fertilizer nutrients causing surface water eutrophication, by diversifying wildlife habitat, by reducing soils erosion caused by wind and water, by diversifying the crop base, by creating an aesthetic addition in the landscape. This idea is a potential technique for managing non-point source pollutants created by modern farming practices.

AB  - Rabies reappeared in Finland in the spring of 1988 after a 29-year absence. This time rabies occurred in sylvatic form and the major species involved was the raccoon dog. During the outbreak 1988–89 66 animals were diagnosed rabid. Vaccination of cats, cattle and horses was strongly recommended and vaccination of dogs was compulsory in the outbreak area. A field trial was started on oral immunisation of raccoon dogs and foxes against rabies using baits containing rabies vaccine strain. The outbreak area and a wide buffer zone were baited three times. Finland was declared free of rabies again in 1991. Oral vaccination campaign with vaccine baits has been organised along the southeastern border once a year since the beginning of 90s. Continuous surveillance and epidemiological screening is necessary to detect any new outbreaks of rabies at an early stage.

AB  - Pasture runoff can contribute to elevated concentrations of nutrients, solids, and bacteria in downstream waters. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of vegetative filter strip (VFS) length on concentrations and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, solids and fecal coliform in runoff from plots treated with cattle manure. Three plots with dimensions of 2.4 X 30.5 m were used. The upper 12.2 m of each plot was treated with cattle manure, while the lower 18.3 m acted as a VFS. Runoff produced by rainfall simulators was sampled at VFS lengths of 0, 6.1, 12.2, and 18.3 m and analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (N), ammonia N, nitrate N, total phosphorus (P), ortho-P, fecal coliforms, total suspended solids and other parameters. The VFS significantly reduced concentrations and mass transport of incoming solids, fecal coliform, and most nutrient forms, particularly P. The relationships among VFS length, concentration and mass transport were well-represented by first-order exponential decay functions. Approximately 75% of incoming total Kjeldahl N, total P, ortho-P, and total suspended solids was removed within the first 6.1 m of the filter strips. Runoff concentrations of fecal coliform concentrations entering the filter strips were as high as 2 X 10(7) FC/100 mL; after a filter length of 6.1 m, however, the runoff exhibited no measurable concentration of fecal coliforms. This experiment suggests that even relatively short filter strips can markedly improve quality of runoff from grassed areas receiving cattle manure.

AB  - Study the effect of conservation practices in agricultural land use on upland watershed was conducted during the year 1987-1993 at Amphoe Kao-Ko, Phetcharboon province. The area has elevation ranging between 600-700 m of mean sea level.Soil properties was in group soil no. 29 and 62. Three mini watersheds were selected for different conservation practices which are buffer strip, contouring and hillside ditch. The results were concluded that annual streamflow and subsurface flow were correlated with annual rainfall and rainfall distribution. The efficiency of these three systems of soil conservation practices are not significant in controlling soil erosion which not only the magnitude of soil loss are under the tolerable limit but also the streamflow quantity are equal in all water sheds. The intensive exploitation of agricultural land has caused decline not only annual streamflow but also subsurface flow. The rate of subsurface flow has 53 percent of total flow in the fifth year. But contouring conservation system can improve subsurface flow to more than 90 percent of total flow because of higher infiltration rate. Its amount has however declined after construction of contouring in 2.2 percent per year, and has become to 82 percent of total flow in 5 years. It was also found that soil erosion was increased with time after constructing contour which caused the rate of about 4 times of begining year in 5 years. The changes of land use from field crop to coffee orchards under soil conservation system as hillside ditch caused higher annual streamflow and decrease subsurface flow. The single conservation method without soil improvement program not being effectively conserved soil fertility.

AB  - In Taiwan, nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is one of the major causes of the impairment of surface waters. I-Liao Creek, located in southern Taiwan, flows approximately 90 km and drains toward the Kaoping River. Field investigation results indicate that NPS pollution from agricultural activities is one of the main water pollution sources in the I-Liao Creek Basin. Assessing the potential of NPS pollution to assist in the planning of best management practice (BMP) is significant for improving pollution prevention and control in the I-Liao Creek Basin. In this study, land use identification in the I-Liao Creek Basin was performed by properly integrating the skills of geographic information system (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS). In this analysis, 35 types of land use patterns in the watershed area of the basin are classified with the aid of Erdas Imagine® process system and ArcView® GIS system. Results indicate that betel palm farms, orchard farms, and tea gardens dominate the farmland areas in the basin, and are scattered around on both sides of the river corridor. An integrated watershed management model (IWMM) was applied for simulating the water quality and evaluating NPS pollutant loads to the I-Liao Creek. The model was calibrated and verified with collected water quality and soil data, and was used to investigate potential NPS pollution management plans. Simulated results indicate that NPS pollution has significant contributions to the nutrient loads to the I-Liao Creek during the wet season. Results also reveal that NPS pollution plays an important role in the deterioration of downstream water quality and caused significant increase in nutrient loads into the basin's water bodies. Simulated results show that source control, land use management, and grassy buffer strip are applicable and feasible BMPs for NPS nutrient loads reduction. GIS system is an important method for land use identification and waste load estimation in the basin. Linking the information of land utilization with the NPS pollution simulation model may further provide essential information of potential NPS pollution for all subregions in the river basin. Results and experience obtained from this study will be helpful in designing the watershed management and NPS pollution control strategies for other similar river basins.

AB  - The coastal planning has been developed in purpose of the ¡§safely¡¨, ¡§landscaping¡¨, ¡§ecology¡¨ and ¡§water affinity¡¨ in Taiwan nowadays. Moreover, the hendland bay beachs and beach nourishment have been hailed for the protection of shoreline. One of the main affection of erosion is a storm, which retreads shoreline and reduces nearshore by storm surge.This essay reports an application of 2-D SBEACH software to simulate the beach profile changes. The data of large wave tank (LWT), which tests by the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC), US Army Corps of Engineers, is used to calibrate the parameters by SBEACH. Then, using the results of experimentation to indicate the accuracy of model from Grosser Wellen Kanal (GWK), which tests by the University of Hannor. Finally, simulating beach profile, with a berm (height of 2.5m and width of 100m) and a slope of 1:25, is used to simulate the profile changes and analyze the results by different storm conditions from CECI. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the suitable distance of shoreline and location of bar for a beach buffer zone by SBEACH during different storm conditions.The present study confirms that the simulated results of shoreline erosion rate and the position of bar crest by SBEACH comform to the LWT and GWK experiments. The major parameters of SBEACH, the transport rate coefficient, K influences the sediment transport, coefficient for slope-dependent term, £` controls the slope of beach profile and shape of bar, the transport rate decay coefficient multiplier, Kb affects the shoreline erosion, and the landward surf zone depth, db influences the shape of berm. The result of analysis by SBEACH indicates that a constant slope beach profile changes by different storm conditions and the extent of non-dimensional shoreline retreat Xt/Lo is found in good linear relationship with deepwater wave steepness Ho/Lo. Therefore, the linear regress function is used to compute the less beach buffer zone in different storm conditions.

AB  - Regional ecological degradation induced by hydroelectric project construction (HPC) is of great concern in the field of landscape ecology research. Using GIS-based spatial analysis, we predicted and assessed the impacts of HPC on the ecological integrity of the Nuozhadu Nature Reserve (NNR). The results show that, after Nuozhadu HPC, the naturality of the NNR will be modified due to changes in the landscape composition such that larger areas covered by vegetation will be occupied by construction land and flooded by water areas. Meanwhile, landscape diversity will increase due to the additional landscape types of construction land and submerged areas, while landscape stability will decrease because of the splitting and contagion of the landscape after Nuozhadu HPC. The human disturbance index shows that the HPC will contribute to increasing the disturbance of the ecosystem. From buffer analyses, we conclude that the impacts of HPC will mainly occur in buffer zones over the distance of 800 m from the Lancang River in the NNR, and tend to be moderate in the 800–5,000 m buffer zone. Therefore, within the 800 m buffer zone, taking the naturality, diversity and stability of the ecosystem as well as anthropogenic interference as evaluation indicators, we calculated the ecological integrity index; the results indicate that the ecological integrity of the NNR will decrease by 7.6 % after project construction.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a process-based, watershed-scale model with a hydrologic response unit (HRU) as the basic computation element, which makes it difficult to accurately represent riparian buffers using their physical parameters (e.g., vegetation structure). On the other hand, the field-scale Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) provides the opportunity to consider details of hydrologic processes within a riparian buffer zone. However, the runoff and its associated constituents from the upland area that is hydraulically connected to the riparian buffer zone must be provided as inputs into REMM. The rationale proposed here is that the integration of SWAT and REMM would improve the assessment of riparian buffers, which is vital to watershed management but which has not been described in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop a GIS interface that integrated SWAT and REMM for estimating water quality benefits of riparian buffers in agricultural watersheds. For modeling purposes, the interface subdivided a watershed into a number of sub-basins, each of which was further subdivided into drainage areas of isolated impoundments (e.g., wetlands), concentrated flow, and riparian buffers using available GIS data. As a result, riparian buffers received runoff and associated pollutants from corresponding contribution areas to mimic actual field conditions. The interface facilitated transferring the SWAT outputs into REMM and computing the site characteristic parameters (e.g., length and width) of the riparian buffers. The outputs from subsequent REMM runs were in turn taken as inputs into SWAT for channel routing and further simulation. The interface was used to assess water quality benefits of riparian buffers in the Lower Canagagigue Creek watershed located in southern Ontario, Canada. The results indicated that the existing riparian buffer system achieved a 27.9% abatement in sediment and a 37.4% reduction in total phosphorus. The model runs demonstrated that the GIS interface was easy to use and could serve as a protocol for integrating models with distinctly different spatial scales.

AB  - A growing share of water pollution in the U.S. can be attributed to nonpoint sources (USEPA 2002). Some of this trend can be attributed to declining point source (PS) emissions as a result of regulation under the Clean Water Act (CWA). However, fertilizer-intensive practices used to improve agricultural productivity over recent decades have also increased nitrate loads and resulted in water quality impairments.Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from agricultural practices is generally exempt from federal regulation. However, some voluntary programs allow point sources subject to the CWA’s effluent limitations to meet their standards by purchasing offset credits reflecting reductions in NPS discharges to the same waters (USEPA 2004). Such water quality trading (WQT) programs have been implemented in a number of states to reduce pollution abatement costs (Breetz et al 2004). In this setting, NPS supply pollution abatement when they implement best management practices (BMP) that reduce nutrient loads, and the cost of BMPs form a supply curve for credits. WQT programs are supported by the EPA as an important means for efficiently pursuing water quality goals (USEPA 2003a).Among the BMPs available for water quality management, riparian buffer strips have proven effective in mitigating the movement of nutrients and other pollutants into surface waters (Qiu et al 2006). Estimates of riparian buffer costs would be valuable for developing policy related to WQT and other conservation programs. This paper estimates the annual costs of buffer strips in six counties in the Lower Kentucky River Basin, as part of a project evaluating the feasibility of WQT programs in that area.

AB  - The testing of transgenic crops in the field is a necessary part of the validation of genetically engineered cultivars, but in the early stages of testing, biosafety procedures must be carefully monitored to ensure that the modified plants do not have deleterious effects on the environment. This study was carried out over two seasons to determine the effectiveness of containment procedures under australian environmental conditions by measuring the dispersal of pollen away from a test plot of transgenic cotton into a surrounding buffer field of non-transgenic cotton plants whose function was to act as a sink for pollen carried by nectar feeding and pollen-gathering insects. Dispersal was estimated by measuring the frequency of the dominant selectable marker transgene, neomycin phosphotransferase (NptII) in the progeny of the buffer plants. The presence of nptii was determined by a sensitive radioactive enzyme assay. Pollen dispersal was low in both years, but increased with an increase in the size of the source plot in the second year. In the first year outcrossing averaged from 0.15% of progeny at 1 m to below 0.08% at 4 m from the test plot. Outcrossing was highest within the central test plot where progeny from non-transgenic control plants, immediately adjacent to transgenic plants, had transgenic progeny at frequencies of up to 1.7%. In the second year, with a bigger source of transgenic plants, outcrossing declined on average from 0.4% at 1 m to below 0.03% at 16 m into the buffer zone. These results indicate that 20 m buffer zones would serve to limit dispersal of transgenic pollen from small-scale field tests.

AB  - Under the Clean Water Act, U.S. states are required to establish water quality standards, list impaired waterbodies and create Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for impaired waters. Sediment contributes greatly to the water impairment in Tennessee, with agriculture often cited as the primary source. The watershed (catchment) in our study, Pond Creek, is listed as impaired for sediment and will require a TMDL and watershed restoration plan in the near future. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has developed an Integrated Pollutant Source Identification tool, consisting of aerial photographs, GIS database, and set of analysis spreadsheets to help plan watershed restoration efforts. We used this tool to assess sediment delivery from pastures, soil loss from eroding streambanks and riparian buffer condition in Pond Creek Watershed. We found that the user-friendly IPSI tool provides excellent maps and tables that can be used to educate farmers and other interested citizens, and to identify key restoration efforts.

AB  - A discrete/continuous model of participation in environmental programs is developed. A conditional expectation correction model is used to overcome the selectivity bias inherent in single-equation approaches used to describe participation. The two-equation model proposed explicitly recognizes the linkage between the discrete decision (participate or not) and the continuous decision (level of participation for enrollees). This approach yields a measure of willingness to accept payment for program participation that is not obtainable when level of participation alone is considered. A moel using contingent valuation survey data assessing participation in the filter strip program in Michigan serves as an example

AB  - The drift of fluorescent tracer in water and formulated pesticide sprays was measured at different heights and distances within 6-m-wide buffer strips ("Conservation Headlands") and field boundaries surrounding mature winter cereal fields. Spray deposits were taken from artificial collectors. There was a diminution in deposition at the hedgerow, where a 6-m-wide buffer strip of unsprayed crop was employed between the sprayer and the hedgerow compared to where the entire crop edge was fully sprayed. There was some evidence that a mature crop would absorb some of this spray drift, reducing deposition on the hedge flora below crop level and, therefore, the nature of the buffer strip as well as it's width were thought to be important in determining hedgerow deposition rates. Frequency distributions of deposition along strips of hedgerow revealed that the unsprayed buffer zone also served to reduce the peaks in drift that might occur as a result of the pitch and yaw of travelling tractor booms. The vegetational complexity of the hedge bottom was also shown to determine spray deposition within field boundaries. Larvae of the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris brassicae[L.]) showed higher mortalities when exposed to hedgerow grasses adjacent to conventionally sprayed headlands compared to those adjacent to a Conservation Headland. A simple methodology for spray deposition studies is outlined, and implications of pesticide drift into field boundaries discussed

AB  - 1. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of riparian buffers in the tropics, despite their potential to reduce the impacts of deforestation on stream communities. We examined macroinvertebrate assemblages and stream habitat characteristics in small lowland streams in southeastern Costa Rica to assess the impacts of deforestation on benthic communities and the influence of riparian forest buffers on these effects. Three different stream reach types were compared in the study: (i) forested reference reaches, (ii) stream reaches adjacent to pasture with a riparian forest buffer at least 15 m in width on both banks and (iii) stream reaches adjacent to pasture without a riparian forest buffer. 2. Comparisons between forest and pasture reaches suggest that deforestation, even at a very local scale, can alter the taxonomic composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, reduce macroinvertebrate diversity and eliminate the most sensitive taxa. The presence of a riparian forest buffer appeared to significantly reduce the effects of deforestation on benthic communities, as macroinvertebrate diversity and assemblage structure in forest buffer reaches were generally very similar to those in forested reference reaches. One forest buffer reach was clearly an exception to this pattern, despite the presence of a wide riparian buffer. 3. The taxonomic structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages differed between pool and riffle habitats, but contrasts among the three reach types in our study were consistent across the two habitats. Differences among reach types also persisted across three sampling periods during our 15-month study. 4. Among the environmental variables we measured, only stream water temperature varied significantly among reach types, but trends in periphyton abundance and stream sedimentation may have contributed to observed differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. 5. Forest cover was high in all of our study catchments, and more research is needed to determine whether riparian forest buffers will sustain similar functions in more extensively deforested landscapes. Nevertheless, our results provide support for Costa Rican regulations protecting riparian forests and suggest that proper riparian management could significantly reduce the impacts of deforestation on benthic communities in tropical streams.

AB  - Managed riparian forest buffers are an important conservation practice but there are little data on the water quality effects of buffer management. We measured surface runoff volumes and nutrient concentrations and loads in a riparian buffer system consisting of (moving down slope from the field) a grass strip, a managed forest, and an unmanaged forest. The managed forest consisted of sections of clear-cut, thinned, and mature forest. The mature forest had significantly lower flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), sediment TKN, total N (nitrate + TKN), dissolved molybdate reactive P (DMRP), total P, and chloride. The average buffer represented the conditions along a stream reach with a buffer system in different stages of growth. Compared with the field output, flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, DMRP, and total P decreased significantly within the buffer and flow-weighted concentrations of TKN, total N, and chloride increased significantly within the buffer. All loads decreased significantly from the field to the middle of the buffer, but most loads increased from the middle of the buffer to the sampling point nearest the stream because surface runoff volume increased near the stream. The largest percentage reduction of the incoming nutrient load (at least 65% for all nutrient forms) took place in the grass buffer zone because of the large decrease (68%) in flow. The average buffer reduced loadings for all nutrient species, from 27% for TKN to 63% for sediment P. The managed forest and grass buffer combined was an effective buffer system.

AB  - The effect of a riparian forest buffer system (RFBS) on transport of two herbicides, atrazine and alachlor, was studied during 1992-1994. Herbicides were applied to an upland corn crop in March of each year. The buffer system was managed based on USDA recommendations and averaged 50 m in width. The system included a grass buffer strip immediately adjacent to the field (Zone 3); a managed pine forest downslope from the grass buffer (Zone 2); and a narrow hardwood forest containing the stream channel system (Zone 1). After the first year of the study, the managed forest was clear-cut in 1/3 and thinned in 1/3 of Zone 2. The other 1/3 of Zone 2 was left as mature forest. Most of the herbicide transport in surface runoff occurred before 30 June with about 25 cm of cumulative rainfall after herbicide application. During this period of higher herbicide transport, atrazine and concentrations averaging 34.1 micrograms L-1 and 9.1 micrograms L-1 at the field edge, respectively, were reduced to 1 microgram L-1 or less as runoff neared the stream. There were generally no differences among the mature forest and the two treatment areas (clear-cut and thinned) for either concentration or load in surface runoff. Using precipitation data collected on site, the effects of dilution versus other concentration reduction factor (infiltration, adsorption) was estimated for surface runoff. Concentration reduction was greatest per meter of flow length in the grass buffer adjacent to the field. There was only minor transport of herbicides through the buffer system in shallow groundwater and little difference between the Zone 2 treatment areas. In 1992 and 1993, herbicide concentrations in shallow groundwater in the RFBS and at the edge-of-field were generally at or below detection limits. In 1994, well concentrations of both herbicides increased, probably in response to infiltration of surface runoff containing high herbicide concentrations. Average herbicide concentrations were at or below

AB  - A field study was conducted to determine the effect of landscape spatial pattern and micro-topography on nutrient transfer via runoff from two catchments into Yuqiao Reservoir in north China. The surface runoff discharge was measured during rainfall events and water samples were analyzed in 2004 and 2005. The mean annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) exports per unit area from Caogezhuang catchment (C catchment) were 1.048 and 0.561 kg ha-¹ year-¹, respectively, while the TN and TP exports from Taohuasi catchment (T catchment) were 0.158 and 0.027 kg ha-¹ year-¹. In both catchments, village and vineyard shared the highest nutrient export ability due to the accumulated animal waste and heavy application of fertilizer and manure. In T catchment, the distance of village and vineyard was about 1,500 m away from the receiving water and in between were woodland and cropland. In the hydrological pathway, there were sink landscape structures of small stone dams, roadside swale, vegetated filter strip and dry ponds, which could detain water and nutrients. In C catchment, the distance between the village and the receiving water was about 200 m, and the hydrological pathway was compacted roads and ditches with no sink structures. It is suggested that the distance between the pollution source area and the receiving water and the micro-topographical features were the main factors to control the great difference in nutrient export rates.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of atrazine in runoff waters from areas cultivated with corn, utilizing 0, 5 and 10 m length vegetative filter strips. The runoff was generated by 4 simulated rains. The filter strips were cultivated with Brachiaria decumbens, which acts as an atrazine retention element. The 5 m length filter had 73,8% reduction of atrazine compared to control (without filter). The 10 m width filter had a reduction of 89,7%. These percentages of reduction were obtained due to an increase of water infiltration in the filter soil. The experiment demonstrated an efficient reduction of atrazine diluted in water, although the concentration did not suffer important reduction.

AB  - In this study, prey composition and numbers of prey ingested by orb-web spiders (actual prey), as well as the food resources available in the habitat (potential prey), the retention efficiency of spider webs, and the prey selectivity of spiders, which bias the prey composition, were investigated for the garden spider Araneus diadematus and the wasp-like spider Argiope bruennichi in two field margin habitats in Bavaria, South Germany. The potential prey of both spider species on field margins consisted of a few flying prey taxa with a dominance of Diptera. In spider webs, mobile Diptera and some Hymenoptera were underestimated whereas small, broad-winged prey items such as Sternorrhyncha were overestimated compared to the composition of potential prey. Spiders avoided prey groups armed with strong mandibles or stings, such as Coleoptera and some Hymenoptera. A mean number of nine prey items in 7 h was consumed by orb-web spiders in field margin habitats consisting mainly of Diptera and herbivorous pest groups such as Sternorrhyncha.

AB  - Concerns have been raised that genetically modified Bt maize may harm non-target organisms, and there is a general call and need for a risk assessment of Bt maize. Spiders are important pest predators in agroecosystems and in maize, and can be exposed to the Bt toxin by herbivorous or pollen-collecting prey, by active Bt maize pollen feeding, and by ingesting their pollen-dusted webs. The foliage-dwelling spider fauna of Bt maize fields and adjacent margins was monitored and compared to non-transgenic maize fields. The study took place during the vegetation seasons of 2001-2003 in Bavaria, South Germany. Maize fields and adjacent nettle field margins were colonized by a typical spider assemblage, dominated by space-web spiders (Theridiidae and Linyphiidae). Abundance and species richness of spiders was higher in nettle margins than in maize fields. The proportion of hunting spiders tended to be higher in nettle margins, whereas space-web spiders tended to be more frequent in maize fields. Bt maize showed no consistent effect on individual numbers, species richness and guild structure of spiders in maize fields and adjacent nettle field margin strips. The spider abundance was higher in Bt treatments in 2003, whereas in 2001 and 2002 no significant differences were found. The results provide an important contribution for the implementation of case-specific and general surveillance of transgenic plants to be employed due to the regulations of the European Community.

AB  - Pb and Cd concentrations in the habitat and preys of the red-crowned crane (i.e., reed rhizomes and three typical aquatic animal families (Perccottus glehni Dybowski, Carassius auratus Linnaeus, and Viviparidae)) were analyzed to examine the impact of these hazards on red-crowned cranes in northeastern China. Results indicated that Pb and Cd concentrations in the preys of the red-crowned cranes were elevated via food chain. Most of the detected Pb and Cd contents in the sediments were above the natural background level, ranging from 9.85 to 129.72� ppm and 1.23 to 10.63� ppm (dry weight), respectively. Cd geo-accumulation index at all sites were larger than 3, even reached 5.22, suggesting serious pollution in this region. Three common water animal families were detected to contain heavy metals, following the order of increasing concentrations: primary consumers (i.e., Viviparidae and Carassius auratus Linnaeus) < secondary consumers (i.e., Perccottus glehni Dybowski). Pb and Cd concentrations in the buffer zone are significantly higher than in the core area and being elevated in the food chain. The molten feathers of the red-crowned cranes showed the highest toxic metal concentrations of Pb (2.09 to 5.81� ppm) and Cd (1.42 to 3.06� ppm) compared with the feces produced by cranes and residual eggshell left by water fowls. Exceptionally high Pb and Cd concentrations in the cranes and their preys were thought to be associated with their habitat.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated for hydrology conditions in an agricultural watershed of Orestimba Creek, California, and applied to simulate fate and transport of two organophosphate pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon. The model showed capability in evaluating pesticide fate and transport processes in agricultural fields and instream network. Management-oriented sensitivity analysis was conducted by applied stochastic SWAT simulations for pesticide distribution. Results of sensitivity analysis identified the governing processes in pesticide outputs as surface runoff, soil erosion, and sedimentation in the study area. By incorporating sensitive parameters in pesticide transport simulation, effects of structural best management practices (BMPs) in improving surface water quality were demonstrated by SWAT modeling. This study also recommends conservation practices designed to reduce field yield and in-stream transport capacity of sediment, such as filter strip, grassed waterway, crop residue management, and tailwater pond to be implemented in the Orestimba Creek watershed. Selected structural BMPs are recommended for reducing loads of OP pesticides.

It has been shown that, despite a five- to eightfold decrease in the amount of emissions due to production downscaling, digression processes in V. myrtillus cenopopulations are still ongoing in the impact zone. In the buffer zone, however, positive shifts in the structural organization of cenopopulations are observed.

AB  - Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) play a key role within agricultural systems as pollinators of crops and wild flowers. However, this taxon has suffered severe declines as a result of agricultural intensification. Conservation efforts largely focus on providing forage resources for bumblebees through the summer, but providing suitable habitat during the period of nest foundation in early spring could be a more effective method of boosting local bumblebee populations. This study assesses the attractiveness of three different farmland habitat types (hedgerow, field margin and grassland), and the relative merits of respective land management prescriptions under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme to nest site searching and foraging bumblebee queens during the period of queen emergence and colony foundation. Hedgerows were the least attractive habitat type to spring queens. Rural Stewardship species-rich grassland comprised a complex vegetation structure attracting nest site searching queens, whilst grassland that had been abandoned allowing natural regeneration contained more flowers, attracting foraging queens. Field margin habitats were the most attractive habitat type, and Rural Stewardship field margins attracted both nest site searching and foraging queens at relatively high densities. This management option consisted of a sown grass mix, giving rise to the complex vegetation structure preferred by nest site searching queens, but regular disturbance allowed invasion by early flowering bumblebee forage plants. These findings suggest that it should be possible to develop simple combined management strategies to provide both suitable nesting sites and spring forage resources on farmland, promoting bumblebee colony foundation and therefore abundance in the agricultural environment.

AB  - To increase the food production in Lampung Province, Way Rarem irrigation project was developed to irrigate about 22.000 hectares of rice fields. The research purposes are to know the functions of Way Rarem both in irrigation and tourism development, and to study the impact of the management of buffer zone environment towards the Way Rarem reservoir and to study the impact of the Way Rarem reservoir towards the social culture in the community around it. The results of the research show that the Way Rarem reservoir does not optimally function both on the irrigation and the tourism development area. This is caused by the social cultural condition of the community around it who does not fully support the maintenance and existence of the reservoir.

AB  - Stream temperature impacts resulting from forest harvesting in riparian areas have been documented in a number of locations in North America. As part of the Stuart-Takla Fisheries-Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.

AB  - The model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate alternative scenarios of land use in Ribeirão dos Marins watershed, in Piracicaba, State of São Paulo, Brazil, for the biennial period 1999/2000. Two scenarios were simulated. The first one (scenario 1) was based on the current land use except for the introduction of a continuous riparian buffer of 30 m along the drainage network and of 50 m around the springs, in accordance to Brazil's environmental legislation. In the second (scenario 2) the steepest slopes (30.9 % of the watershed area) with high erosive potential, covered by pasture, were substituted by native forest. The two simulated scenarios were compared to the current one in relation to sediment yield. The scenarios brought forth different spatial patterns of sediment yield. A reduction of 94,0 % in sediment yield was obtained by the substitution of pasture with native vegetation (scenario 2), and of 10.8 % in scenario 1. These results showed that it is necessary to manage landscape aspects of watersheds comprehensively, identifying the environmentally most sensitive areas, mainly in relation to erosion, instead of protecting only the riparian areas.

AB  - The abundance of a beneficial syrphid species along two strips of an arable field margin with contrasting floral richness were assessed to determine how the strips attracted and retained Episyrphus balteatus, whose larvae are aphidophagous. One margin strip was supplemented by eight species of flowering plants, planted between the hedgerow and the arable crop. E. balteatus was observed foraging on all eight species at this florally rich strip. A control strip had no additional floral resources other than those naturally present. E. balteatus was significantly more abundant at the rich strip over 21 trapping days. The effectiveness of each strip to retain. E. balteatus was assessed by observing and recording the time spent by paint marked individuals within each strip. The rate of dispersal of E. balteatus from each strip was determined from the percentage of marked individuals remaining in a strip over time. Data from trapping E. balteatus, and from determining their dispersal rates from the strips were used in a simple mathematical expression to show that E. balteatus were attracted into the rich strip more than the control strip on nine study days during the first half of the investigation. E. balteatus dispersed significantly more slowly from the rich strip on nine study days during the second half of the study. Managing hedgerows and fieldmargins to create florally rich habitats to attract and retain E. balteatus is an option farmers can consider if E. balteatus is to be encouraged into fields as part of a system of integrated pest management.

AB  - The research and determining zonation of conservation area had been conducted in Marine National Park of Teluk Cenderawasih during 1996-1997. Since declared by Minister of Forestry as Marine National Park of Teluk Cenderawasih in 1993, this conservation area has still had no zonation yet. The objective of this research is to formulate zonation in Marine National Park of Teluk Cenderawasih base an (a) its potency of biodiversity (b) social economic condition and local culture that tradionally laid on natural resources. It is expected that the result of this formulation can be used as references in order to determine zone. The result shows that based on potency of natural resorce and its social culture, Marine National Park of Teluk Cenderawasih can be divided into five zones, those are (a) core zone covering Matas Island, Nuburi Islan and tridacna Islands, (b) limited use zone covering Nusrowi Island, Papaya Island. Roon Island and Rumberpoon Island, (c) buffer zone, covering all areas out side conservation area, (d) rehabilitation zone covering Kumbur Island, Roswar Island and Yuriari, and (e) traditional used zone covering all areas that not include point (a), (b), (c) and (d). It is suggested that the above recommended zone is need tobe implemented in the field immediately, because in some locations the condition of coral reef has more and more damaging

AB  - The research had been conducted on July 1998 at some places within the area of Wasur National Park, Merauke, Irian Jaya. The objective of this research is to obtain data and information about its natural resources potential and social condition of indigenous people living within the area as a base of Wasur National Park zoning. Exploration in Line Plot Sampling is used to collect data about flora and fauna, while social condition of people is approached by Rapid Rural Appraisal Technique. Based on data analysis, it can be considered to divide the area into three main zones e.i. (i) Central Zone as source of animal feed, especially for kangaroo (Macropus agills) and deer (Cervus timorensis) and also as a sacred place for indigenous people; (ii) Utilization Zone where indigenous people live and fulfill their need of food; (iii) Buffer Zone includes borderlines about three kilometers in width

AB  - This paper studied the high temperature self-propagating synthesis of W–Ni graded alloy under ultra-high gravity field. The evolution of composition and microstructure along ultra-high gravity direction was investigated. In this W–Ni alloy, ultra-high reaction temperature resulted in the production of stable ordered Ni₄W phase, and ultra-high gravity field promoted the formation of W–Ni graded alloy. Composition and microstructure exhibited a graded variation along the ultra-high gravity direction, and three functional gradients formed on the cross section. The Ni-rich layer was mainly enhanced by the Ni₄W phase, while the W-rich layer was primarily reinforced by the W particles. Between them, the transitional layer served as the buffer zone of thermal expansion to relax the thermal stress.

AB  - Veredas (palm swamps) are wetland complexes associated with the Brazilian savanna (cerrado) that often represent the only available source of water for the ecosystem during the dry months. Their extent and condition are mainly unknown and their cartography is an essential issue for their protection. This research article evaluates some of the fine resolution satellite data both in the radar (Radarsat-1) and optical domain (ASTER) for the delineation and characterization of veredas. Two separate approaches are evaluated. First, given the known potential of Radarsat-1 images for wetland inventories, the automatic delineation of veredas is tested using only Radarsat-1 data and a Markov random fields region-based segmentation. In this case, to increase performance, processing is limited to a buffer zone around the river network. Then, characterization of their type is attempted using traditional classification methods of ASTER optical data combined with Radarsat-1 data. The automatic classification of Radarsat data yielded results with an overall accuracy between 62 and 69%, that proved reliable enough for delineating wide and very humid veredas. Scenes from the wet season and with a smaller angle of incidence systematically yielded better results. For the classification of the main vegetation types, better results (overall success of 78.8%) were obtained by using only the visible and near infrared (VNIR) bands of the ASTER image. Radarsat data did not bring any improvement to these classification results. In fact, when using solely the Radarsat data from two different angle of incidence and two different dates, the classification results were low (50.8%) but remained powerful for delineating the permanently moist riparian forest portion of the veredas with an accuracy better than 75% in most cases. These results are considered good given the width of some types often less than 50 m wide compared with the resolution of the images (12.5 - 15 m). Comparing the classification results with the Radarsat-generated delineation allows an understanding of the relation between synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering and vegetation types of the veredas.

AB  - Citrus indica and C. macroptera are the wild endangered species of Citrus occurring in northeastern India. Surveys were undertaken in this region for ascertaining distribution, studying variability and for collection of germplasm of these two species. C. indica, an endemic species of this region, was collected from the Citrus Gene Sanctuary located in buffer zone of Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in the Garo hills of Meghalaya. In addition, a putative natural hybrid of C. indica and C. limon was collected for the first time from the south Garo hills. C. macroptera had much wider distribution and was collected from Mizoram and Meghalaya states. In Jantia hills of Meghalaya, natural populations of this species are in a highly threatened state. The two species were unevenly distributed all over the explored territory. Morphological characterization of leaves, fruits and seeds indicated the presence of sizable variability within collected accessions of these two Citrus species. Indigenous technical knowledge gathered on the use and socio-economic importance indicated commercial potential for these two species in northeastern India. However, lack of cultivation of these species and clearing of forest cover at an alarming rate has led to an urgent need to adopt complementary conservation strategies to safeguard these species and to ensure their availability for future utilization. A major emphasis on developing methods for their propagation, multiplication and regeneration in in situ and ex situ conditions is required.

AB  - Ten years after the large-scale tsetse control campaigns in the important cattle rearing areas of the Faro and Deo Division of the Adamaoua Plateau in Cameroon, the seasonal distribution and abundance of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) were determined. During a period of 12 consecutive months (January-December 2005), the tsetse population was monitored along four trap transects consisting of a total of 32 traps and two flyround transects traversing the study area, which comprised the tsetse-infested valley, a buffer zone and the supposedly tsetse-free plateau. Throughout the study period, a total of 2195 Glossina morsitans submorsitans and 23 Glossina tachinoides were captured in the traps and 1007 G. m. submorsitans (78.8% male flies) were captured along the flyround transects. All G. tachinoides and almost all G. m. submorsitans were captured in the valley. Five G. m. submorsitans were captured in traps located in the buffer zone, whereas no flies were captured in traps located on the plateau. The index of apparent abundance (IAA) of G. m. submorsitans was substantially higher in the areas close to game reserves. In the remaining part of the valley, where wildlife is scarce and cattle are present during transhumance (dry season), the IAA of tsetse was substantially lower. In this part of the valley, the abundance of tsetse seemed to be associated with the presence of cattle, with the highest IAA during transhumance when cattle are present and the lowest apparent abundance during the rainy season when cattle have moved to the plateau. It is concluded that the distribution of tsetse in a large part of the valley undergoes substantial seasonal changes depending on the presence or absence of cattle. The repercussions of those findings for the control of tsetse in the valley and the probability of reinvasion of the plateau are discussed.

AB  - As a straightforward method of assessing on-farm biodiversity, plant species numbers were compared in a fixed sampling area for each type of habitat distinguished independent of farm size and applicable for comparing different farm strategies. Using the species-area relationship, the minimum sampling areas were determined. For ditch banks, crops and field margin strips sampling areas of 400 m2 (independent of the ditch bank width), 100 and 25 m2, respectively, were proposed. Indicator threshold values for conventional farms were defined based on the best 10% of the variation in species richness among farms. With appropriate farm management these targets could be achieved. In comparison to ditch banks, crops and sown field margin strips were relatively poor in plant species. The respective numbers of naturally occurring plant species found in crops and field margin were both significantly smaller than those found in ditch banks. In contrast, ecological management of ditch banks appeared to be a promising means of increasing species richness.

AB  - The soil in the study area was tentatively named the Lugo series. It occurs on hilly landscape and is evaluated as severely eroded. The soil is a member of the family of fine claying, montmorillonitic, isohyperthermic, vertic arguidolls. It is found suitable for ipil-ipil but required phosphorus fertilization. Soil erosion, low soil fertility and low productivity were the major farming problems observed in the study area. Natural leveling of the area between buffer strips, cash income from sales of leaves, increased soil fertility from green manure and control of gully erosion were some of the immediate measureable benefits from ipil-ipil buffer strip. The annual dried leaf production of ipil-ipil buffer strip was computed to be 1206 kg per hectare. The nutrient content of the dried ipil-ipil leaves was 4.15% nitrogen, 0.35% phosphorus and 1.38% pot1125assium while the midribs contained 2.12% nitrogen, 0.34% phosphorus and 1.70% potassium. Improvement of farming practices on account of introduction of ipil-ipil buffer strip include plowing along contour. Composting of straws and grasses and minimum tillage. The study also found out that green manuring is more economical than selling the ipil-ipil lea

AB  - The landscape surrounding a particular stream or river has a complex relationship with the aquatic habitat, influencing ecological health on multiple scales. Alteration of the landscape through anthropogenic activity represents a primary threat to rivers and streams via a variety of mechanisms, including habitat loss, nutrient enrichment, pollution, riparian zone and canopy destruction, and alteration of hydrology. Nutrient enrichment in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus is associated with eutrophication, increased primary productivity, decreased biodiversity, and hypoxia in both freshwater and marine environments. Nitrate retention and loss can be controlled by several factors, including a variety of biological mechanisms by which nitrogen is temporarily or permanently removed from agriculturally impacted subsurface waterways. A dominant sink for nitrate is denitrification, carried out exclusively by denitrifying bacteria. Denitrifiers are able to reduce nitrate to nitrous oxide or di-nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions, thus removing nitrate permanently from the system. Although the process of denitrification in streams is well studied, it is unclear how varying hydrologic regimes in agriculturally impacted streams and riparian buffer zones affect the denitrifying community’s structure. In this study, the effect of varying hydrologic regimes on microbial community composition and denitrification rates in agriculturally impacted streams was examined. The role of flooding in driving microbial community composition and denitrification rates of naturally formed riparian benches along a primary headwater agricultural stream was also examined via a simulated flooding experiment. Results suggest that hydrology plays a significant role in determining denitrification rate, likely due to changes in sediment and soil redox potentials. Results also suggest that bacterial community structure (i.e. 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, nosZ gene copy numbers, and relative denitrifier abundance) is not a good predictor of changes in denitrification rate and subsequent nitrate removal.

AB  - Riparian buffer forests and vegetative filter strips are widely recommended for improving surface water quality, but grass-shrub riparian buffer system (RBSs) are less well studied. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of buffer width and vegetation type on the key processes and overall reductions of total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) from simulated runoff passed through established (7-year old) RBSs. Nine 1-m RBS plots, with three replicates of three vegetation types (all natural selection grasses, two-segment buffer with native grasses and plum shrub, and two-segment buffer with natural selection grasses and plum shrub) and widths ranging from 8.3 to 16.1 m, received simulated runoff having 4,433 mg/l TSS from on-site soil, 1.6 mg/l total P, and 20 mg/l total N. Flow-weighted samples were collected by using Runoff Sampling System (ROSS) units. The buffers were very efficient in removal of sediments, N, and P, with removal efficiencies strongly linked to infiltration. Mass and concentration reductions averaged 99.7% and 97.9% for TSS, 91.8% and 42.9% for total P, and 92.1% and 44.4% for total N. Infiltration alone could account for >75% of TSS removal, >90% of total P removal, and >90% of total N removal. Vegetation type induced significant differences in removal of TSS, total P, and total N. These results demonstrate that adequately designed and implemented grass-shrub buffers with widths of only 8 m provide for water quality improvement, particularly if adequate infiltration is achieved.

AB  - Experimental field control of the Oriental fruit fly Dacus dorsalis Hendel was done by alternating male annihilation and sterile fly releases in a mixed orchard at San Jose del Monte, Bulacan [Philippines] from 1981-1987. The orchard was saturated with 600 poisoned methyl sugenol traps and partially isolated from neighboring farms by a 10-m buffer zone. About 35,000 sterile flies were released weekly during months when field population was low. For comparison, a series of 50 fly traps was maintained in a control area located at Dasmarinas, Cavite [Philippines]. Results of a continuous application of the integrated approach showed consistently lower fly population and lower fruit infestation in the experimental than in the control area. Also, collection of fallen fruits prevented possible source of infestation, thereby maintaining a clean culture in the orchard. Thus, implementation of the integrated fruit fly control program should be conducted in a pilot scale in mango or other fruit areas in the country.

AB  - Changes in edaphic carabidofauna abundance in a wheat crop plot, its field margins, and four semi-natural adjacent habitats were evaluated. A low specific richness of carabids was found in the wheat crop. No species was found exclusively in the wheat plot, but there were species found in the surrounding habitat. The observed responses of different species regarding moisture conditions determined their presence or absence in these semi-natural habitats as well as in dominance structures of each particular ambient. A gradual decrease in the number of captured individuals from the field margin to the center of the wheat plot was observed. Semi-natural habitats and field margins become an important requirement for habitat and shelter of the best represented species of ground beetles, particularly for predatory and omnivorous varieties.

AB  - A new theoretical and experimental framework that permits an accurate determination of aggregate-size stability distribution is presented. The size-stability distribution in addition to estimating aggregate-size distribution distinguishes between amounts of stable and unstable macroaggregates (>250 micrometer). The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized in terms of their size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates >250 micrometer in size. We also propose the stable aggregates index (SAI) and the stable macroaggregates index (SMaI) for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking. These indices account for the total weighted average of stable aggregates and the total weighted average of stable macroaggregates, respectively. Both the SAI and the SMaI indices were shown to be sensitive to the effects of vegetation on soil stability under different riparian buffer communities. The SAI and the SMaI indices were higher in surface soils under cool-season grass than any of the other treatments. These soils samples are well aggregated with SAI = 74% and SMaI = 56% followed by SAI = 55% and SMaI = 37% under existing riparian forest, SAI = 40% and SMaI = 21% under 7-yr switchgrass and SAI = 36% and SMaI = 18% under cropped system.

AB  - A paired-field study was made in southern England in arable fields, each with or without sown 6-m wide grass margin strips. Seven field pairs were located in each of small, intermediate and open landscapes, which were based on mean field size. Ground cover, plant species diversity and assemblages were assessed in crop centres, crop edges and non-crop field boundaries. The data were used to test for effects of sown grass margins, differences in field location, impacts on rare weed species and for landscape effects on weed assemblages. Significantly higher plant species diversity was found in boundaries protected by buffer strips. Annual weeds associated with field edges, notably Anisantha sterilis, were found at lower cover where perennial grass strips were present. Sown grass strips enhanced boundary plant diversity, particularly by increasing polycarpic species. Margin strips had a small influence on the weed flora of the crop edge, possibly reducing weed cover, but had no influence on floras of field centres. Field size and landscape context did not affect weed assemblages, which show marked field-to-field variability, though crop type was an important influence. Grass margins did not enhance rare arable weed species and may be a threat to them, if margins are sited where such species are known to occur in the seedbank. With this exception, grass strips are a positive influence on boundary flora diversity and reduce margin weeds in arable landscapes.

AB  - The hypothesis that sown 6 m grass margins strips at the edges of arable fields have a positive impact on farmland biodiversity was tested using a paired field approach in southern England. A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3-year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6 m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6 m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small fields with 6 m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields. More significantly, the success of agri-environment schemes, which will vary between taxa and species, can be dependent on landscape structure. Scheme administrators may need to address landscape structure and mean field size to achieve significant enhancement of populations of declining farmland species.

AB  - Les objectifs de la presente etude etaient de developper et de tester certaines mesures pratiques pour proteger les communautes vegetales des bords de champs et de valoriser les habitats de la faune sauvage en bordure des parcelles agricoles. Ainsi on a cree des bandes de vegetation perenne en bordure des parcelles agricoles pour augmenter la surface de flore herbacee le long de ces parcelles. Sur le terrain, un test de reproductibilite a ete effectue sur 18 sites situes dans certaines Zones ecologiquement sensibles (ESAs) en Grande-Bretagne, afin de determiner les meilleures methodes d'implantation de cette flore sur differents sols. Pour tester l'effet des bords de champ sur la biodiversite botanique, on a compare les flores des bords de champ de deux fermes attenantes: l'une ou les bandes de vegetation avaient ete enherbees et l'autre presentant des bandes naturellement en herbe. Les communautes vegetales sur ces deux sites etaient differentes. La flore des sables dans le Breckland etait differente de celle trouvee sur les sols crayeux de la region de South Wessex, ou sur les sols argileux dans le Somerset. Les semailles d'automne ont donne un meilleur couvert vegetal, mais la diversite floristique a ete plus grande pendant les deux premieres annees sur les parcelles semees au printemps. Les mesures de gestion prises la premiere annee (fauchage ou traitement selectif a l'aide d'herbicides) n'ont eu que des effets mineurs sur la diversite des especes. La diversite floristique a ete plus grande sur les parcelles semees d'un melange d'herbe et de fleurs sauvages, que sur celles ou il n'y avait que de l'herbe (presentant le plus petit nombre d'especes differentes) ou sur les parcelles laissees a une regeneration naturelle. Dans certains cas, la regeneration naturelle a donne des resultats acceptables. La diversite de la flore au bord des bandes enherbees a ete significativement plus grande que celle de la flore poussant plus loin qui, habituellement, est composee d'especes adaptees a des conditions de perturbation ecologique plus graves. Les resultats ont montre que dans plusieurs zones on a la possibilite d'entourer les champs de larges bordures. Grace a ces bandes, les habitats des especes gibier en milieu rural s'agrandiront. Elles fonctionneront comme des zones tampons puisqu'elles diminuent l'entrainement de fertilisants et de pesticides vers les habitats voisins. Le type de sol et l'emplacement du site ont eu une grande influence sur les resultats. Il est donc important de choisir le melange de semences et leur taux d'ensemencement en fonction du site

AB  - The purpose of this workshop was to develop the concept of the riparian zone work unit and ensure that the study addressed planning and operational needs within the Army Corps of Engineers. Topics included: ecological studies in riparian habitats, inventory and preservation of project- related riparian areas, development of environmentally beneficial designs for local flood protection projects, riparian habitats associated with multipurpose reservoirs, riparian problems in urban settings, and restoration of riparian vegetation and associated wildlife habitat through use of bioengineering techniques. Major concerns included: 1) Corps projects are strongly influenced by surrounding land uses, including agriculture, grazing, industry, urbanization, and recreation. Adverse impacts of these activities are often detrimental to the riparian zone and the stream itself, especially where a protective buffer strip is not established and maintained as part of the project plan. 2) Provision of bank protection and shoreline stabilization to prevent erosion and sedimentation and to reduce adverse impacts of project construction. Bank restoration and stabilization are best achieved through a bioengineering approach using native plant materials as much as possible.

AB  - Mesoamerican cloud forests are important centres of biodiversity, but are under severe pressure from anthropogenic activities. Protected areas have been established to conserve remaining areas of this habitat, but it is debatable how effective these under-resourced ‘paper parks' are in preserving biodiversity. This study investigates this issue utilising species-level data, examining composition of avifaunal communities within an undermanaged cloud forest park. Research was conducted in the Parque Nacional Cusuco, North-West Honduras. Results indicate that overall avian species richness is greater in the less heavily protected buffer zone than the nominally inviolate core zone. However, core zone areas are shown to be effective in preserving threatened and range-restricted species. Results therefore demonstrate that buffer zone forest has a comparably reduced conservation value, but the overall park system appears to be effective in conserving the core zone. These findings should be taken into account when considering extensions to protected area networks in Mesoamerica.

AB  - This study showed that the different compartments of the landscape within the Morcille watershed (vineyard soil, grass buffer strip soil, sediments), connected along the soil-water continuum, are able to mineralize the herbicide diuron. The purifying capability of these different compartments evolved according to the level of exposure to the contaminant. Indeed, the exposed grass buffer strip showed a better ability to mineralize diuron than the control one. The sediments of the Morcille river located nearby the buffer zone showed also a purifying capability following an upstream-downstream gradient in accordance with the one observed for the chemical quality of the water in Morcille river. The importance of the surface run-off from the vineyard to the sediments of the Morcille river for the adaptation of microbial communities to diuron-mineralization was showed. These original findings showed that although the microflora of the sediments was intrinsically able to adapt to diuron degradation, this process was favoured by soil run-off suggesting the transfer of purifying capabilities from soil to aquatic microbial communities, underlining the existence of chemical and microbiological connections of terrestrial and aquatic compartments of agro-systems. Monitoring of the evolution of the purifying capability of sediments in response to the ban of diuron uses evidenced the improvement of the chemical quality of the Morcille river. However, even four years after its ban, diuron was still detected in the river at the intermediary and downstream stations in spring and summer. Over this four-year period the purifying capability of the sediments significantly decreased. However an upstream-downstream gradient was still detectable, in accordance with the one observed for the chemical quality of the Morcielle water. The study of the diuron-degrading microbial community from the grass-buffer strip soil and from the sediments allowed isolating diuron-degrading microbial populations. Several Arthrobacter sp. isolates able to transform diuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline have been isolated from the soil and the sediments. Moreover, one additional bacterial isolate belonging to the Achromobacter genus and able to mineralize 3,4-dichloroaniline, has been isolated. A synthetic microbial consortium made of Arthrobacter sp. and Achromobacter sp. populations was shown to be able to fully mineralize diuron. These observations suggest that the microbial community able to mineralize the diuron in the soil of the buffer zone or in the sediments of the Morcille river was probably resulting from the metabolic cooperation of two bacterial populations, one transforming the diuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline while the other mineralized this intermediary metabolite. To conclude, this study shows that vineyard and grass buffer strip soils as well as the sediments of the Morcille River frequently exposed to diuron hosted a diuron-degrading microbial community able to degrade diuron. Degradation capabilities of these different compartments are variable and the level of exposure to the contaminant was shown as a major driver of the adaptation to diuron degradation. The purifying capability of vineyard and grass buffer strip soils sediments relied on the activity of microbial degrading populations developing cooperative metabolism.

AB  - Vineyard is among the crops the most heavily treated with pesticides. In the context of the new EU policy for the protection of water resources, vineyard area will account as one of the major contributor to water contamination. Grass buffer strips have recently been developed as a solution for reducing pesticide transfer by surface runoff from vineyard parcels to adjacent streams. Although pesticide interception by grass strips has generally been proven effective, little is known about the fate of intercepted pesticides. In order to tackle this question we worked since several years at the scale of a small watershed located in the Beaujolais vineyard (France). The ability of the soil microflora to degrade diuron, an herbicide belonging to phenyl-urea family, was addressed by radiorespirometric analyses showing that the grass buffer strip could develop efficient degrading ability if regularly exposed to the contaminant1. Interestingly, we revealed the presence of bacterial populations able to rapidly mineralize this herbicide in the grass buffer strips. We also showed that their genetic potential (puhA and puhB genes) could be transferred by erosion to the sediment of the river adjacent to the grass buffer strip2. With the aim to promote natural attenuation of pesticides in the grass buffer strip, bioaugmentation experiments with diuron-degrading bacterial populations are ongoing. All these data seem to indicate that the development of a second generation of engineered grass buffer strip acting as an ‘in field bioreactor’ favoring pesticide biodegradation could represent an interesting tool to protect water resources in the vineyard area.

AB  - The aim of the work is to evaluate the influence of data details on the tree species composition on the accuracy of  determining the degree of stands naturalness in the buffer zone Dobročský prales NNR. The degree of stands naturalness  was determined using GIS tools by comparing the real tree species composition of potential tree species composition,  based on the forest typology. We used two methods. First method was based on input data of tree species composition  from digital forest management plan. The second method was getting data on tree species composition by terrain mapping  in stands in buffer zone regardless of the spatial distribution of forest units. The result is comparasion of synthetic maps of degree of naturalness and the average values of naturalness for each spatial distribution of forest units above used methods. Influence of data details on the average value of naturalness for the whole area of the buffer zone do not consider significant. The comparasion of the average values of naturalness for individual spatial units, influence of data details seems significant. After the generalizations of the results we found confirmation of internal heterogeneity of tree species composition and natural conditions in spatial distribution of forest units. Main benefit of terrain mapping is a digital map provides a relatively precise identification and location of areas probably non-native tree species composition.

AB  - Temporarily open/closed estuaries in South Africa are being subjected to varying degrees of catchment land-cover transformation. Natural landscapes and hydrological functions are integral to the functioning of estuaries. The relationship between catchment land-cover and the health of the East Kleinemonde Estuary was investigated between 2011 and 2013, using geographic information system (GIS) techniques to delineate and quantify land-cover in the whole catchment, in the lower section of the catchment, and in the 1 km and 100 m buffer zones surrounding the estuary. Human activities, as outlined by the Department of Water Affairs resource directed measures (RDM) studies, and their associated land-cover classes are described. Possible links between catchment and buffer zone land-cover class composition and the health of the East Kleinemonde Estuary were explored. There was a relationship between catchment land-cover and estuarine health within all assessed catchment delineations. Natural land-cover was determined to be the best predictor of estuarine health for the East Kleinemonde system. The methods employed in this study can be applied to other temporarily open/closed estuaries in South Africa to prioritise these systems for rehabilitation and/or conservation.

AB  - Worldwide efforts have concentrated on developing monitoring methods that would enhance the assessment of progress toward achieving the 2010 conservation objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Threat reduction assessment is one such method. It provides an indirect measure of the effects of a conservation project by evaluating changes in human-induced direct threats to protected areas. We applied modified threat reduction assessments and the 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature standardized lexicon for classification of threats to Horsh Ehden and Al-Shouf Cedar nature reserves in Lebanon. Our goal was in part to test the suitability of this tool for improving monitoring and management effectiveness of protected forests in Lebanon. In Horsh Ehden, composite threats decreased by 24% from 1997 to 2002, and then increased from 2002 to 2009 by 78% in the core area of the reserve and by 118% in the reserve's buffer zone (surrounds core area, conservation and recreational activities allowed). In Al-Shouf Cedar reserve threats decreased by 51% from 2006 to 2009. Management teams from both reserves have integrated the use of this method to prioritize actions for new management plans. We believe that in Lebanon and other countries with limited resources and weak monitoring programs or that are experiencing political instability threat reduction assessments could be used to improve the effectiveness of protected areas management.

AB  - An appropriate evaluation of the effect is requested about the measure and public works introduced into the rural area. The development of the method for quantifying multiple functions for that is tried. The one method is to assume the population of beneficiaries of functions to be an index. When the population of beneficiaries is evaluated, it is necessary to clarify a geographic position with the beneficiary who receives the water supply facilities and the function. Then, the Sodegaura region in Chiba Prefecture was selected as a case, and the method to estimate the distribution of population in the large area was developed by the technique of the distribution to 100m grid cells in the housing lot where the basic unit district population of the Census had been estimated from the 1/10 subdivision land use of Digital National Land Information. There was a difference between the estimated population distributions by 10m grid cells in matters of detail. But, it was almost equal the population in total in the cognitive area in the waterside. In the large area evaluation, it was shown to be able to use both of estimations that used the population distribution in 100m grid cells that used the building site of 1/10 subdivision land use of Digital National Land Information and the 25m road buffer strip.

AB  - Riparian buffers, the vegetated region adjacent to streams and wetlands, are thought to be effective at intercepting and reducing nitrogen loads entering water bodies. Riparian buffer width is thought to be positively related to nitrogen removal effectiveness by influencing nitrogen retention or removal. We surveyed the scientific literature containing data on riparian buffers and nitrogen concentration in streams and groundwater to identify trends between nitrogen removal effectiveness and buffer width, hydrological flow path, and vegetative cover. Nitrogen removal effectiveness varied widely. Wide buffers (>50 m) more consistently removed significant portions of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers (0-25 m). Buffers of various vegetation types were equally effective at removing nitrogen but buffers composed of herbaceous and forest/herbaceous vegetation were more effective when wider. Subsurface removal of nitrogen was efficient, but did not appear to be related to buffer width, while surface removal of nitrogen was partly related to buffer width. The mass of nitrate nitrogen removed per unit length of buffer did not differ by buffer width, flow path, or buffer vegetation type. Our meta-analysis suggests that buffer width is an important consideration in managing nitrogen in watersheds. However, the inconsistent effects of buffer width and vegetation on nitrogen removal suggest that soil type, subsurface hydrology (e.g., soil saturation, groundwater flow paths), and subsurface biogeochemistry (organic carbon supply, nitrate inputs) also are important factors governing nitrogen removal in buffers.

AB  - Movement of agricultural nitrogen (N) into riparian buffers often occurs within discrete seepage or upwelling zones which can limit the ability of the ecosystem to process the nutrient delivered by exfiltrating groundwater. Characterization of the biogeochemical processing of N within these zones is important in assessing the effectiveness of riparian buffers for mitigating nutrient loading of surface waters. The biogeochemical potential for denitrification in zones of exfiltration within a riparian buffer wetland dominated by high-carbon mucky soils was found to be highly stratified by profile depth with substantially higher activity in the surface layer of soil. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) within these zones was partly related to the population size of denitrifying microorganisms as measured by the most probable number (MPN) as well as the general microbial population as measured by substrate-induced respiration. The addition of glucose to the DEA assay stimulated enzyme activity indicating that carbon substrate was limiting activity. The stratification patterns of microbial populations and DEA are consistent with new carbon inputs to the ecosystem being most important driver of biogeochemical reactions such as denitrification in this high-carbon environment. A survey of carbon inputs to the ecosystem under study identified two major sources that contribute most of the annual biomass carbon inputs to the wetland: skunk cabbage in early summer and tree leaf litter in the fall. Tests of the ability of annually deposited wetland plant residues to stimulate denitrification and microbial respiration indicated that the degree of stimulation was inversely related to the C/N ratio of these carbon sources.

AB  - Cost-effective nonpoint source phosphorus (P) control should target the land areas at greatest risk for P loss. We combined mass-balance modeling and geographic analysis to identify and map high-risk areas for P export by integrating long-term P input/output accounting with spatially variable physiographic, land use, and agronomic factors. The dynamic interactive simulation of phosphorus loss areas (DISPLA) model evaluates changes over time and space in soil P concentration and P export in response to management interventions targeted specifically to critical P source areas. Five scenarios were simulated in a test watershed dominated by dairy agriculture in Vermont's Champlain Valley: (1) baseline; (2) nutrient management applied to corn and hay land and to urban lawns; (3) erosion control applied to silage corn land; (4) conversion of critically eroding cropland to permanent grass; and (5) all management changes combined. If present-day conditions continue, soil test P and P export will inevitably increase as P inputs continue to exceed outputs. Soil test P levels on corn land are projected to increase more than fourfold over 80 years if present management continues; estimated P export is expected to more than double over the same period. Increases in soil test P over time in the watershed are not uniform, but varied spatially in response to variability in initial conditions and input/output P balance. Targeted nutrient management was effective in reducing soil test P concentrations (50-90%) and appeared to hold the line on P export for the test watershed over the 80-year simulation. Simulated P export in the test watershed at the end of the nutrient management simulation was reduced by 64% compared to baseline. Implementation of erosion control on row cropland had little effect on soil test P and achieved only a transitory reduction in P export. Exclusive reliance on cropland erosion control to manage nonpoint source P is unlikely to succeed over the long term. Conversion of critical row cropland to permanent grass reduced P export by 54%, but did not affect soil P levels. Because row cropland converted to grassland retains its soil test P concentration, management of converted grassland to reduce runoff and P export is very important; row cropland with elevated soil test P converted to riparian buffer may still serve as a source of dissolved P to runoff. Application of all management measures combined yielded a 74% reduction in P export. Implications to watershed P management are discussed.

AB  - When selecting a habitat, animals utilize habitat in which they yield the highest rate of energy. Differences in foraging costs and hunting success are therefore likely to affect habitat choice. In a previous study, we showed that African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) packs with territories inside Hwange National Park (HNP), over the course of several years, moved their territories into the buffer zone outside HNP, where reproductive success was higher but anthropogenic mortality exceeded natality. In this study, based on long‐term radio‐telemetry data from 22 African wild dog packs, we analysed whether differences in foraging costs and hunting success could have contributed to this territorial drift. Taking seasonality and pack size into account, we determined foraging costs (foraging distance and chase distance) and hunting success (successful or failed chase) inside and outside HNP. Although we observed no difference in foraging costs, hunting success was higher outside HNP, which is likely to have contributed to the territorial drift into the buffer zone outside the protected area. This study shows the importance of taking factors affecting hunting success into account in the conservation strategy of African wild dogs.

AB  - Lake plankton metacommunities are affected by their surrounding multidimensional landscape. Hence, understanding mechanisms shaping lake plankton communities requires considering not only local or geographical drivers, but also drivers at buffer zone level, indicating fluxes of nutrients and organic compounds. We investigated the effects of local, buffer zone (characterised via remote sensing) and geographical level variables on the phyto- and zooplankton community composition in 100 lakes distributed over five watersheds in Finland. We examined the community variation at two spatial scales using redundancy analysis with variation partitioning. Among watersheds, phyto- and zooplankton showed a small spatial imprint in their metacommunity structure, suggesting weak dispersal limitation. Environmental drivers explained negligible shares of the community variation, indicating weak species sorting. However, within single watersheds, larger fractions of the variation in communities were explained by the effects of multi-scale variables, suggesting that communities may be structured by species sorting and mass effects. Groups of variables exerted a relatively equal influence on the community composition. Including buffer zone variables into models increased the explained community variation by one-third. Due to the unique effects of the buffer zone on plankton composition, remotely sensed buffer zone variables may serve as useful proxies in analyses of lake plankton metacommunities.

AB  - During the last 40 years, nitrate (N03(-) has become one of the most common ground water contaminant. Stream riparian zones are considered important ecological ecotones that decrease the N03(-) load of ground water discharging into streams. This study uses N03-/Cl- ratios, natural abundances of 15N and 18O in NO3(-), and an in situ 15NO3(-) tracer experiment to evaluate N03(-) reducing processes occurring in ground water within a narrow grassed buffer strip bordering a stream in an agricultural watershed. The N03-/Cl-ratios (1.9-0.0 [M/M]) indicate that both NO3(-) consuming processes and mixing of two ground water flow regimes with different NO3(-) loads contribute to the drop observed in ground water NO3(-) concentrations within the riparian zone. delta 15N and delta 18O of the ground water NO3(-) within the riparian zone (delta 15N =5.1 to 48.8 per thousand; delta 18O=1.1  to 17.8 per thousand) were enriched compared to the ground water below the adjacent cultivated field (delta 15N = 3.8 to 10.1 per thousand; delta 18O=0.5 to 6.2 per thousand). A significant linear relationship (r2 = 0.97) between ground water delta 15N and delta 18O in NO3(-) was found, which is consistent with NO3(-) consumption by microbial denitrification. The estimated enrichment factors for 15N are a factor of 1.5 higher than for 18O. The in situ 15NO3(-) tracer experiment conclusively confirmed that denitrification is occurring within the ground water of the riparian zone and demonstrates that denitrification rates can be directly measured in situ.

AB  - Forestry plantations represent about 4� % of the global land cover and demand for wood is steadily increasing worldwide. Impacts of forest plantations on biodiversity are controversial; forest plantations could positively influence biodiversity by producing a buffer zone between native forests and agriculture, while replacement of native forests with plantations could reduce biodiversity. Chile is one of the main producers of wood worldwide, and production is largely based on intensively managed monocultures of exotic tree species. Only a few studies have looked at the effects of forestry plantations on biodiversity in Chile, mainly focusing on pine plantations. The aim of this study was to characterize habitat use and richness of bats between native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile to determine how land use affects an important mammalian taxa. We found no difference in use or richness of bats in eucalyptus plantations versus native forests. Regional context within the larger Valdivian watershed (Andes, central valley, coastal range) had a stronger influence on bat activity and richness than land use type (native forest, plantation, grassland), with the Andean region being the most diverse and where most bat activity is concentrated. Our results suggest that the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape mosaic may be fundamental to determine the impacts of forestry and human land use on biodiversity.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an isotopic study of spring waters in Świętokrzyski (Holy Cross Mountain) National Park (ŚNP), south-central Poland. The δ³⁴SV₋CDT and δ¹⁸OV₋SMOW of soluble sulfates (n=40) varied from 0.5‰ to 18.1‰ and from 3.5‰ to 12.2‰, respectively. The average δ³⁴S values are closely similar to those of rainwater, soils and rocks (comprising scattered pyrite). This suggests that soluble sulfates in the springs originated from mixing of recent and historic deposition, sulfates derived from pyrite oxidation, and CS-mineralization in soils and debris. An additional anthropogenic sulfur input (inorganic fertilizer) occurs in the water of spring S-61 located in the Świętokrzyski National Park buffer zone. The δ¹⁸OV₋SMOW of spring waters (n=4) were in the range of −10.6‰ to −10.2‰ indicating that they are derived from vadose groundwater in ŚNP. This was the first isotope study of spring waters in the national parks of Poland. It enabled the determination of sulfur pathways and discrimination between natural and anthropogenic sources of this element in a relatively pristine area.

AB  - The influence of buffer strips and soil texture on runoff of flufenacet and isoxaflutole was studied for two years in Northern Italy. The efficacy of buffer strips was evaluated on six plots characterized by different soil textures; two plots had Riva soil (18.6% sand, 63.1% silt, 18.3% clay) while the remaining four plots had Tetto Frati (TF) soil (37.1% sand, 57% silt, 5.9% clay). Additionally, the width of the buffer strips, constituted of spontaneous vegetation grown after crop sowing, was also compared for their ability to abate runoff waters. Chemical residues in water following runoff events were investigated, as well as their dissipation in the soil. After the first runoff events, concentrations of herbicides in water samples collected from Riva plots were as much as four times lower in waters from TF plots. On average of two growing seasons, the field half-life of flufenacet in the upper soil layer (5 cm) ranged between 8.1 and 12.8 days in Riva soil, 8.5 and 9.3 days in TF soil. Isoxaflutole field half-life was less than 1 day. The buffer strip was very affective by the uniformity of the vegetative cover, particularly, at the beginning of the season. In TF plots, concentration differences were generally due to the presence or absence of the buffer strip, regardless of its width.

AB  - Efforts to sustain human food production and simultaneously preserve the biodiversity of terrestial ecosystems and their vital functions for mankind led to the development of a "Closed Canopy and High Diversity Forest Farming System", popularly termed Rainforest Farming. The system is aiming to replace the more destructive forms of kaingin practices, form a buffer zone around the primary forests, protect its biodiversity, help maintain the water cycle of the island, and provide farmers with a stable and higher income. Contrary to conventional paradigm of farm management, the concept works with the hypothesis that a farming system is increasingly more sustainable as its physical structure and species composition becomes closer to the original local rainforest. In field trials on a 7 ha hilly area at ViSCA, 100 selected local tree species were tested for their performance in achieving a three-storied and maximally diverse rainforest association. Crop production is enriching the system through understory species of e.g. Colocasia (gabi) and Dioscorea (ubi) and a variety of unconventional activities, e.g. mushroom cultivation, apiculture, and flower production. Farmer-researchers are adopting the system by applying the basic principles and modifying the flexible components of their needs and to site specific requirements. A major drawback is the scarcity of seeds from highly valid tree species due to the almost complete extinction of the Philippine lowland rainforest and to ongoing selective timber poaching which is specifically eliminating "mother trees"

AB  - Forested riparian buffers are an increasingly common method of mitigating the negative effects of impervious surface cover on water quality and wildlife habitat. We sampled larval southern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) in 43 streams, representing the range of impervious surface cover and forested riparian buffer width across Wake County, NC, USA. Larval abundance decreased with increasing impervious surface cover in the upstream catchment, but was not affected by buffer width. This is likely a result of an incomplete buffer system and culverts or other breaches along streams. Larval abundance increased with detritus cover in the stream to a threshold and then decreased as detritus continued to increase. As percent pebble substrate in the stream increased, especially in perennial streams, larval salamander abundance also increased. We suspect salamanders were unable to migrate with the water column during dry periods in intermittent streams with sedimented interstices below the surface, resulting in low abundances. A combination of increased peak flows and sedimentation, reduced base flow, and chemical changes likely reduces the abundance of salamanders in urban and suburban streams. We suggest creation of catchment-wide, unbreached buffers to maintain the integrity of stream habitats in urbanizing watersheds.

AB  - Limited information exists on the effect of streambank fencing on riparian zone pastures. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that 4 to 6 yr of streambank fencing would improve the environmental quality of the cattle-excluded pasture compared with the grazed pasture and cause the fenced pasture to act as a buffer or filter strip. Rangeland health, vegetative and soil properties, and rainfall simulation runoff were measured in the cattle-excluded and adjacent grazed native pastures along the fenced reach of the Lower Little Bow River in southern Alberta, Canada, for 3 yr (2005–2007). Rangeland health was improved (health score increase from 55 to 72%); vegetation cover (13–21%) and standing litter (38–742%) were increased; and bare soil (72–93%) and soil bulk density (6–8%) were decreased under cattle exclusion, indicating an improvement in environmental quality from streambank fencing. In contrast, other vegetation (total and live basal area, fallen litter) and soil properties (soil water and soil C, N, and P) were not improved by cattle exclusion. Cattle exclusion significantly (P 0.10) reduced surface runoff depth of water (21–32%) and mass loads of total N fractions (21–52%) in 2 of 3 yr compared with the grazed pasture, suggesting that this fenced pasture may act as a buffer for certain runoff variables. In contrast, other runoff variables (turbidity, electrical conductivity, pH, concentrations and loads of total suspended solids, and certain N and P fractions) in the cattle-excluded pasture were generally not improved by streambank fencing. Overall, streambank fencing improved the quality of certain environmental variables within the cattle-excluded pasture.

AB  - Deteriorated water quality due to nonpoint source pollution from herbicides is one of the environmental problems receiving attention this decade. One off-site best management practice (BMP) being suggested to improve water quality is vegetative buffer strips. This study was conducted on a Storden loam soil, under simulated rainfall (6.35 cm/h), to determine the effects of nominal inflow concentration (0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) and the ratio of drainage area to vegetated buffer strip area (simulated to be 15:1 and 30:1) on the efficiency of vegetative buffer strips (12.2 m long) in removing herbicides dissolved in runoff water. Four treatments (2 X 2 factorial) replicated three times were included in the study. Three inflow samples (each integrated over 15 min) and nine outflow samples (each integrated over 5 min) were collected from each plot and analyzed for three herbicides. Reductions of 41, 39, and 38% from plots having a relative area ratio of 15:1, and 37, 35, and 34% from plots having a relative area ratio of 30:1 were measured, respectively, for atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine. Although the percentage of removal decreased for the larger area ratios for each herbicide, the decreases were not significant. Reductions of 29, 30, and 28% from plots having 0.1 mg/L nominal inflow concentration, and 49, 44, and 45% from plots having 1.0 mg/L nominal inflow concentration were measured, respectively, for atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine. The differences between reductions for the nominal inflow concentrations were significant. Using a bromide tracer, it was determined that the major factor in reduction of herbicide transport was infiltration of inflow into the vegetative buffer strips

AB  - To determine the size needed for buffer zones in an eradication program, dispersal ability of male Cylas formicarius (F.) was evaluated by the mark-release-capture method in the central part of Okinawa Island, Japan. Approximately 36,700 marked males were released from 2 islets. Forty-five pheromone traps were placed on 6 islets near Okinawa Island and 24 on the eastern seashore of Okinawa Island. Two traps were put at the 2 release points on the last day of the experiment. Of 71 recaptured males, 34 were caught by 3 traps on the Sea Road (a 5-km bank connecting Okinawa Island and an islet) located 2 km northwest of a release point. Sixty-two traps did not capture marked males. This result suggests that for C. formicarius eradication projects, a buffer zone with a minimum radius of 2-4 km should surround the area targeted for control

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine concentrations of some trace elements (lead, cadmium, chromium, and nickel) in soils along State Road 51 leading from Olsztyn to Olsztynek, northeastern Poland. The traffic flow had a significant effect on the content of heavy metals in soils lying along the road. Further away from the road, and under a lower traffic flow intensity, the amounts of contaminants originating from the motor traffic decreased. There was a pine forest growing by the road near Olsztyn, which served as a buffer zone for all the analyzed heavy metals. At all the sampling locations, the content of chromium was approximately the same as its natural concentration. The statistical analysis demonstrated that there was a strong negative correlation between the concentrations of nickel, lead, chromium, and cadmium in soils and the distance from the road. The biggest differences in the content of an individual element were determined for lead and the smallest ones—for cadmium. Emissions of trace elements depended on the differences in the traffic flow intensity, number, type, and speed of vehicles and on the atmospheric conditions as well as the distribution of buildings.

AB  - Lac a natural resin is secreted by a tiny scale insect, Kerria lacca Kerr. Its primary host plants such as kusum (Schleichera oleosa), palas (Butea monosperma) and ber (Zizyphus mauritiana) are available in peripheral and buffer zones of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR). An attempt has been made to study its life cycle and life span in different zones of SBR. Two strains, i.e., kusmi and rangeeni of lac insect are bivoltine in nature at SBR. The longest life span of 8 months 5 days was observed in baisakhi (summer) crop and shortest life span of 3 months 16 days is seen in katki (rainy) crop of rangeeni strain on palas tree in peripheral zone. The buffer zone also showed the same trend. The life span of young ranges from 44_111 days for all the crops, strains and host plants. The life span of adult male is 2_3 days and the life span of female insect varies between 62_148 days for different crops. The variation of life span of male, female as well as young occurs due to temperature, host plants and strains of lac insect.

AB  - Understanding all watershed systems and their interactions is a complex, but critical, undertaking when developing practices designed to reduce topsoil loss and chemical/nutrient transport from agricultural fields. The presence of riparian buffer vegetation in agricultural landscapes can modify the characteristics of overland flow, promoting sediment deposition and nutrient filtering. Watershed simulation tools, such as the USDA-Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution model, typically require detailed information for each riparian buffer zone throughout the watershed describing the location, width, vegetation type, topography, and possible presence of concentrated flow paths through the riparian buffer zone. Research was conducted to develop GIS-based technology designed to spatially characterize riparian buffers and to estimate buffer efficiency in reducing sediment loads in a semiautomated fashion at watershed scale. The methodology combines modeling technology at different scales, at individual concentrated flow paths passing through the riparian zone, and at watershed scales. At the concentrated flow path scale, vegetative filter strip models are applied to estimate the sediment-trapping efficiency for each individual flow path, which are aggregated based on the watershed subdivision and used in the determination of the overall impact of the riparian vegetation at the watershed scale. This GIS-based technology is combined with AnnAGNPS to demonstrate the effect of riparian vegetation on sediment loadings from sheet and rill and ephemeral gully sources. The effects of variability in basic input parameters used to characterize riparian buffers, onto generated outputs at field scale (sediment trapping efficiency) and at watershed scale (sediment loadings from different sources) were evaluated and quantified. The AnnAGNPS riparian buffer component represents an important step in understanding and accounting for the effect of riparian vegetation, existing and/or managed, in reducing sediment loads at the watershed scale.

AB  - This study was performed to suggest a soil loss reduction skill through estimating soil erosion from a small watershed including each type of sloping agriland by using GEOWEPP model. Experimental watershed at Gangwon province was selected for very typical sloping fields of highland agriculture in Alpine area. Runoff discharge and sediment load, hourly rainfall amount occurred during storm event were gauged, and weather data were obtained from Daegwallyeong meteorological station. The results of GEOWEPP model estimation showed that relative error values for total runoff discharge and sediment load were 3%, -14.5% respectively. Based on the result, soil erosion and waterway path map for each hillslope were made to select target hillslope. Several hillslopes of severe soil erosion were analyezed and then the optimal vegetative filter strip construction width and waterway path to plant grass were decided by using GEOWEPP Model.

AB  - Interest in transport of dissolved nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in forested ecosystems is growing because of potential effects of these solutes on streamwater quality and implications for C sequestration. Additional research will further the understanding about the dynamics of these soil solutes, particularly in response to harvesting of forests. Also, the purported role of riparian buffers, where logging is restricted along stream channels, in retaining soil solutes is not well studied in the steeply sloping terrain of the southern Appalachian Mountains. I examined solute transport in a first-order watershed in the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina that was harvested in February 2006 with retention of a 10-m riparian buffer.To quantify the movement of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), four transects of lysimeters, approximately 30 m apart, were installed perpendicular to the stream on one hillslope. Porous ceramic cup (2-bar) lysimeters were installed in each transect 1, 4, 10, 16, 30, and 50 m from the stream in the A horizon and B horizon, and 4, 16, and 50 m from the stream in the saprolite layer. Samples were removed from the lysimeters 24 hr after 50 centibars of tension were placed on them, and riparian groundwater well and stream samples were collected at the same time as lysimeter samples. Collection of samples from the lysimeters, wells, and stream occurred every four to six weeks for one calendar year beginning March 2007. A 16-wk laboratory N mineralization study was conducted on A horizon soils.Mean nitrate values in the soil solution of the A horizon in the spring were 1.53mg-N/L and decreased through the growing season to 0.030mg-N/L. Mean soil solution nitrate values in the B horizon and saprolite layer were 0.40mg-N/L in the spring and summer and decreased to 0.031mg-N/L in the winter. Mean soil solution ammonium concentrations were higher in the A horizon (0.090mg-N/L) than the B horizon and saprolite layer (0.034mg-N/L) and were lowest during the summer and fall. Dissolved organic C was significantly higher in the A horizon, with values ranging from 2.3mg/L to 599mg/L, than in the relatively stable B horizon and saprolite (1.9mg/L to 36.6mg/L). Dissolved organic C was logarithmically correlated to DON (r2 = 0.64), and DON values were highest in the A horizon (0.70mg/L). Cumulative N mineralization potential ranged from 48.1mg-N/kg to 75.6mg-N/kg and was not a useful predictor for nitrate soil solution values.Nitrate leached vertically, and a large percentage of nitrate was stored in the B horizon and saprolite. Ammonium, DON, and DOC did not appear to leach vertically because they did not increase in the B horizon or saprolite layer. Ammonium, DON, and DOC are less mobile in soil solution than nitrate. The 10-m riparian zone had little impact on nitrate, ammonium, DON, and DOC removal. Nitrate remaining in the A horizon was likely removed through plant uptake in the harvested area before reaching the riparian zone. There was no detectable difference between ammonium concentrations in the harvested area and riparian zone likely because of limited mobility. The riparian zone did not remove excess DON or DOC, and in some transects was a source of DON and DOC. Nitrate and DOC concentrations were highly variable among transects and locations within transects. This may be caused by sensitivity of these solutes to site heterogeneity. This suggests that a large number of lysimeters should be used to account for this variability in future studies to ensure accuracy.This study observed limited vertical leaching of ammonium, DON, and DOC through the profile. However, excess nitrate was observed moving from the A horizon into the B horizon and saprolite layer, suggesting the potential for delivery to the stream via subsurface transport and the need for attenuation of nitrate by the riparian zone. Because of low concentrations of nitrate entering the riparian zone during this study, the capacity for riparian attenuation of nitrate was not demonstrated.

AB  - Recent changes in Brazilian legislation reduced the width of riparian forest buffer needed to be preserved in private properties from 30 to 15 m or less. The consequences of these modifications can be dramatic, mainly because riparian buffer width is an important parameter for riparian forest structure and functioning. Our study assessed whether (1) macroinvertebrate family richness and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) family richness decrease with reduced riparian buffer width; (2) taxonomic composition and functional feeding group (FFG) composition of macroinvertebrates vary with a reduced riparian buffer width; and (3) reduced riparian buffer width similarly influence the macroinvertebrate community in different stream substrates. We selected three fragments with different riparian buffer widths (>40, <30, and <15 m) in three streams (fourth and fifth orders) in the Sinos River watershed, southern Brazil. Our results show that on all substrate types, reducing the width of the riparian buffer altered neither the macroinvertebrate richness nor EPT richness. However, EPT richness was greater in the substrates stone and gravel than leaf litter, independent of riparian buffer width. There was a significant difference in macroinvertebrate composition among riparian buffer widths. The macroinvertebrate composition and FFG differed among substrates, independent of riparian buffer width. This study showed that riparian buffer widths <15 m altered the macroinvertebrate community. A width greater than 15 m is necessary to maintain the composition and trophic conditions of macroinvertebrate families similar to those found in reference states of conservation.

AB  - Soil erosion occurs with sufficient frequency and severity on arable land in the UK to warrant erosion control measures. The main justification is to decrease the off-farm damages resulting from sedimentation and pollution. The grassing of valley floors, the creation of riparian buffer zones and the use of winter cover crops are recommended as suitable measures. These have additional benefits in terms of wildlife habitats and decrease of nitrate leaching. Financial incentives targeted at farmers in erosion-sensitive areas are proposed as the main method of implementation.

AB  - Eradication programs are being implemented for 2 sweetpotato weevil pests, Cylas formicarius and Euscepes postfasciatus, in the Ryiikyu Islands located in the southernmost part of Japan by the application of the sterile insect technique (SIT). As it is essential for the implementation of the programs to assess the dispersal ability of the weevils, recent studies were reviewed. Both the flight and walking ability of C. formicarius was much higher in males than in females when determined in the laboratory. Synthesized sex pheromone of C. formicarius has been used as a strong lure to capture the males in the field. Results of the mark-recapture experiments suggest that a distance of at least 2 km is needed for the range of the buffer zone to separate the SIT target area from others. Since E. postfasciatus is unable to fly, only the walking ability was evaluated in the laboratory, indicating that the females exhibited a fairly higher locomotion activity compared with the males. Since no effective attractant for E. postfasciatus has been identified yet, information on the dispersal activity in the field is limited. Fundamental studies should be conducted to determine the dispersal ability of both weevil pests to implement successfully the eradication programs.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the presence and evolution of aphid predator populations in common wheat in three agro-ecosystems of different management, two organic of diverse age and a conventional one, in relation to field margins. The study was carried out in the Montepaldi Long Term Experiment in Tuscany, in 2008. Insect predators belonging to the families of Coccinellidae, Syrphidae and Chrysopidae were assessed. The presence of eggs, larvae, pupae and adults in the ecological infrastructures of the field margins as well as inside wheat crop at three different distance from the field’s margin (0 m, 15 m, 30 m) was estimated. Results show that ladybirds are more affected by agroecosystem management and field margin type than the other insect predators. In fact they are present in greater numbers in organic farming systems than in conventional one and in the more complex and rich ecological infrastructure. The number of insect predators within the wheat crop was not affected by the distance from the field’s margin.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the attitude of local people towards the contribution of agroforestry practices to socio-economic development in the buffer zone area of Mt Elgon National Park, Uganda. Primary data were collected through formal household survey conducted during June-October 2004 with the use of questionnaires administered to 120 households selected randomly from Mutushet and Kortek Parishes. Data were analysed using chi-squared test and logistic regression model. The results support the hypothesis that the attitude of people towards agroforestry practices is independent of existence of collaborative forest management, ethnic group, sedentary farming experience and family size but depends on main occupation, education status, distance from park boundary, damage caused by wild animals, landholding size and total livestock units owned. Factors that significantly influenced adoption of agroforestry technologies were age of the household head, education status, extension contact, family labour force and gender. There is need to intensify extension programmes in those areas where the majority of people have negative attitude towards agroforestry practices.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are an environmental management tool used to reduce sediment and pesticide transport from surface runoff. Numerical models of VFS such as the Vegetative Filter Strip Modeling System (VFSMOD-W) are capable of predicting runoff, sediment, and pesticide reduction and can be useful tools to understand the effectiveness of VFS and environmental conditions under which they may be ineffective. However, as part of the modeling process, it is critical to identify input factor importance and quantify uncertainty in predicted runoff, sediment, and pesticide reductions. This research used state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis tools, a screening method (Morris) and a variance-based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test), to evaluate VFSMOD-W under a range of field scenarios. The three VFS studies analyzed were conducted on silty clay loam and silt loam soils under uniform, sheet flow conditions and included atrazine, chlorpyrifos, cyanazine, metolachlor, pendimethalin, and terbuthylazine data. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was the most important input factor for predicting infiltration and runoff, explaining >75% of the total output variance for studies with smaller hydraulic loading rates (approximately 100–150 mm equivalent depths) and approximately 50% for the higher loading rate (approximately 280-mm equivalent depth). Important input factors for predicting sedimentation included hydraulic conductivity, average particle size, and the filter's Manning's roughness coefficient. Input factor importance for pesticide trapping was controlled by infiltration and, therefore, hydraulic conductivity. Global uncertainty analyses suggested a wide range of reductions for runoff (95% confidence intervals of 7–93%), sediment (84–100%), and pesticide (43–100%) . Pesticide trapping probability distributions fell between runoff and sediment reduction distributions as a function of the pesticides' sorption. Seemingly equivalent VFS exhibited unique and complex trapping responses dependent on the hydraulic and sediment loading rates, and therefore, process-based modeling of VFS is required.

AB  - Agricultural and other disturbed lands contribute to non-point source pollution of water bodies (streams and lakes). Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are often recommended to reduce off-site impacts. Design guidelines to optimize performance of VFS are not readily available. A process-based model is presented to simulate the hydrology of a Vegetative Filter Strip for a given event. The model consists of a quadratic finite element overland flow submodel, based on the kinematic wave approximation, coupled with an infiltration submodel based on a modification of the Green-Ampt equation for unsteady rainfall. The model is used to study the effect of soil type, stope, surface roughness, buffer length, storm pattern and field inflow on the VFS performance. Filter performance, i.e., reduction of the runoff volume, velocity and peak, is higher for denser grass cover, smaller slopes and soils with higher infiltration capacity. Time to peak(s) depended mainly on the roughness-slope combination

AB  - This study presents the statistical evaluation of the vegetative filter strip modeling system VFSMOD-W as a tool to design vegetative filter strips to use in the mitigation plans required as a part of phosphate mining permitting process by the State of Florida. A two-step statistical evaluation framework using global techniques is presented based on: (1) a screening method (Morris) for qualitative ranking of parameters, and (2) a variance-based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test--extended FAST) for quantitative sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Measured characteristics of the central Florida phosphate-mining region are used to construct the 16 probability distributions of input factors. Two design filter lengths (3 and 6 m) and two model structures (VFSM--the filter module alone, and UH/VFSM--combined filter and source area components) are considered and compared to previous local "one-parameter-at-a-time" (OAT) analyses. It was found that for this application the filter's saturated hydraulic conductivity (VKS) was the most important factor controlling the filter runoff response, explaining over 90% of total output variance irrespective of model structure. In the case of the VFSM structure, sediment-related outputs were mainly influenced by three parameters: sediment particle size diameter (DP), effective flow width of the strip (FWIDTH), and VKS. For UH/VFSM, there were six important parameters: DP, the source area erosion and runoff parameters (slope of the source area Y, USLE soil erodibility index K, and runoff curve number CN), FWIDTH, and VKS. The results show the model's additive nature for this specific application, i.e., there are no significant parameter interactions for all model outputs except sediment outflow concentration and sediment wedge geometry. The uncertainty analysis indicates that regardless of the model structure, the probability of meeting a minimum required 75% sediment reduction was acceptable at the 90% confidence level for the 6 m long filter, but not for the 3 m filter. In general the UH/VFSM model structure exhibited larger output uncertainty. Comparison with previous OAT analyses of the model indicates the importance of performing the global evaluation for each specific model application. The results illustrate four main products of the global analysis: ranking of importance of the VFSMOD-W parameters for different outputs, effect of changing modeling structure, type of influence of the important parameters, and assurance of the model's behavior.

AB  - Land-use and cover changes around Budongo Forest Reserve (BFR) were analysed from multi-temporal LandSat images (1988 and 2002) and associated field-based studies in 2003-2004. Three major land-use and cover classes: forest/woodland, sugarcane plantations and grassland/shifting-cultivation/settlements were clearly discriminated. The area under sugarcane cultivation increased over 17-fold, from 690 ha in 1988 to 12729 ha in 2002, with a concomitant loss of about 4680 ha (8·2 per cent) of forest/woodland, mainly on the southern boundary of BFR. Land-use and cover changes were a result of (a) agricultural expansion, (b) increasing human population, exacerbated by large influxes of refugees, (c) conflicts of interest and political interference in the management of BFR and (d) unclear land tenure. Agriculture is the main land-use practice and source of income to local people, with commercial sugarcane and tobacco as the primary cash crops. Individual smallholder sugarcane plantations covered distances ranging from 30 to 1440 m along the BFR edge, with no buffer zone, resulting in direct conflicts between farmers and forest wild animals. There is an ever-increasing need for more land for agricultural expansion, resulting in continued loss of forest/woodland on private/communal lands and encroachment into BFR. This unsustainable agricultural expansion and the local people's perception of BFR as an obstacle to agriculture, threatens the conservation of its threatened wild plants (e.g. Raphia farinifera) and the endangered chimpanzees. Therefore, their sustainable management for both development and conservation will require strong and incorruptible institutions that will seek a balance between resource exploitation and conservation.

AB  - Nitate retention in riparian buffer strips is well documented in summer periods, but the potential of winter retention within these zones is poorly documented. Two sites, grass (Lolium perenne L.), and poplar (Populus italica)-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO3- concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO3 was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO3 absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO3-) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO3-) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO3- in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO3- reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.

AB  - This article compares a range of initiatives aimed at involving people in the management of forest resources in Nepal and India. In Nepal, we focus on three categories of state-initiated programs: community forestry, the parks' buffer zone program, and leasehold forestry. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, we study the state-initiated Joint Forest Planning and Management program along with older institutions of leaf manure forests (Soppina betta) and historical sacred forests (Kans). We conclude that state-initiated approaches to involving communities have been limited, at best, promote standardized and relatively inflexible management practices, and lead to partial improvement in biodiversity and people's livelihoods. When management is initiated and owned by the community, as in the case of sacred groves in India, and when other conditions are appropriate, communities can have the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for putting effective and adaptive conservation practices in place.

AB  - Reduced soil porosity, water content, forest floor mass and rutting are four common disturbances during timber harvesting and skidding. The present study was conducted to evaluate effects of skid trail slope and traffic frequency on soil disturbance in a temperate mountainous forest. Four levels of traffic (3, 7, 14 and 20 passes of a rubber skidder HSM 904), and three levels of slopes (gentle <10%, moderate 10-20%, steep >20%) were applied in three replicates consequently, 36 plots with 10m long by 4m wide were utilized in the study. All samples were taken from four randomized 4m-transects in each plot across the wheel track perpendicular to the direction of travel with 2m buffer zone between lines to avoid interactions. Results showed that during skidding total porosity, soil water and Forest floor decreased significantly (P <=0.05). Average total porosity on the treatments of >20% slope reduced significantly (P <=0.05) in comparison with those of <20% slope through all level of traffics. The lowest total porosity was identified in treatment with slope >20% and 14 passes by soil compaction. Soil water content was decreased up to 45% after skidding in comparison with undisturbed area. There was a negative correlation between water content and skid trail slope. The forest floor mass decreased on steep trail during skidding in all traffics. The amount of forest floor mass on the treatments under the 7 passes and slopes of >20% treatments (437.6kgha⁻¹) was significantly (P <=0.05) lower than those under the 14 passes and slopes of <10% (841.4kgha⁻¹). Rut depth were recorded in 14 passes and increased with slope (18cm<10%, 27.5cm in 10-20% and 34.5cm in >20%). In 3 passes, increase of skid trail slope from 10% to 20% corresponded to a decrease of 15%, 22%, and 67% in total porosity, water content and forest floor mass, respectively. The results indicated that slope steepness had a strong effect on the soil physical properties. In the present study, the skidder extracted different volume of logs during skidding operation. In order to obtain better interpretation the skidder must carry a fixed load during operation.

AB  - The effects of artificial disturbance on the structure and floristics of cool temperate rainforest patches in eastern Tasmania were investigated over a 2-year period. The effectiveness of buffer zones of varying widths in protecting the rainforests from nearby logging disturbance was also assessed. The width and nature of the eucalypt forest-rainforest boundary was also examined. Where the boundary of the rainforest is coincident with a sharp topographic feature the boundary is also sharp and is often less than 40 m wide. Where the boundary is not coincident with a sharp topographic feature the boundary may be diffuse and greater than 40 m wide, or, if there has been a recent fire, the boundary may be very sharp. In all cases, a buffer zone at least 40 m wide is considered sufficient to protect the rainforest from adjacent disturbance.

AB  - Riparian buffer system (RBS) effectiveness in reducing nonpoint source pollution from surface runoff can be evaluated by measuring constituent concentrations and flow volumes entering and exiting the system. This article describes the development and precision assessment of a low-cost, low-maintenance surface runoff sampling system (ROSS) in measuring flow volumes and collecting flow-weighted samples. The primary components of ROSS are a solar panel, battery, pump with a float switch, and splitter assembly at a cost of $218 (2001). ROSS delivers the runoff collected in a sump to a V-shaped splitter that separates successive fractions of the total flow using six dividers. Eighteen ROSS units were subjected to lab and field tests to establish calibration and quality control parameters and to determine the allowable maintenance interval. The results indicate ROSS units provide a reasonable precision over time, as indicated by flow volumes being within a 95% confidence interval of expected values for 96% (divider #1), 100% (#2), 96% (#3), 89% (#4), 69% (#5), and 56% (#6) of the units. The mean measured flow volumes by each divider in the lab and in the field were significantly different (alpha = 0.05), suggesting calibration factors are best determined in the field. ROSS units provided runoff samples with the same precision over a 3-month period, demonstrating an ability to maintain calibration over time. The ROSS unit meets the needs of a low-cost, flow-weighted sampler with reasonable accuracy and ease of use and should facilitate more widespread field assessments of RBS constituent-removal effectiveness.

AB  - Vietnam has a coastal line of 3600 km with a large wetland (tidal area) area of 600,000 ha (according to the survey statistics of the Institute of Planning and Economics under the Ministry of Fisheries), in which mangrove areas occupy a big part. Before the war, there were about 400,000 ha of mangroves in Vietnam; the largest area located in the South of Vietnam (Mekong River Delta) mainly in Tra Vinh, Soc Trang and Minh Hai. Mangrove forest serves as buffer zone or as biological filter layer. Mangrove is not only a very important ecosystem for forestry and agriculture but plays a decisive role in exploitation, aquaculture and biodiversity yield. Mangrove forests of Vietnam, especially in the South of Vietnam has been the main source of livelihood for farmers and fishermen, for a long time, which until now still occupy a large proportion of the whole country.

Nesse contexto, este trabalho buscou analisar a dinâmica temporal do uso e cobertura da terra, a predisposição a riscos ambientais e o potencial natural das zonas de amortecimento de duas unidades de conservação no Estado de São Paulo. Esta análise foi construída a partir de imagens orbitais do sensor TM/Landsat-5 e métricas de paisagem manipuladas em ambiente SIG (Sistema de Informação Geográfica). As zonas de amortecimento revelaram um processo de reestruturação da matriz agrícola, onde a intensificação do uso das terras e a concentração de áreas urbanizadas representa os fatores que ameaçam diretamente a integridade biológica das áreas protegidas. Os remanescentes de vegetação encontram-se extremamente fragmentados, isolados e em processo contínuo de supressão, onde medidas conservacionistas de proteção e recuperação precisão ser adotadas.AbstractThe analysis of development activities in buffer zones of protected natural areas contributes with the identification of elements that question the functionality, the contradictions and the limits of sustainable development in these regions.

This analysis was constructed from satellite images of TM/Landsat-5 sensor and landscape metrics manipulated in GIS (Geographic Information Systems). The buffer zones revealed a process of restructuration of the agricultural matrix in which the intensification of land use and the concentration of urban areas represents the factors that directly threaten the biological integrity of protected areas. The vegetation remnants are extremely fragmented, isolated and in continuing process of clearance, where conservation measures to protect and recover them need to be adopted.

AB  - It is popularly accepted that vegetated buffer zones are effective in removing water pollutants from surface runoff. However, there is a paucity of detailed information about establishing and maintaining buffer zones under different conditions, particularly in large catchments with diverse land uses. This paper reviews information on the application and effectiveness of vegetated buffer zones, and seeks to provide guidelines on their use for water quality control. Investigations into the use of buffer zones are grouped here into three major categories: studies of runoff plots or confined field areas; studies of operational forestry catchments; and studies of agricultural catchments. The degree of effectiveness of buffer zones for water pollution control in all these categories is generally attributed either to physical properties of the buffer zones (such as width, slope, vegetative cover, or soil type) or to the type of pollutant encountered. However, it is clear that although buffer zones have been shown to work well under small scale, experimental conditions, they lack success for water quality control on a broad catchment basis. In this respect, it is important that runoff must enter a buffer zone as shallow, overland flow in order to be slowed or detained, and that excessively channelised runoff will pass through a buffer zone unhindered. Buffer zones positioned close to sources of surface water pollution are therefore more likely to succeed in controlling water quality. It is suggested that although buffer zones are capable of removing pollutants from surface runoff, the proximity of buffer zones to sources of pollution is more important to their effectiveness than has been generally recognised. In view of this, the successful use of buffer zones for water quality control would require that they be comprehensively arranged along streams and around pollution sources in a catchment, and therefore that a large proportion of catchment area be set aside for this purpose. The real value of buffer zones in any situation would rest not only on their ability to control water quality, but on a number of other benefits and costs associated with maintaining large areas of natural vegetation.

AB  - Field margins within intensively managed ecosystems are often seen as a last refuge for biodiversity, and are typically targeted with measures within many agri‐environment schemes. Grassland accounts for 81� million ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied. This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5‐year period. Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower mixture, at three margin widths. Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact on parasitoid communities. Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus richness and community structure. This suggests that structural diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community structure. Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of idiobionts in particular. Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as fencing of narrow field margins may be as effective at increasing parasitoid taxon richness and abundance (indicators of arthropod richness and abundance) as expensive measures such as reseeding and wider margin widths.

AB  - Spiders contribute considerably to diversity in agroecosystems and are important components of natural pest control. Farming system and adjacent habitats may influence spider diversity. In this study, diversity of the spider families Lycosidae and Linyphiidae was studied after spring sowing until the time when a common pest (Rhopalosiphum padi) colonizes cereal fields. The spiders were collected with pitfall traps at eight organically or conventionally managed farms around Uppsala, Sweden, in three different habitats at each site: field margin, crop field and the edge between the two. The effects of farming system and habitat type on diversity of lycosids and linyphiids were considered using three different measures (activity density, species richness and composition). The most dominant species of each spider family, Pardosa agrestis (Lycosidae) and Oedothorax apicatus (Linyphiidae), had higher activity density at organic sites, and farming systems also contained different species compositions of both lycosid and linyphiid spiders. Also, linyphiid species richness was higher on conventional sites and linyphiid species composition was influenced by habitat type, in contrast with lycosids. Activity density and species richness of lycosid spiders were, on the other hand, more associated with field margins than linyphiid spiders.

AB  - Lycosid and linyphiid spiders were collected over a full cropping season around Uppsala, Sweden, in eight organic spring sown cereal fields in three different habitat types: field margin, field, and the edge between the two. The sites were located in landscapes with different proportions of non-crops, forest, perennial crops, annual crops, and number and sizes of arable fields. The field margin, compared with the field habitat, was found to be important for the activity density of lycosids, and for the species richness and composition of linyphiids. Landscape parameters were central for the activity density of linyphiids and for the species richness and composition of Lycosidae. A diverse landscape with easy access to perennial crops and forest in addition to field margins will augment both the number of species and individuals of the two spider families.

AB  - The concentrations of pollutants associated with cement production and the effects on ambient air and community health were assessed in this study. Suspended particulates were monitored using a Negretti 1000ᵀᴹ air sampler. Additionally, an Ogawaᵀᴹ sampler was employed to assess levels of selected gaseous pollutants at selected sites. To collect data on health status, a questionnaire survey was used for selected neighbouring communities and clinic records for industry workers. The data were analysed with the aid of percentage, variation test, correlation and regression statistics. Mean concentrations of particulate matter of 10 μ (74–338 μg/m³) and 2.5 μ (28–116 μg/m³) were significantly higher than permissible limits (50 μg/m³ and 10 μg/m³) within and around the production plant. At all sites, levels of sulphur dioxide (0.1–12 ppb), nitrogen dioxide (0.1–13 ppb) and carbon monoxide (0.1–1.7 ppm) were below the allowable limits for human exposure. Analysis of variance showed significant spatial variations (p < 0.01) in the concentrations of the monitored pollutants; higher concentrations were monitored at sites in proximity to factory location. The health profile of the factory workers and some residents of neighbouring communities showed high levels of respiratory and skin infections. Enforcement of law with regard to compliance on emissions and creation of a buffer zone around the cement factory would safeguard the environment and human health.

AB  - The implementation of a geodata-based probabilistic pesticide exposure assessment for surface waters in Germany offers the opportunity to base the exposure estimation on more differentiated assumptions including detailed landscape characteristics. Since these characteristics can only be estimated using field surveys, water body width and depth, hydrology, riparian buffer strip width, ground vegetation cover, existence of concentrated flow paths, and riparian vegetation were characterised at 104 water body segments in the vineyard region Palatinate (south-west Germany). Water body segments classified as permanent (n=43) had median values of water body width and depth of 0.9m and 0.06m, respectively, and the determined median width:depth ratio was 15. Thus, the deterministic water body model (width=1m; depth=0.3m) assumed in regulatory exposure assessment seems unsuitable for small water bodies in the study area. Only 25% of investigated buffer strips had a dense vegetation cover (>70%) and allow a laminar sheet flow as required to include them as an effective pesticide runoff reduction landscape characteristic. At 77 buffer strips, bordering field paths and erosion rills leading into the water body were present, concentrating pesticide runoff and consequently decreasing buffer strip efficiency. The vegetation type shrubbery (height>1.5m) was present at 57 (29%) investigated riparian buffer strips. According to their median optical vegetation density of 75%, shrubberies may provide a spray drift reduction of 72±29%. Implementing detailed knowledge in an overall assessment revealed that exposure via drift might be 2.4 and via runoff up to 1.6 fold higher than assumed by the deterministic approach. Furthermore, considering vegetated buffer strips only by their width leads to an underestimation of exposure by a factor of as much as four. Our data highlight that the deterministic model assumptions neither represent worst-case nor median values and therefore cannot simply be adopted in a probabilistic approach.

AB  - To prevent soil runoff from logging roads and skid trails, buffer zones are commonly established along both sides of streams. These buffers range in width from 10 to 100 m from the center of the stream, depending on stream width, (from 1 to  40 m) as dictated by the Reduced-Impact Logging Guidelines for Lowland and Hill Dipterocarp Forests in Indonesia. In the Bukit Tarek Experimental Watershed in Malaysia, sediment accumulations were observed along narrow streams after logging despite the presence of 20-m-wide buffer zones, double the width set out in the guidelines. Thus, we examined erosion-accumulation depths on different slopes in 20-m-wide buffer zones to clarify the spatial effects on sediment discharge, particularly as it relates to the microtopography and the vegetation cover, including fallen trees. Some of the accumulation depths at lower elevations and along streams were small, whereas on steep concave slopes and hollows that extend to streams, large accumulations were observed 1 year after logging. These findings indicated that, although a 20-m-wide buffer zone may be partly effective at preventing sediment discharge, it is not adequate on concave slopes (lower side-hollows and channel walls) where surface flows often converge. We compared several physical properties of the surface soil in accumulated areas relative to undisturbed areas and demonstrated that bulk density was larger and total porosity and coarse porosity were smaller in the accumulated soils, especially on lower side-hollows. These results indicate that soils accumulated on concave slopes would accelerate the occurrence of surface flow. Tree distribution was not dense in the buffer zones, but fallen trees and the relatively dense understory vegetation including rattans and palms partly prevented the discharge of sediment into streams. Our findings suggested that 20-mwide buffer zones with dense fallen trees and understory vegetation are partly sufficient to prevent sediment discharge; however, along steep concave slopes and hollows where rain water converges, wider and thicker buffer zones are needed.

AB  - We conducted a preliminary examination of the responses of stream amphibians and instream habitat conditions to alternative riparian buffer zones with forest thinning upslope. Pre and posttreatment surveys were carried out on 68 headwater stream reaches (including 23 unthinned reference reaches) at 11 sites in western Oregon. Streams were in managed conifer stands, 40 to 80 years old, where the thinning treatment reduced stands from 600 trees per hectare (tph) to 200 tph. Treatments consisted of four widths of riparian buffers approximately 6, 15, 70, and 145 m on each side of streams. Over three study years, 3,131 individuals of 13 species were detected. For the more common instream and bank species analyzed, capture rates persisted posttreatment with no negative treatment effect from thinning with any of the buffer widths. More animals were detected after thinning in treatment reaches compared to reference reaches for rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa Skilton) occurring on stream banks, and for instream coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus Baird and Girard). Treatment effects on instream habitat parameters were not detected. Interannual variation was evident for western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum Cooper), and several habitat conditions including pool-riffle ratio, stream spatial intermittency, stream width, and down wood. Overall, riparian buffers with moderate upslope thinning (200 tph) seemed to have retained the aquatic vertebrate community along channels among sites in the first 2 years posttreatment; however, several limitations of the study reduce the inference of the findings, and these preliminary results are best interpreted as hypotheses for further investigation.

AB  - 1. Bumblebees provide an important pollination service to both crops and wild plants. Many species have declined in the UK, particularly in arable regions. While bumblebee forage requirements have been widely studied, there has been less consideration of whether availability of nesting sites is limiting. It is important to know which habitats contain the most bumblebee nests per unit area in order to guide conservation and management options; particularly in the light of current emphasis on environmental stewardship schemes for farmed landscapes. However, it is extremely difficult to map the distribution of bumblebee nests. 2. We describe the findings of the National Bumblebee Nest Survey, a structured survey carried out by 719 volunteers in the UK during early summer 2004. The surveyors used a defined protocol to record the presence or absence of bumblebee nests in prescribed areas of gardens, short grassland, long grassland and woodland, and along woodland edge, hedgerows and fence lines. The records allowed us to estimate the density of bumblebee nests in each of these habitats for the first time. 3. Nest densities were high in gardens (36 nests ha⁻¹), and linear countryside habitats (fence lines, hedgerows, woodland edge: 20-37 nests ha⁻¹), and lower in non-linear countryside habitats (woodland and grassland: 11-15 nests ha⁻¹). 4. Findings on nest location characteristics corroborate those of an earlier survey carried out in the UK ( Fussell & Corbet 1992 ). 5. Synthesis and applications. Gardens provide an important nesting habitat for bumblebees in the UK. In the countryside, the area occupied by linear features is small compared with that of non-linear features. However, as linear features contain high densities of nests, management options affecting such features may have a disproportionately large effect on bumblebee nesting opportunities. Current farm stewardship schemes in the UK are therefore likely to facilitate bumblebee nesting, because they provide clear guidance and support for 'sympathetic' hedgerow and field margin management.

AB  - This study established for the first time the impact of harvesting on post-harvest papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) biomass regeneration potential, with two harvesting regimes compared. Above-ground papyrus biomass was determined. Biomass varied with site. Site had no effect on regeneration potential, but monthly harvesting reduced papyrus biomass regeneration potential among sites. However, seasonal (6-monthly) harvesting did not appear to affect papyrus biomass regeneration potential. Exponential and polynomial trend analyses revealed a consistent downward trend for monthly harvest biomass, and the polynomial trend was more linear (F = 97.913; P < 0.001) than periodic (F = 9.617; P < 0.05). The polynomial trend scenario indicated how papyrus biological dynamics are likely to behave as monthly harvests are repeated. This suggests that regeneration potential is significantly reduced with successive monthly harvest, leading to weak spatial connectivity, papyrus stand fragmentation, and increased landscape patchiness. A 6-month harvest regime can be established to regenerate more biomass between harvests than is currently the case, with positive implications for wetland conservation and carbon sequestration. Papyrus harvesters can be kept off the swamps by establishing a riparian buffer zone of agro forestry trees and shrubs which can substitute for the papyrus as it is left to mature. However, while the information presented is useful for papyrus wetland management strategies, it is recognized that the study period was too short to permit a generalized recommendation.

AB  - The aquatic vegetation of Číčov Lake in the Danube floodplain, which is listed in the Ramsar Convention, was investigated to address three main questions: (1) how have landscape composition and the structures of the lake and its buffer zone changed from the mid-20th century; (2) how have species richness and the abundance of the aquatic macrophyte assemblage in this lake ecosystem changed over the last 34 years; and (3) which landscape metrics can best explain these temporal changes for floating-leaved macrophytes? Two methodological approaches, remote sensing and botanical field surveys, were applied. Historical (1949, 1970, 1990) and contemporary (2006) aerial photographs were analysed to determine land cover. Landscape configuration and structure were analysed using eight landscape metrics selected in advance to measure spatio-temporal changes and the fragmentation of the lake ecosystem and its corresponding buffer zone. The species diversity, abundance and distribution of true aquatic macrophytes were surveyed eleven times in five survey stretches between 1973 and 2007. At the landscape level, a decrease in the area covered by floating-leaved macrophytes, as well as an increase in open water surface and fragmentation of the land cover classes in the lake ecosystem, were recorded from 1949 to 2006. Overall, 30 true aquatic macrophytes were found from 1973 to 2007. Species richness did not change considerably, but the abundance of aquatic species fluctuated over the years. Three groups of true aquatic vegetation, based on common structural characteristics, were found in 1973–1983, 1989–2002, and 2004–2007 over the last 34years. The landscape metrics NP, PD, LPI, and SHDI, which all express patterns of landscape fragmentation mostly indicate temporal changes in floating-leaved macrophytes.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) can reduce runoff losses of pollutants such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from land areas treated with fertilizers. While VFS effectiveness is considered to depend on lengths of pollutant source and VFS areas, there is little experimental evidence of this dependence, particularly when the pollutant source is manure-treated pasture. This study assessed the effects of pollutant source area (fescue pasture treated with poultry litter) length and VFS (fescue pasture) length on VFS removal of nitrate N (NO3-N), ammonia N (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl N (TKN), ortho-P (PO4-P), total P (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), total suspended solids (TSS), and fecal coliform (FC) from incoming runoff. This research examined poultry litter-treated lengths of 6.1, 12.2, and 18.3 m, with corresponding VFS lengths of up to 18.3 m, 12.2 m, and 6.1 m, respectively. Runoff was produced from simulated rainfall applied to both the litter-treated and VFS areas at 50 mm/h for 1 h of runoff. Pollutant concentrations in runoff were unaffected by litter-treated length but demonstrated a first-order exponential decline with increasing VFS length except for TSS and FC. Runoff mass transport of NH3-N, TKN, PO4-P, TP and TOC increased with increasing litter-treated length (due to increased runoff) and decreased (approximately first-order exponential decline) with increasing VFS length when affected by VFS length. Effectiveness of the VFS in terms of NH3-N, TKN, PO4-P, TP and TOC removal from runoff ranged from 12-75, 22-67, 22-82, 21-66, and 8-30% respectively. The data from this study can help in developing and testing models that simulate VFS performance and thus aid in the design of VFS installed downslope of pasture areas treated with animal manure.

AB  - Historical to recent spatial variability in surface waterlogging was evaluated using a topographical map of 1925 and satellite images of 1975, 1988, 1999 and 2006. A visual satellite image interpretation technique was used to delineate waterlogged areas and associated infrastructure details. Areas of 31, 73.89, 163.86, 143.61 and 102.59 km² were found to be affected by surface waterlogging during 1925, 1975, 1988, 1999 and 2006, respectively. A sharp increase in waterlogging from 1925 to 1975 is attributed to the functioning of irrigation projects in the region. The very high areas under waterlogging during 1988 and 1999 reflect intensification of agricultural activity. A substantial decrease in waterlogging during 2006 is attributed to the implementation of government wasteland reclamation measures. The area statistics of waterlogging computed for the buffer zone along select features showed that the maximum waterlogging occurs along canals and railways followed by rivers and the least along roads.

AB  - Quantifying and evaluating effects of best management practices (BMPs) on water quality is necessary to maximize the effectiveness of BMPs for minimizing pollutants. Watershed-scale evaluation of effects of BMP implementation on fecal bacteria and sediment yield can be estimated using a watershed water quality model, and strategies for identifying critical areas in a watershed can be pollutant specific. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was used in the Upper Wakarusa watershed (950km²) in northeast Kansas to explore effectiveness of vegetative filter strip (VFS) lengths applied at the edge of fields to reduce non-point source pollution. The Upper Wakarusa watershed is a high priority total maximum daily load (TMDL) designation watershed for fecal bacteria in Kansas. This study characterizes fecal bacteria sources (human, livestock, and wildlife) and targets VFS to abate sediment and fecal bacteria pollution from the Upper Wakarusa watershed. Objectives of this study were to test the effectiveness of VFS lengths (0, 10, 15 and 20m) for removing overland process sediment and fecal bacteria concentration, rank sub-watersheds after determining sediment and fecal bacteria contribution of each sub-watershed, and demonstrate the SWAT model's ability to evaluate effectiveness of VFS application to abate sediment and fecal bacteria using targeted and random approaches to select 10, 25 and 50% of the sub-watersheds. The 15-m VFS reasonably reduced fecal bacteria concentration in the watershed. The greatest difference between the target and random approaches to fecal bacteria reduction was at 50% VFS adoption; the target approach removed about 60% of fecal bacteria, and the random approach removed about 42%. For sediment yield, the greatest reduction was at 25% VFS adoption; the target approach removed about 63% of sediment yield, and the random approach removed about 33%. A targeted watershed modeling approach using SWAT was effective at reducing both fecal bacteria concentration and sediment yield.

AB  - This paper presents a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based spatial analysis scheme to account for spatial patterns and association in geological thematic mapping with multiple geological data sets. The multi-buffer zone analysis, the main part of the present study, was addressed to reveal the spatial pattern around geological source primitives and statistical analysis based on a contingency table was performed to extract information for the assessment of an integrated layer. Mineral potential mapping using multiple geological data sets from Ogdong in Korea was carried out to illustrate application of this methodology. The results obtained from the case study indicated that some geochemical elements and residual magnetic anomaly dominantly affected spatial patterns of the mineral potential map in the study area and the dominant classes of input data layers were also extracted. This information on spatial patterns of multiple geological data sets around mines could be used as effective evidences for the interpretation of the integrated layer within GIS.

AB  - In Korea, where the plain land is greatly deficient as a mountainous nation, most of riparian zones were transformed into agricultural fields and urban areas. Excessive use of the land, which is close to river, makes the rivers enduring severe pollution stresses. Disappearance of riparian buffer, which plays a function of filter in the riverside, appears as a main factor aggravating water pollution of rivers. In this respect, it is imperative to restore the lost riparian vegetation. This study found out restoration models of riparian vegetation from the Bongseonsa stream, which has remnant riparian vegetation patches as a conservation reserve. Feasible reference information applicable for restoration of riparian vegetation was shown in the species level in the order of herb, shrub, and tree and sub-tree zones as far away from the waterway. Those information could contribute to restoring integrate and healthy rivers and streams beyond simple landscaping differently from the other restoration projects when they will be applied to the restoration project to be carried out in the future. In addition, the spatial range of river and stream, background that riparian zone disappeared in Korea, and application plan of the obtained reference information were discussed.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been used worldwide for many hydrologic and Non-Point Source (NPS) Pollution analyses on a watershed scale. However, it has many limitations in simulating the Vegetative Filter Strip (VFS) because it considers only ‘filter strip width’ when the model estimates sediment trapping efficiency and does not consider the routing of sediment with overland flow which is expected to maximize the sediment trapping efficiency from upper agricultural subwatersheds to lower spatially-explicit filter strips. Therefore, the SWAT overland flow option between landuse-subwatersheds with sediment routing capability was enhanced by modifying the SWAT watershed configuration and SWAT engine based on the numerical model VFSMOD applied to South-Korean conditions. The enhanced SWAT can simulate the VFS sediment trapping efficiency for South-Korean conditions in a manner similar to the desktop VFSMOD-w system. Due to this enhancement, SWAT is applicable to simulate the effects of overland flow from upper subwatersheds to reflect increased runoff volume at the lower subwatershed, which occurs in the field if no diversion channel is installed. In this study, the enhanced SWAT model was applied to small watersheds located at Jaun-ri in South-Korea to simulate a diversion channel and spatially-explicit VFS. Sediment can be reduced by 31%, 65%, and 68%, with a diversion channel, the VFS, and the VFS with diversion channel, respectively. The enhanced SWAT should be used in estimating site-specific effects on sediment reduction with diversion channels and VFS, instead of the currently available SWAT, which does not simulate sediment routing in overland flow and does not consider other sensitive factors affecting sediment reduction with VFS.

AB  - The flow of chemical materials along spatial elements is a fundamental aspect of landscape ecology. The research renders indicators for water pollution, which are utile for functional water management and land use planning. Ecologists identify mechanisms of nutrients transfer and mitigate their environmental impacts using freshwater wetlands and riparian buffers. In order to estimate the N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) loss risk, current research combines indicators into index models. The objective of this work was to review the factors of transport from upland source areas to surface water as N and P indicators, and to report on the magnitudes of N and P fluxes in agricultural landscapes under temperate climate. We reviewed the ISI Web of Science for recent developments on N and P transport factors and nutrient index models, and we suggested how to improve these schemes. We presented conceptual diagrams of N and P transport. Catchment-scale index models use factors of contributing distance, connectivity, soil properties, and erosion as indicators. P losses are mainly dependent on overland flow conduits and barriers, whereas subsurface flows control N more. Riparian vegetation accumulates great N and P amounts, while it is usually just a temporary sink. Riparian soil is a smaller but a more permanent store, whereas it may turn to a nutrient sink, too, when saturated. Anaerobic soil microbes denitrify somewhat less N, while this process is irreversible, and therefore equally crucial. In spite of this, most nutrient index models do not consider wetlands and riparian buffers. Hence we suggest to include the removal capacity of the riparian buffer zone in both catchment N and P index models. In general, we propose a landscape framework, which considers upland source areas, transit, and hydric riparian landscape elements as a single system.

AB  - Dans le cadre de la jachere (gel volontaire puis obligatoire), le proprietaire du domaine des Baillis (Loiret) a seme des bandes enherbees en 1990 a base de graminees et de legumineuses pour favoriser la reproduction du petit gibier (faisan de colchide (Phasianus colchicus), et perdrix rouge (Alectoris rufa)). Une estimation quantitative des biomasses lombriciennes, Lumbricidae, a ete realisee par la methode d'echantillonnage de Bouche et Aliaga (1986). La biomasse observee est de 1700 kg/ha soit 34 fois plus que celle de la parcelle contigue cultivee chaque annee en culture de vente. Un temoin compose essentiellement de graminees issues du semis de 1990 a ete conserve. Sur les 200 metres de la bande enherbee restante de 10 metres de large, il a ete applique cinq conduites differentes: desherbage en totalite, broyage periodique, desherbage avec un herbicide a spectre large mais non persistant, temoin precedent bordee d'une bande desherbee d'un metre au sulfosate pour limiter l'extension des adventices, semis volontaire d'especes a cycle long avec maintien d'une bande desherbee d'un metre, semis volontaire d'especes a cycle moyen avec maintien d'une bande desherbee d'un metre. Les resultats de ces differentes conduites sont analyses en termes de diversite floristique, de site de reproduction et d'alimentation pour la faune sauvage, de controle des adventices indesirables et de couts comparatifs des differents modes de conduite. Les trois dernieres pratiques permettent de satisfaire aux exigences de la faune sauvage et de controler le developpement des adventices indesirables. De plus, elles presentent un cout et une contrainte supportables pour l'agriculteur. A la lumiere de ces resultats, on souhaite que les bords de parcelles soient integres dans le gel obligatoire ou volontaire impose par le volet maitrise des excedents de la PAC a partir d'une largeur minimale de 10 metres. L'Union europeenne ne considere pas eligible au titre du gel, les parcelles de largeur inferieure a 20 metres et de surface inferieure a 0,3 ha. Ces bandes enherbees constituent un moyen efficace pour reduire l'erosion et limiter les transferts de produits phytosanitaires vers les eaux de surface comme l'ont montre les travaux du Cemagref, Centre d'etude du machinisme agricole, du genie rural, des eaux et des forets, de l'ITCF, l'lnstitut technique des cereales et des fourrages. Elles offrent des sites de nidification, d'abri et d'alimentation pour la faune sauvage

AB  - Pesticide pollution is one of the main current threats on water quality. This paper presents the potential and functioning principles of a “Wet” forest buffer zone for reducing concentrations and loads of glyphosate, isoproturon, metazachlor, azoxystrobin, epoxiconazole, and cyproconazole. A tracer injection experiment was conducted in the field in a forest buffer zone at Bray (France). A fine time-scale sampling enabled to illustrate that interactions between pesticides and forest buffer substrates (soil and organic-rich litter layer), had a retarding effect on molecule transfer. Low concentrations were observed for all pesticides at the forest buffer outlet thus demonstrating the efficiency of “Wet” forest buffer zone for pesticide dissipation. Pesticide masses injected in the forest buffer inlet directly determined concentration peaks observed at the outlet. Rapid and partially reversible adsorption was likely the major process affecting pesticide transfer for short retention times (a few hours to a few days). Remobilization of metazachlor, isoproturon, desmethylisoproturon, and AMPA was observed when non-contaminated water flows passed through the forest buffer. Our data suggest that pesticide sorption properties alone could not explain the complex reaction mechanisms that affected pesticide transfer in the forest buffer. Nevertheless, the thick layer of organic matter litter on the top of the forest soil was a key parameter, which enhanced partially reversible sorption of pesticide, thus retarded their transfer, decreased concentration peaks, and likely increased degradation of the pesticides. Consequently, to limit pesticide pollution transported by surface water, the use of already existing forest areas as buffer zones should be equally considered as the most commonly implemented grass buffer strips.

AB  - As part of a European LIFE ArtWET project, two on-site buffer zones, an artificial wetland and a forest plot, are being evaluated for their capacity to mitigate pesticide pollution. As treatment efficiency is highly dependent on the systems' hydrology, the present work focuses on the watershed and both systems' hydrological functioning. The design strategy involved limited inlet flow rates to 70 L s–1: 99% of watershed outlet flow rates were lower than this limit. Approximately half of the flows of greatest concern passed through the artificial wetland, whereas the forest only received 2% of these flows. A tracer experiment was conducted under a low steady flow rate while little vegetation was present in the artificial wetland. A water dye tracer (sulforhodamine B, SB) and two molecules of contrasting properties, uranine (Ur, photodegrading) and isoproturon (mobile and only slightly sorptive, IPU) were injected. Dilution, sorption, and photodegradation were observed. The forest plot, which presented a high organic matter content, showed more sorption (IPU, SB) but lower photodecay (Ur) than did the artificial wetland. Total IPU losses in the forest buffer were high (79%). In the artificial wetland, 30% IPU losses were found, whereas a 66.5-h mean retention time was determined and good hydraulic efficiency (0.55) was calculated. Few dead zones and short-circuits were found, suggesting good hydrological functioning. Implementing buffer zones in subsurface pipe-drained watersheds actively participates in the reduction of pesticide transfer to natural water bodies.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the potential of Chiang Mai city to develop a buffer area outside of the protected area of Doi Suthep-Pui National Park by analysis of physical data related to land use. It will cover factors such as characteristics and type of land use, information, the suitability of the soil, topography, waterways and irrigation etc. By studying data from documents and field surveys, researchers found that the area in close proximity to Doi Suthep-Pui National Park is a marginal area of the city and exclusively sensitive as it affects the conservation area. However, currently there are no buffer areas to allow impact protection against these harmful affects to the conservation area. Even with regard to the maintenance of a green belt to prevent the urban growth of the city, there are no clear substantial guidelines in place. Various agencies are focusing on problem solving on this issue and land use activities consistent with the region's physical potential. It is, therefore, possible to determine directives and guidelines for conservation and development in keeping with the concept of buffer zone management, ecological land use and so on based on the concept of sustainable use of natural resources with buffer zones and conservation areas within the forest area of the park and outside the protected areas, in which the urban planning could have damaging effects. For spatial development strategies in areas with specific development goals, cooperation and integration into government policies is necessary, to study the potential of the region and consider the needs of the community.

AB  - Mixing unfamiliar individuals is a common practice in livestock production systems. However, a change in social structure can create social stresses, which can adversely affect animal welfare and reduce production. In this study, social interaction metrics were used to investigate interaction and behavioural differences between familiar and unfamiliar pairs. These differences were used to characterise features of the familiarisation process between pairs of unfamiliar steers. Proximity loggers quantified the frequency and duration of close proximity encounters between animals while visual observations evaluated the distance and movement between individuals within pairs and described their behaviour. Fifteen pairs of familiar steers and 15 pairs of unfamiliar steers were observed over 5 weeks. Each pair was monitored for 5 days in a 3ha paddock with contact between adjacent pairs prevented by a 20m buffer zone. Unfamiliar pairs initially maintained further distance apart than familiar pairs, but after 3 days their distances were similar to familiar pairs. Unfamiliar pairs had increased (P <0.05) movement towards and away from each other while familiar pairs tended to spend more (P <0.10) time lying and standing and less (P <0.05) time grazing than unfamiliar pairs. The results confirm that familiarity affects proximity between pairs of steers and that differences in behaviour and movement patterns between familiar and unfamiliar pairs emphasise the disruptive effect of introducing new individuals. The decrease in proximity between unfamiliar pairs over time suggests familiarisation between pairs begins early (after 3 days). However, overall familiar pairs had more close proximity encounters per hour than unfamiliar pairs (3.8 and 2.3contacts/h, respectively, P <0.01) and showed a tendency to spend more time lying and standing than unfamiliar pairs; these differences were constant over the 5-day period indicating that complete familiarisation had not occurred within 5 days.

AB  - Part of the puzzle surrounding biodiversity loss lies in an incomplete understanding of how humans value the functions and services that flow from biodiversity conservation projects. This paper takes a closer look at the links between the conservation of biodiversity and the livelihoods of rural people who live on the fringes of the parks and protected areas. We revisit some of the key aspects of ecosystem valuation--purpose, methodology, and policy design and implementation--because the links between biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and human welfare are obscured by considerable smoke and mirrors. Using a biodiversity conservation project (Ruteng Park) on Flores Island in Indonesia as a case study, we build a concrete empirical example of ecosystem valuation. This conservation project has resulted in spatially patchy watershed protection that allows us to identify and estimate the impacts of watershed services on human health (diarrhea prevalence) in the buffer zone of the park. We conclude by offering a plan of research to improve the design of conservation interventions for protecting biodiversity and providing ecosystem services. These recommendations include developing more conceptual knowledge on the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem services; scaling up valuation efforts of underappreciated services such as health; shifting focus from valuing services individually to valuing multiple benefits from the same area; and conducting conservation policy experiments to identify causal outcomes (including defensible estimates of ecosystem values).

AB  - For many populations and species, population viability analysis (PVA) plays a critical role in developing defensible conservation strategies and recovery plans. Although technical aspects of PVA have been well scrutinized, misapplication of PVA and misinterpretation of its results have received less attention. To illustrate potential hazards of improper use of PVA we reanalyzed data from a recent study on viability of wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (APP), Ontario, Canada. The original PVA predicted extirpation of wolves from APP and prompted both a ban on wolf harvesting in a 10-16km buffer zone surrounding the 7571km² park and an intensive research program to evaluate efficacy of the ban. Our reanalysis showed that limited and imprecise wolf population density and demographic rate estimates, as well as flawed population assessment and reconstruction methods, led to overly pessimistic evaluation of wolf population status in APP. In fact, our analyses suggest that wolves in APP are unlikely to decline significantly over the next 20 years. Further, contrary to earlier conclusions we suggest that rapid wolf population recovery following protection from human exploitation would be likely and readily detectable. These findings highlight the need for adequate data, appropriate methodology, and proper analytical context when conducting PVA. Because the original PVA prompted substantial redirection of staff and financial resources from other significant conservation initiatives, we conclude that improper PVA may undermine execution of effective wildlife management and ultimately provide a disservice to conservation biology.

AB  - At this study, an environmental impact assessment was investigated on Query mining at Chegeni area in west of Khorramabad .After collection of data and analysis of findings, the positive and negative impacts resulted from Query mining were determined, matrix and scaling checklist methods were used to assess impacts . The environmental parameters likely to be affected by mining are related to many factors, i.e., physical, social, economic, agriculture and aesthetic. Mining involves extraction of underneath minerals, traffic network, and other vehicular movements, dumping of waste, drilling and blasting along with other operations. All the operations can be disturbed environment of the area in various ways, such as removal of mass, change of landscape, Annoyance of human settlement, flora and fauna of the area, surface drainage, changes in air, water and soil quality. However, there is need for mining, but these have to be environmentally friendly. Significant conclusions emerging out of this study are: Mining and related activities have significant impact on soil, land use, water, air, noise, flora, fauna, health, safety and aesthetics of the site area and its periphery, the impacts(exception of aesthetics) are marginal or negligible in the buffer zone. However, mining have any major beneficial impacts on socioeconomic conditions of the entire region. Total environmental impact score of mining for the area is (-429.6)that indicating major injurious impact on environment. Since, mining is location specific activity, major environmental control measures are required to be taken for mitigation of hazards, restoration of natural ecosystem and sustainable development of the mining area. Few remedial measures are suggested for sustainable development of the area and reducing environmental disturbances.. Query mining at Chegeni is a classic example of unscientific mining and improper waste disposal regardless of aesthetics, proper land use practices etc. Mining practices prevalent in the area need to be reviewed.

AB  - Off-target glyphosate deposits were measured downwind of aerial silvicultural applications which used D8-46 hollow-cone hydraulic nozzles. 'Micronair' AU 5000 rotary atomisers, and the 'Thru Valve Boom' (030), with volume application rates of 35, 20 and 20 litre ha-1 respectively, and a glyphosate application rate of 2.1 kg ha-1. Crosswind spray lines were released 10 m above ground level over a short forest canopy, from a fixed-wing aircraft flying at 45 m s-1 in atmospheric boundary layers with average wind speeds and air temperatures of 2.2-3.7 m s-1 and 8-23 degrees C at release height. Ground sheets and artificial foliage clusters were exposed at downwind distances of between 50 and 300 m. Glyphosate deposit measurements at various downwind distances (x) were fitted with non-linear regression lines, deposits were attenuated at rates inversely proportional to x at powers of 1.3-2.3. For a particular trial, deposits on ground sheets and artificial foliage were generally similar, and ranged between 19 and 0.04 mg m-2 over the sampling distances used. For 100-ha applications the estimated buffer-zone widths around water bodies were less than 50 m, whereas those around non-target vegetation ranged between 75 and 1200 m, depending on the application method and the meteorological conditions.

AB  - Ant species assemblages have been used as biological indicators of environmental condition in many different ecosystems. To assess the potential of using ants as environmental indicators of agroecosystem condition, ants were collected from a stratified random sample of agricultural fields planted in annually harvested herbaceous crops at 90 sites in North Carolina and Virginia. The ants were identified to species and correlations with soil, management and crop variables were examined as the 1st step in developing an environmental indicator of agroecosystem condition. A total of 41 species of ants was found. Ant species assemblages were found to differ significantly between the fields and the field margin. Ant species assemblages were correlated with soil variables, tillage practices, and insecticide use, suggesting that ants have potential as a biological indicator of agroecosystem condition

AB  - Arable weeds are a key component of the biodiversity of agroecosystems, but have faced a marked decline due to agricultural intensification. Recently, the crop edge has been considered as a potential refugia for many species. Indeed, weed species richness and abundance are higher in the crop edge than in the field margin and the field core. In this study we question whether weed functional diversity also varies among field elements and whether it is higher in the crop edge. We studied the interspecific and intraspecific variation of three functional traits (specific leaf area, canopy height and above-ground biomass) related to the response of weeds to competition and to agricultural practices, for seven weed species sampled in the crop edge, the field margin and the field core area in four winter-wheat fields. We show that trait values varied significantly with the species, the field element and their interaction. Within the field, all species had high specific leaf area, low canopy height and biomass, suggesting a shade-tolerance syndrome that could be a strategy in response to both competition with the crop and the disturbances induced by agricultural practices. In the crop edge, where the functional variation was the highest, two distinct functional strategies were observed, suggesting a resource partitioning under the predominance of weed–weed competition. In conclusion, the crop edge plays a key role in sustaining weed diversity, mostly because of its intermediate environmental properties that allow the coexistence of weeds with different ecological strategies.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity on forest landscapes dominated by plantations has become an increasingly important topic, and opportunities to maintain or enhance biodiversity within these forests need to be recognized and applied. Riparian buffers of mature forest retained along streams in managed forest landscapes offer an opportunity to enhance biodiversity across these landscapes. However, influence of buffer width and structure of adjacent plantations on habitat use by birds is not well understood. We modeled probability of occupancy, while accounting for variable detection probabilities, for 16 bird species of regional conservation importance in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We examined occurrence of breeding birds in streamside management zone (SMZ) buffers embedded in three structural classes of pine plantation: young open-canopy, closed-canopy, and older thinned plantations. Our occupancy models included a positive association with SMZ width for nine bird species associated with mature forests. Models for three early successional species (prairie warbler [Dendroica discolor], white-eyed vireo [Vireo griseus], and northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus]) included a negative association with SMZ width. Occupancy models for Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), summer tanager (Piranga rubra), pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), prairie warbler, and northern bobwhite also included structural condition of adjacent plantations, but most species did not appear affected by condition of surrounding plantations. We found diverse responses among species to width of retained SMZs and structure of adjacent plantations; some species apparently benefitted from SMZs >100 m wide, while others benefitted from narrow buffers. Furthermore, most species traditionally associated with mature forests were common in narrow SMZs, regardless of width. Thus, optimal width of SMZs relative to avian conservation depends on the species of greatest conservation interest.

AB  - It is generally recognised that agricultural intensification has lead to simplification of landscape structure, but it has not been clarified if this is a ubiquitous relationship. That is, it has been an open question whether agricultural intensity and landscape simplicity should be regarded as one single or as two separate dimensions. To evaluate this we analysed landscape data in 136 different 1km×1km study sites and within a buffer zone of 2km around each site (i.e. approximately 5km×5km). The sites were distributed over a large part of the region of Scania, southernmost Sweden, an area dominated by agriculture but with large variation in both intensity and complexity. We used spatially explicit digital data on land use, digitised aerial photographs, field surveys of landscape elements and agricultural statistics. Two separate factor analyses, one for each scale of measurements (1km and 5km), suggest that there are five and three relevant factors for each scale respectively. At the 1km scale, the first factor can be interpreted as describing the intensity of land use in the form of proportion arable land which is highly correlated to crop yield. The second and third factors are more connected to landscape structure and amount of small patches of semi-natural habitats. The fourth and fifth factors contain one major variable each: proportion pasture and leys respectively. The division of intensity and complexity related variables is less clear at a larger spatial scale. At the 5km scale, factor 1 is defined almost identically as at the 1km scale. However, factors 2 and 3 are interpreted as descriptors of dairy and livestock farming systems but also include structural variables. Our analyses suggest that land use intensity and structural complexity of landscapes are more or less separate landscape level factors, at least at smaller spatial scales. This is important to bear in mind, especially when trying to explain patterns of biodiversity change in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since biological degradation processes are known to be a major driver of the natural attenuation of pesticide residues in the environment, microbial communities adapted to pesticide biodegradation are likely to play a key environmental role in reducing pesticide exposure in contaminated ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the diuron-mineralising potential of microbial communities at a small-scale watershed level, including a diuron-treated vineyard (pollution source), its associated grass buffer strip (as a river protection area against pesticide runoff) and the lotic receiver hydrosystem (sediments and epilithon), by using radiorespirometry.RESULTS: Comparison of results obtained at different sampling sites (in both soil and aquatic systems) revealed the importance of diuron exposure in the adaptation of microbial communities to rapid diuron mineralisation in the vineyard but also in the contaminated grass strip and in downstream epilithic biofilms and sediments.CONCLUSION: This study provides strong suggestive evidence for high diuron biodegradation potential throughout its course, from the pollution source to the final receiving hydrosystem, and suggests that, after microbial adaptation, grass strips may represent an effective environmental tool for mineralisation and attenuation of intercepted pesticides.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodid ticks play an important role in the transmission and ecology of infectious diseases. Information about the circulation of tick-borne bacteria in ticks is lacking in Ecuador. Our aims were to investigate the tick species that parasitize Andean tapirs and cattle, and those present in the vegetation from the buffer zone of the Antisana Ecological Reserve and Cayambe-Coca National Park (Ecuador), and to investigate the presence of tick-borne bacteria. METHODS: Tick species were identified based on morphologic and genetic criteria. Detection of tick-borne bacteria belonging to Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Borrelia genera was performed by PCRs. RESULTS: Our ticks included 91 Amblyomma multipunctum, 4 Amblyomma spp., 60 Rhipicephalus microplus, 5 Ixodes spp. and 1 Ixodes boliviensis. A potential Candidatus Rickettsia species closest to Rickettsia monacensis and Rickettsia tamurae (designated Rickettsia sp. 12G1) was detected in 3 R. microplus (3/57, 5.3%). In addition, Anaplasma spp., assigned at least to Anaplasma phagocytophilum (or closely related genotypes) and Anaplasma marginale, were found in 2 A. multipunctum (2/87, 2.3%) and 13 R. microplus (13/57, 22.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of Rickettsia sp. in ticks from Ecuador, and the analyses of sequences suggest the presence of a potential novel Rickettsia species. Ecuadorian ticks from Andear tapirs, cattle and vegetation belonging to Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera were infected with Anaplasmataceae. Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were not found in any ticks.

AB  - Headwater streams are an important and prevalent feature of the eastern North American landscape. These streams provide a wealth of ecosystem services and support tremendous biological diversity, which is predominated by salamanders in the Appalachian region. Salamanders are ubiquitous throughout the region, contributing a significant biomass that supports ecological and ecosystem processes. One of the greatest threats to salamanders is loss of headwater-riparian habitat through timber harvest. In this study, we measured larval salamander abundance at five headwater streams with different riparian buffer widths retained following logging. By sampling larval salamanders using leaf litter bags, we assessed the impacts of even-aged timber harvest on aquatic larval salamander abundances, where it was found that larvae are negatively impacted by increased stream sedimentation and a decrease in riparian buffer width. We found that retention of a 9-m buffer was effectively no different than complete removal of all riparian forest, and as such, current regulations to protect headwater streams are ineffectual. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the 30m buffer treatment and uncut control treatments suggesting that a 30m or larger riparian buffer may assuage the in-stream effects of riparian timber harvest.

AB  - Reducing pesticide use in agriculture is necessary to preserve natural resources. However, pest control without pesticides is a challenging issue. In particular, weed infestation may cause severe losses of crop yield. Weeds have been traditionally managed solely at the field level. However, larger scales must be considered because invasive and herbicide-tolerant weeds are spreading over larger scales. This review discusses three spatial scales at which agricultural management might affect the dispersal of weeds and, in turn, their distribution and abundance in agricultural fields. The main points are: (1) at the field level, crop and margin management impact mass effect, i.e., local exchanges between the field margin and the cultivated field; (2) at the farm level crop allocation, the management of field boundaries and agricultural circulation in the farm strongly impact the intensity and direction of weed dispersal; and (3) at the landscape level, the spatial farms distribution controls the distribution of weed habitat and, in turn, landscape species pool and long-distance weed dispersal. We conclude that weed dispersal is driven by agricultural management at multiple scales. Weed scientists should thus extend their view on weed dispersal from within-field scales to among-field and landscape scales.

AB  - This paper examines the role of population density on land use allocation and change. We are especially interested in the management of fallow areas that have come under increasing pressure given restrictions imposed by the creation of protected areas like national parks. It is argued that these restrictions to reduce deforestation create a relative scarcity of land, and applies insights about the management of fallows from Boserup's classic work on agricultural intensification and population growth. This paper examines land use in the Cerro Azul Meambar National Park in Honduras. Land use allocation is evaluated using data from a social survey of 600 farms in the Park's buffer zone, and land use classifications based on Landsat satellite images. Change in land use is analyzed by comparing satellite image-based land use classifications in 1993 and 1999. The analysis indicates that differences in population density are an important factor in explaining land use allocation and change. Whether in areas of high population density or low, fallow areas are reduced when land is scarcer. In areas of low population density, reforestation efforts associated with Park management lead to the displacement of fallows. In areas of high population density fallows give way to more intensive land uses.

AB  - For achieving a high-quality and efficient management of forest ecosystems (Pentek et al. 2010), it is necessary to provide an optimally distributed network of primary and secondary forest road infrastructure. The openness of forest areas, the need to describe the existing situation and the tendency to rationalize the existing road network were described with traditional openness (density of forest roads). Traditional openness is a well-known parameter that has represented the size of the basis determined by the level of the achieved existing primary and secondary road density for a long time in forestry. In many previous researches, different authors described the current state with traditional openness of the secondary forest road network (Rebula 1983, Zdjelar 1990). Traditional openness is a numeric data that says little about the quality of road distribution on the observed areas. It represents only the quantity and distribution of primary and secondary forest roads. The transitional form of themodern view of the subject matter is a combination of traditional openness andmean skidding distance (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007). Relative openness has, lately, (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007) been increasingly used as a variable that describes more precisely and accurately the actual state of forest road infrastructure and defines the need for further opening of forests. The basic terrain characteristics (Šikić et al. 1989) such as relief altitudes, slopes and indented terrains determine the terrain configuration such as: the plain, hilly and mountainous terrains. Generally, relief and terrain can also be divided into plain and bumps, where the plains are – lowlands and plateaus, and bumps are – elevations (hills, highlands, mountains) and troughs (valleys, basins, river basins). The relative openness is both a quantitative and qualitative parameter (Pentek 2010), which gives a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, and expresses the ratio of surface forest area opened by forest roads and the total forest area in percentage terms. It is the parameter that (Pentek 2002), with a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, gives the possibility of establishing open and unopened areas, and offers to designers the option of choosing the most appropriate version of forest road routes. The relative openness is determined by the buffer method and the procedure consists in laying down the buffered areas around the forest road infrastructure. Primary and secondary relative openness can be distinguished depending on the category of forest roads. The secondary relative openness provides information on quantity and spatial distribution of secondary forest road network. The procedure of determining the secondary relative openness is very similar to the process of determining the primary relative openness, but for the calculation of the buffer zone width around skid roads, skid trailsor cable-yarder lines, the mean skidding distance is not taken into account. Depending on applied timber harvesting technologies, the following parameters can be used:• winch rope length,• forwarder cranes,• length of the cable yarder rope for sideward skidding.The primary forest road infrastructure is taken into consideration when calculating the secondary relative openness because the components of the primary forest road infrastructure can be used in winching roundwood. The importance of the quality of spatial distribution of secondary forest roads (skid roads and skid trails) is determined by the fact that with the same density of secondary roads, if their distribution is bad, the distance of timber extraction is twice bigger than when their distribution is carefully defined (Knežević 1980, Rebula 1981, Rebula 1983). The secondary forest opening depends on the relief area in which the procedure of fine opening is carried out, as well as on the applied (possible) timber harvesting technologies. On flat terrains, which allow skid road and skid trail routes to be laid out perpendicular to the contour lines, forest areas are opened in the shape of a rectangle network, i.e. components of secondary forest road network are separated from the primary components at right angle, and the components of lower order are also separated from those of higher order at right angle, within the network of secondary forest roads. Laying out the network of secondary forest roads in the plain area is not a major problem due to the fact that tractors can move in all directions, which makes the performance of the procedure very simple; no excavating is required, but only removing the stumps of cut trees. Here the system of secondary forest roads is represented through skid trails, which are in fact the defined timber extraction routes – the so called – parallel pattern. On subhilly and hilly terrains with developed hydrographic network and indented relief interlaced with coves and ditches, skid roads and skid trails, adapting to and following the terrain configuration, crawl along the waterways and bays, and at final parts of the watercourses they can be branched in fan-shaped pattern, in the so-called plumose pattern and fishbone pattern. In mountainous areas with large slope, skid roads and skid trails are developed on the slopes following them in an appropriate, allowable, positive longitudinal upward inclination – fishbone pattern. In karst terrain with abundant karst phenomena, particularly sinkholes, the routes of skid roads should be laid out on passes between sinkholes, and in other parts of the forest area they must be adapted to the relief configuration. Laying out skid roads in sinkholes is not justified because of uphill timber skidding, especially from deep sinkholes with steep slopes – irregular pattern. The research area was the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar«, Forest Office Perušić, Forest Administration Gospić. It is an integral part of North Velebitmassif, extending in the east to west direction. Due to its location and altitude, it is considered a high mountain area. The total area of forest management units amounts to 2,413.14 ha. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are the steep mountainous terrain and indented, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 20–40°. These features suggest the need for good primary and secondary forest openness. The annual allowable cut (26.36 m3/ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness of the completeManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar« is 9.97 m per ha, while the openness of secondary forest roads is only 26.74 m per ha. If only the selected area is taken into consideration, then the primary openness is 27.13 m per ha, while the secondary openness is 45.19 m per ha. Researches were carried out in the selection forests of the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume«, Forest Office Opatija, Forest Administration Buzet. The total area of management units is 1,950.87 ha. TheManagement Unit »Veprinačke šume« is part of the mountain Ćićarija. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are steep and indented mountainous terrain, rich with karst phenomena, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 5–30°. Based on these features, the need for an effective primary and secondary openness is obvious. The annual allowable cut (41.59 m3/ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness is 8.58 m/ha, or 16.78 m/ha, if the old Italian public road with a superstructure made of crushed gravel is taken into account. The secondary openness is 101.94 m/ha. The objectives of this study were defined through the following phases of work:• establishment of the secondary forest road cadastre,• analysis of the secondary relative openness for the selected skidder winch rope length,• designing (development) of the secondary forest road network.In the selected subcompartments of the ManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar«, 123 skid roads were investigated of a total length of 46,656 m. The research area covers 942.10 hectares and the secondary openness with skid roads is 49.52 m per ha. In the analysis of the secondary relative openness, the value of access to an area of 45 m was chosen based on the skidder winch rope length.Due to the terrain slope and surface barriers, the selected winch rope length was corrected by 10% because of the increased directional felling. The analysis of conditions in the selected subcompartments of the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar« showed a lack of the secondary relative openness. In order to achieve excellent secondary relative openness, a fine opening of further research areas was done for the selected winch rope length. When improving (upgrading) the existing network of secondary forest roads, the winch rope length of less than 45mwas selected as relevant, with the aim of providing work humanization and adapting to the demanding terrain conditions. For this version, a high number of conceptual routes were designed – 83 new skid roads of a total length of 46,438.91 m. The newly designed secondary forest road network reached the secondary relative openness of 90.47%, by which excellent openness was achieved. Such secondary relative openness was achieved with a density of only 106.88 m per ha of skid roads. The terrain of the observed area is mountainous and this is why the whole management unit was not taken into consideration. The rest of the management unit is extremely steep and has a protective character. The mountainous terrain is quite steep, but only slightly indented and rather unchanging, which explains the smaller traditional openness required to achieve excellent secondary relative openness than was the case in the previous studies (Jeličić 1983, Rebula and Zdjelar 1983, 1990). Asignificant contribution to a more efficient network of the secondary forest roads is provided by the application ofmodern technologies andmethods in the planning of secondary forest roads. Surveys conducted in the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume« cover 1,326.10 ha of forest area and include 629 skid roads of a total length of 152,893.44 m. The reason for such a large number of skid roads lies in the fact that the terrain is mountainous, very indented with a large amount of karst phenomena, and hence a higher number of skid roads is necessary because of large terrain indentation. In the researched area the existing secondary relative openness is very good (according to Pentek 2002), and it amounts to 83.13%. Traditional secondary openness is 134.39 m per ha, and it includes the primary roads: the public roads and forest roads with skidding possibilities. The secondary relative openness was determined for three different skidder winch rope lengths: 30, 45 and 60 meters. The chosen winch rope length was decreased by 10% because of the terrain slope and surface barriers. The surface barriers, spatial distribution of standing trees in the stand and directed trees felling were also taken into consideration. The corrected values were increased by the average value of timber assortments because it is enough to reach only the top of an individual assortment to increase the total area of reach of a tree. Designing new conceptual routes had to be done to improve the existing secondary road network to an excellent level of the secondary relative openness, which was achieved with 42 new skid roads of a total length of 14,332 m. The secondary relative openness in this case amounts to 90.13%, and the road density is 144.12 m per ha. In the Republic of Croatia harvesting is done by ground machinery, cable-yarders are very rare, and helicopters and other forms of air transport are not applied. Therefore, good primary and especially secondary forest openness by forest roads is extremely important. Comparing the results with previous studies in similar conditions (Rebula 1983 and Zdjelar 1990), the optimal secondary relative openness was achieved with less total length of secondary forest roads. A similar result was obtained by research of the terrain with similar characteristics in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Jeličić 1983), according to which secondary openness of 100 m per ha was recommended in even-aged forests and up to 200 m per ha in selection forests. In earlier studies (Pentek et al. 2008), in similar terrains, secondary forest road network optimization has been done for a various number of winch rope lengths: 30, 40, 50 and 60 meters. Due to terrain conditions, horizontal barriers, existing secondary forest road network and in order to provide work humanization, the winch rope length of 40 m was selected. The current secondary relative openness was 78.42%. By designing 23.03 km of new skid roads, an excellent secondary relative openness of 90% has been achieved with the traditional secondary openness of 113.47 m per ha. Comparing the results with previous studies (Pičman and Pentek 2003), taking into account the particularities of individual research areas, results in constantly developing methods for estimating the existing and optimizing future networks of secondary forest roads, thus achieving an excellent secondary relative openness with lower density of secondary forest roads. Planning a network of secondary forest roads is significantly determined by the existing secondary forest road infrastructure, which often directs further opening. The analysis of the current situation showed that the forest area is opened by the existing network of secondary roads two or even several times more than necessary, thus reducing the efficiency coefficient of the existing road network. This is the result of unsystematic forest opening in the past. It is therefore very important to use the modern methods of forest opening in the forest areas where the procedure of fine opening has been applied from the start, or where the secondary openness is very bad.

AB  - It is common practice in the United States and elsewhere to maintain vegetated filter strips adjacent to streams to retain contaminants in surface runoff. Most research has evaluated contaminant retention in managed agricultural field strips, while relatively few studies have quantified retention in forested filter strips, particularly for dissolved contaminants. Plot-scale overland flow experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of natural forested filter strips established as streamside management zones (SMZs) for retaining phosphorus (P), atrazine, and picloram transported in runoff. Retention was evaluated for five different slope classes: 1-2, 5-7, 10-12, 15-17, and 20-22%; two cover conditions: undisturbed forest floor (O horizon intact) and forest floor removed by raking; and two periods with contrasting soil moisture conditions: summer-dry and winter-wet season. Surface flow was collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 m within the filter strip to evaluate changes in solution concentration as it moved through the O horizon and the surface soil horizon mixing zone. On average, a 10 m length of forested SMZ with an undisturbed forest floor reduced initial solution concentration of total dissolved P by 51%, orthophosphate P by 49%, atrazine by 28%, and picloram by 5%. Percentages of mass retention through infiltration of water plus concentration reductions in runoff were 64% for total dissolved P, 62% for orthophosphate P, 47% for atrazine, and 28% for picloram for undisturbed forest floor conditions. Lower retention occurred following forest floor removal, particularly for P. Average dissolved P retention was 16% lower following forest floor removal. For undisturbed sites, differences in retention were more closely related to forest floor depth than to slope or antecedent soil moisture. These results indicate that forested SMZ filter strips provide a significant measure of surface water protection from dissolved P and herbicide delivery to surface water.

AB  - Indices quantifying spatial forest structure are frequently used to monitor spatial aspects of tree attributes including biodiversity in research plots of limited size. The treatment of edge trees, which are close to the plot boundaries, can affect the estimation of such indices that include neighbour effects, since some of their neighbours are likely to fall outside the plot. This paper investigates whether and under what circumstances edge-correction methods are necessary and evaluates the performance of six different approaches: no edge correction, translation, reflection, buffer zone, and two new nearest-neighbour methods. The performance of edge-correction methods depends strongly on the algorithmic structure of the indices and the spatial pattern of tree positions involved. Some edge-correction methods introduce more error than ignoring edge bias altogether. For indices accounting for the diversity of tree positions and especially for those computing angles, translation or buffer zone methods reduce the estimation error regardless of the sample size. The use of the reflection method is associated with large bias values. One of the new nearest-neighbour edge-correction methods proves to be capable of reducing the bias considerably. The results confirm the need for sufficiently large monitoring plots to avoid bias from edge effects. Where this is impossible, neighbours beyond the plot boundary need to be included in the survey, thus providing unbiased estimates but at the cost of extra measurements. Sensitivity analysis is required for newly introduced indices prior to their first application.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems deliver services that are crucial to human existence and well-being, yet, globally, their degradation has outpaced remedial management. Rivers can be subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures and agricultural land use is one major cause of water pollution and habitat degradation in European rivers. The Water Framework Directive is a major legislative driver for good ecological status in Europe's rivers and in the UK; this has led to attempts to reduce the negative effects of agriculture on rivers through agri-environment schemes (AES). AES are funded from tax revenue and it is important that they are optimized to deliver measurable ecological improvements. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological effectiveness of AES in a lowland English river basin. We examined the effect of distance from river in optimizing AES for the biological heath and conservation value of rivers. We used aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of river health and conservation value, to assess the effects of AES likely to improve river health (hereafter “AES river options”). This catchment in lowland England had a very high (over 80%) level of uptake of entry level AES, and facilitated a comparison between schemes that do or do not contain AES river options. The conservation value of macroinvertebrate communities and the proportion of macroinvertebrates intolerant of water pollution and sedimentation increased with high proportions of woodland within 100m or 500m of the river throughout the entire upstream catchment. High proportions of AES river options within the same distance were correlated with higher proportions of sediment-sensitive macroinvertebrates. We conclude that for improving biological quality or promoting the conservation value of river communities, AES will be optimized by preserving woodland within a 100–500m buffer zone along the upstream length of the river.

AB  - 1. Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. 2. Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. 3. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. 4. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe.

AB  - From 1907 when the fever tick eradication campaign began until 1933, the tick eradication methods of dipping cattle in an acaricide or “pasture vacation” were enormously successful in eradicating southern cattle ticks [Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini)], until failures began to occur in some areas of Florida. Regarding the failures in Florida, the consensus was that populations of white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann)] infested with southern cattle ticks were responsible. After numerous deer in several counties were killed, eradication was achieved in Florida. As in Florida, in Texas increasing numbers of failures of the pasture vacation approach to tick eradication from the 1970s to the present are known to be related to the abundance of white-tailed deer and perhaps other wild ungulate species. A sizable body of evidence confirms the hypothesis that white-tailed deer support the dispersal and maintenance of both cattle ticks [Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (Say)] and southern cattle ticks (cattle fever ticks) within the permanent quarantine or buffer zone in South Texas along the Rio Grande, as well as in the so-called free (“cattle fever tick-free”) area north and east of the buffer zone and extending to the east coast of the United States. As of August 2009, in addition to the permanent quarantine zone of approximately = 2,233 km2, three temporary preventative or blanket quarantines were established. Currently, only two methodologies exist to control ticks feeding on white-tailed deer: 1) a systemic treatment method involving dispersal of ivermectin-medicated corn, Zea mays L.; and 2) two topical treatment methods, `4-poster' deer treatment bait stations and `2-poster' deer treatment feeder adapters, both of which passively apply topically active acaricide to deer for the eradication of populations of cattle fever tick associated with white-tailed deer. This study presents and summarizes confirmational support for the role of white-tailed deer derived from historical accounts, circumstantial evidence from review of recent infestations, and cattle fever tick infestations on white-tailed deer that were live-captured and examined specifically for cattle fever ticks.

AB  - The history of brackishwater pond culture in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia has been associated with mangrove loss because in earlier times, the larger society has viewed mangroves and other wetlands as wastelands to be developed. In a proactive move to address environmental concerns over shrimp aquaculture, the SEAFDEC Council in 1999 mandated the development of environment-friendly shrimp culture and the build-up of expertise in mangroves.This paper reviews the status of mangroves and their conversion to culture ponds in Southeast Asia, and the environmental impacts of aquaculture, aside from habitat loss. To improve the sustainability of brackishwater aquaculture, recommendations include an inventory of mangrove and pond culture areas in the region, zonation of mangrove areas within the context of integrated coastal zone management, aqua-silviculture and environmentfriendly aquaculture, rehabilitation of degraded mangroves, and enforcement of existing laws including the buffer zone/mangrove greenbelt requirement.

AB  - Seeds of the dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex Engelm., explosively discharged from plants parasitizing 40- to 60-year-old jack pine trees (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), were collected on cheesecloth traps at two sites in Grand Beach Provincial Park at 2-h intervals during daylight hours. Microclimatic variables were continuously recorded during the discharge period. Seeds were recovered up to 18 m from the canopy margin. Seasonal fluctuations in numbers of seeds trapped were attributed in part to fungal hyperparasitism of fruits and high spring temperatures. The spatial distribution of seeds was strongly leptokurtic, with most landing within 12 m of the canopy margin. Neither the onset nor the distance of discharge could be ascribed to any single microclimatic parameter. With one apparent exception, no discharge occurred during the hours of darkness. The number of seeds trapped rose rapidly between sunrise and 11:00 central standard time, when temperature was increasing and relative humidity was falling. Stepwise regression analysis confirmed that change in relative humidity was predominantly responsible for the diurnal periodicity of seed discharge. Based on our observations, we recommend a minimum 20-m buffer zone to protect pine regeneration from A. americanum infected residual trees.

AB  - Achieving high recovery efficiency is a goal for almost all aquifer storage recovery (ASR) wells, whether storing fresh water in brackish aquifers or in fresh aquifers containing native water quality constituents that are not wanted in the recovered water. This goal can be achieved rapidly by initial formation and maintenance of a target storage volume (TSV) that includes the water volume required for recovery plus a buffer zone volume that separates the stored water from the surrounding native groundwater. The buffer zone volume is a one-time addition of water to the well. An ASR demonstration project was constructed and tested at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA, storing drinking water in a brackish limestone, semi-confined, artesian aquifer. Operating performance has confirmed the viability of this TSV approach for development of ASR wells. The stored drinking water was recovered at a flow rate of 8 Ml/D for 126 days, with an ending chloride concentration of 170 mg/l, rapidly achieving 100 % recovery efficiency. The storage aquifer had a chloride concentration of 685 mg/l. Results have since been replicated at two other ASR wells on Hilton Head Island, addressing the expected loss of all remaining fresh public water supply wells on the island due to saltwater intrusion. ASR well cycle testing in which the same volume is stored and recovered, with progressively larger storage volumes in each successive cycle, is appropriate for geochemical and microbial studies but is inappropriate for determination of recovery efficiency since any buffer zone is removed during each cycle.

AB  - A science-based geographic information system (GIS) approach is presented to target critical source areas in watersheds for conservation buffer placement. Critical source areas are the intersection of hydrologically sensitive areas and pollutant source areas in watersheds. Hydrologically sensitive areas are areas that actively generate runoff in the watershed and are derived using a modified topographic index approach based on variable source area hydrology. Pollutant source areas are the areas in watersheds that are actively and intensively used for such activities as agricultural production. The method is applied to the Neshanic River watershed in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The capacity of the topographic index in predicting the spatial pattern of runoff generation and the runoff contribution to stream flow in the watershed is evaluated. A simple cost-effectiveness assessment is conducted to compare the conservation buffer placement scenario based on this GIS method to conventional riparian buffer scenarios for placing conservation buffers in agricultural lands in the watershed. The results show that the topographic index reasonably predicts the runoff generation in the watershed. The GIS-based conservation buffer scenario appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional riparian buffer scenarios.

AB  - This report is the second in a series of   studies on transport and aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan   Africa. It follows a study on transport costs and prices   along the main international trade corridors (Teravaninthorn   and Raballand 2008). One of the principal findings of the   research on international corridors in Africa was that   trucking market structure and regulation differ widely among   sub-regions in Sub-Saharan Africa; therefore, transport   prices (but not necessarily transport costs)1 differ greatly   among sub-regions and corridors. The trucking environment   and market structure in West and Central Africa are   characterized by cartels offering low transport quality,   whereas in East Africa, the trucking environment is more   competitive and the market is more mature. Much of the   transport price burden along African corridors seems to   depend on the political economy of freight logistics.

AB  - 1. Agricultural intensification has contributed to severe declines in odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) populations. The objective of our study is to benefit current measures for the conservation of odonates by establishing the conditions favourable to Odonata and focusing on ponds within agricultural land. 2. Our landscape‐scale study used exuvial counts and habitat measurements from 29 ponds across a catchment in England, over 3 years, to determine key factors affecting odonate abundance and species richness. 3. Ponds dominated by floating and submerged vegetation were the most transparent, supported the highest abundance and species richness of exuviae, and were always fully or partially surrounded by buffer strips. Ponds lacking vegetation were turbid, yielding no exuviae even if they were buffered. English agri‐environment schemes (AES) currently support pond and buffer strip creation and management. 4. Abundance of exuviae was higher in recently created ponds compared to older ponds, whereas ponds that had dried out the previous summer had fewer exuviae. 5. Species richness of exuviae decreased with increasing distance to the nearest viable pond, falling by more than 40% for distances over 100 m. 6. We conclude that odonate conservation would be more effective if AES would consider the spatial scale at which ponds are created and the location, type, and quality of ponds targeted for buffer strips.

AB  - In recent years, new tools for funding nature conservation have been designed. Because poverty is often significant in areas with high biodiversity, the improvement of local livelihoods is frequently considered as a secondary goal of new financing mechanisms besides nature conservation. The buffer zone of the Podocarpus National Park in Ecuador is such a high biodiversity zone. In this paper, we compare the cost-effectiveness and development potential of three different mechanisms to finance nature conservation implemented in this buffer zone, namely (a) an organic coffee label, (b) the Socio Bosque Program, a nationwide payment scheme for private forest conservation, and (c) FORAGUA, a regional water fund. This paper describes the functioning and the scope of the mechanisms and analyses their environmental and socio-economic impacts which are compared to the total costs. Results show that the water fund has the highest additionality in ecosystem service provision, while the payment scheme is the most cost-effective both for current as for increased ecosystem service provision and for extra rural job creation. Organic coffee certification has the highest positive impact on rural income creation.

AB  - Most of the studies on invasive species are disproportionately focused on their ecological effects and more investigations are needed to understand the effects of invasive plants on rural livelihoods. This study assesses the effects of the invasion of Mikania micrantha—an invasive vine—on the livelihoods of the buffer zone community forest users of Chitwan National Park, Nepal. In this study, the invasive plants are categorized based on their life-form (woody and non-woody) and mode of introduction (accidental or deliberate). The focus is on accidentally transported non-woody species. A household survey revealed that the invasion disproportionately affects the livelihoods of forest-dependent households. In addition, the livelihood effects of invasive plants are particularly determined by the suitability of the invasive plants to produce locally important forest products.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how rural people in the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park in Nepal perceive the effects of accidently transported invasive plant species, such as Mikania micrantha, Lantana camara and Chromolaena odorata, on their livelihoods. We found that their perception of the impact of each species on their livelihood varies with factors such as the duration of the presence of invasive plants in the landscape, and household characteristics. Results of a household survey indicate that farm households close to the forests have responded to the invasive species both as a victim and a beneficiary. Farm households are likely to adapt to the invaded environment as they have a history of interacting with invasive plants and can commoditise them through appropriate intervention. Additionally, the findings indicate that rural people are willing to invest in the control and management of invasive plants if appropriate technical assistance is available. Without assistance, they consider mitigating the infestation an unattainable mission and consider acceptance of the invasive species as a part of the rural ecosystem an inevitable outcome.

We build a stylised model todetermine the optimum buffer width and apply it to the Karapiro catchment. Themodel can easily be extended to model salinity removal, conservation reserveprogrammes, establishing wetlands and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Sediment and nutrients losses from agricultural lands have been identified as a significant environmental problem. Vegetative filter strips are commonly used as a best management practice (BMP) to control agricultural pollution. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that grass filter strips were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient exportations in runoff from grazed pastures amended with irrigated dairy manure. The experiment was carried out under conventional management practices in a dairy farm in Puerto Rico. Natural runoff events were diverted into runoff collection devices placed at 0, 10, and 20 m within a grass filter barrier. Collected samples were analyzed for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Dissolved Phosphorus (DP), and Total Phosphorus (TP). TSS concentrations in runoff entering the filter strips were minimal, indicating that TSS losses are not significant from pasture fields exhibiting high vegetative coverage. The higher TP and TKN concentrations were observed in runoff events occurring within 10 days after manure application. That condition is an indication that the schedule of manure applications should be avoided during periods when significant rains are expected, because direct runoff will result in excessive nutrient losses if no filter strip is present. In both fields, DP concentrations in runoff were significantly reduced with a filter strip 20 m wide, whereas TP concentrations were significantly reduced only from the field exhibiting the highest concentration in runoff. Although the 20 m filter strip reduced the TKN concentration up to 27% from the evaluated fields, such reduction was non-significant. The implementation of 20 m grass filter strips are effective in preventing extraordinary nutrient losses from manure amended fields, however, the incorporation of other BMPs are needed to reduce nutrient losses to levels that do not reduce the quality of receiving waters.

AB  - The colonisation process of carabid beetles from field margins to crop fields under organic agriculture was investigated in 2010 and 2011 in northern Germany in order to find the supporting effects of grassy strips in the agricultural landscape. Displacement and speed of Pterostichus melanarius, Carabus auratus and Poecilus spp. were higher in the crops than in the grassy strips, except for the speed of C. auratus. Among the four species C. auratus, P. melanarius, Pterostichus niger, and Poecilus spp., C. auratus revealed the highest displacement and speed, whereas no significant differences were found between the other three species. P. melanarius showed higher displacement and speed in wheat than in red-clover or pumpkin. Speed and displacement of P. melanarius differed between spring and autumn generations in wheat or red-clover. When they were released at a junction of arable crop and field strips, C. auratus moved indifferently to either arable field or field margins/strips, whereas P. melanarius moved directly to crop centres. At the field margin, Poecilus spp. preferred to move along a grassy strip, while it moved irrespective from the grassy strips in a central site. C. nemoralis and P. niger preferred to move within the grassy strips. Our studies reveal that grassy strips do not affect the dispersal of typical arable field species; however, the species demanding grass vegetation can only overcome the barriers of arable fields either by grassy strips alone or by grassy strips with an adjacent hedge.

AB  - Field studies were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 to determine the effectiveness of several grasses as filter strips for reducing sediment and herbicide losses in runoff. Big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and tall fescue reduced total runoff volume by at least 55, 76, 49, and 46%%, respectively. Within the 127-d sampling period, each perennial grass filter strip investigated reduced total sediment loss in surface runoff by at least 66%%. All four species reduced total fluometuron loss in runoff at least 59%%. Big bluestem and eastern gamagrass reduced norflurazon loss in runoff 63 and 86%%, respectively. When a filter strip was present, fluometuron and norflurazon losses did not exceed 5 and 3%% of the total applied, respectively, compared to 12 and 5%%, respectively, when a filter strip was not present.Nomenclature: Fluometuron; norflurazon; big bluestem, Andropogon gerardii Vitman; cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. ‘‘DES-119’’; eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides L.; switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., PANVI; tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., FESAR.

AB  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to compare the adsorption and desorption of fluometuron between two soils, one collected from an eastern gamagrass filter strip and the other from a cropped field. Fluometuron adsorption to soil collected from the filter strip was higher than to soil collected from the cropped field. Kd values for fluometuron ranged from 1.9 to 3.6 for soil from a cropped area, compared with 2.9 to 5.3 for soil from the filter strip, indicating a weak to moderate binding affinity for fluometuron. The total fluometuron desorbed ranged from 48 to 79%% of that adsorbed, most of which (50 to 59%% of the total amount desorbed) occurred during the first desorption cycle with both soils. Approximately 11%% less fluometuron desorbed when a filter strip was present. Results indicate that eastern gamagrass filter strips can influence adsorption––desorption processes between fluometuron and a Brooksville silty clay soil by altering the soil properties, specifically soil organic matter.Nomenclature: Fluometuron; eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides L.

AB  - 1. Wildlife reintroductions can help to restore populations and save species from extinction. However, success rates of reintroductions are low due to inherent problems, such as behavioural deficiencies resulting in high post‐release predation rates among captive‐bred animals. In particular, the released animals may use habitats maladaptively, leading to an ecological trap, i.e. preference for low‐quality habitats leading to reduced survival and/or breeding success. Ecological traps in reintroductions can be identified only through intensive studies of habitat preferences and survival of known individuals, but such studies are lacking. 2. We investigated habitat preferences and their relationship with survival by radio‐tracking reintroduced, captive‐bred grey partridges Perdix perdix, a widely reintroduced commercial game species and native farmland bird of conservation concern in the UK. The low success rate of grey partridge releases could be due to maladaptive habitat use and a possible ecological trap. 3. Grey partridges released as pairs in spring showed preferences for crop and field margin habitat. The use of crops had a positive, and use of field margins a negative, association with survival, suggesting field margins could serve as ecological traps for released grey partridges. Predation rates were high, and field margins probably hosted concentrated predator activity. 4. Grey partridges released as family groups (coveys) in autumn exhibited a preference for game covers, i.e. areas of tall vegetation specifically planted to provide cover for game birds, and mortality rates were lower than in spring. Habitat use did not affect survival in autumn. 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that newly released grey partridge pairs behave maladaptively by preferring a habitat which has a negative association with survival. In grey partridge reintroductions, we recommend releasing grey partridge family groups in autumn rather than releasing pairs of birds in spring, and providing game covers that could induce the groups to settle onto the release areas. In reintroductions in general, the habitat preferences of the released animals should be documented together with their fates, to enable detection of possible ecological traps that could threaten the success of these conservation efforts.

AB  - Riparian zones can provide a protective buffer between streams and adjacent land-based activities by removing nitrate from shallow groundwater flowing through them. Hydrological factors are an important influence on the effectiveness of riparian buffer zones in reducing pollutant loads delivered to streams. In this paper, we present results from a study of the hydrology of two riparian buffers belonging to an ephemeral and a perennial stream, which are part of a research project to study nitrogen transport and transformation processes in shallow groundwater in South-East Queensland, Australia. The investigation at the ephemeral site has shown that a shallow perched water table forms shortly after stream flow commences as a result of lateral flow from the stream to floodplain; it resides within the carbon-rich root zone and drains off after stream flow ceases. The low head gradient of 1% results in a low flow rate of about 6 cm/day along the floodplain, slow enough to allow effective removal of nitrate via denitrification to occur. The investigation at the perennial site has shown that water table dynamics within the floodplain are dissociated from the up-slope area except during over-bank flood events. During non-event conditions, there is low streamward gradient that results in a base flow component to the stream; the water table depth is about 3.5 m, hence missing most of the carbon-rich soils located close to the soil surface. During flood events, a reverse gradient towards the floodplain is formed; the streamward gradient is re-established after the flood wave passes. The water table fluctuates between 1.8 and 3.5 m under these conditions thus having a higher chance of interacting with more active floodplain sediments. Water stored in the floodplain has a residence time of 2-10 days, providing an opportunity for denitrification to reduce nitrate concentrations prior to water draining back to the stream.

AB  - The notion of ecosystem services as presented by P.R. Ehrlich and A.H. Ehrlich (1981) concerns not only services but also goods which are acquired thanks to the functioning of ecosystems. For ecological economy, the different concepts constitute a foundation for methodological assumptions pertaining, in fact, to determining the subject of research. From the legal perspective, a service is a conduct performed by a debtor whose goal is to fulfil a legal duty to the satisfaction of the creditor. Accepting this definition in the evaluation of the environmental-human relationship, the environmental-human service is based on the following: on giving something (Lat. dare), doing something (facere), not doing (non facere) and bearing something (pati). The identification and evaluation of services are significant reasons supporting nature arguments when making economic decisions, especially in making decisions concerning localization. The goal of this work is to determine, in categories of dare, facere, non facere and pati, the relationships between the natural environment, including ecosystems, and human behaviour in the Wielkopolska National Park in Poland and within its buffer zone boundaries. The Wielkopolska National Park buffer zone areas are currently among the most urbanised areas of Wielkopolska. In many places, this buffer zone is no longer a barrier limiting negative influences of human economy on the national park. Economic rules and administrative boundaries have nothing in common with the ecosystem and landscape boundaries, so it is possible to introduce and perform services for ecosystems of the national park (dare) using a protection plan.

AB  - In this article we compared the response of surface water runoff to a storm event for different rates of urbanization, reforestation and riparian buffer setbacks across forty subwatersheds of the Muskegon River Watershed located in Michigan, USA. We also made these comparisons for several forecasted and one historical land use scenarios (over 140 years). Future land use scenarios to 2040 for forest regrowth, urbanization rates and stream setbacks were developed using the Land Transformation Model (LTM). Historical land use information, from 1900 at 5-year time step intervals, was created using a Backcast land use change model configured using artificial neural network and driven by agriculture and housing census information. We show that (1) controlling the rate of development is the most effective policy option to reduce runoff; (2) establishing setbacks along the mainstem are not as effective as controlling urban growth; (3) reforestation can abate some of the runoff effects from urban growth but not all; (4) land use patterns of the 1970s produced the least amount of runoff in most cases in the Muskegon River Watershed when compared to land use maps from 1900 to 2040; and, (5) future land use patterns here not always lead to increased (worse) runoff than the past. We found that while ten of the subwatersheds contained futures that were worse than any past land use configuration, twenty-five (62.5%) of the subwatersheds produced the greatest amount of runoff in 1900, shortly after the entire watershed was clear-cut. One third (14/40) of the subwatersheds contained the minimum amount of runoff in the 1960s and 1970s, a period when forest amounts were greatest and urban amounts relatively small.

AB  - SpraySafe Manager (SSM) is a computer-based aerial application model, which unlike previous models, has a simple user interface. SSM not only predicts spray deposition but also integrates this data with herbicide-plant dose-response curves. This latter facility allows the operator to predict the size of buffer zone required to avoid damage to sensitive plants outside the spray area and the degree of weed control within the spray block. Validation trials showed that, for a helicopter applied spray, the model tended to overpredict spray deposition on stainless steel plates close to the spray block and underpredict deposition in the region 32-80 m from the centre of the spray release line and on isolated plants. The accuracy of model prediction was greater when the spray was applied using D8-45 nozzles orientated at 90 degrees, than for spray applied using D6 nozzles orientated at 0 degrees. The reasons for this are discussed. The model can also be used to predict possible work rates, hectares sprayed per hour, and potentially as a training tool.

AB  - It is commonly believed that colonization of early-season cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., by overwintered boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, is concentrated on field margins. However, supporting experimental evidence is not available. In 1999 and 2000, we examined colonization patterns of overwintered boll weevils in Central Texas cotton on the bases of adult collections by a pneumatic sampler and hand collections of abscised infested squares. Samples were taken from sites arranged in a grid that extended inward >70 m from the field margin. Adults were collected from shortly after seedling emergence until the flowering stage, and infested squares were collected during the one-third grown square stage. Despite numerical trends, the numbers of adult weevils collected were not significantly different between years or sexes, or among plant phenological stages. Field-to-field variation among collections was considerable and likely prevented detection of differences among these factors. Spatial patterns represented by adult weevil and infested square collections were examined by logistic regressions fitted to the respective probabilities of weevil detection at each designated sample site. Although we observed trends for slightly decreased probability of weevil detection with increased distance from the field margin, these trends were too weak to be demonstrated statistically. Our results indicate the boll weevil does not consistently exhibit a strong edge-oriented colonization pattern, and that management tactics that are predicated on these patterns, such as border sprays, should be used with caution.

AB  - The aim of the article was to emphasize importance of solutions for buffer zones (region adjacent to a protected area partly serving as a protection against negative influences of the area itself)of small-scale protected areas with forest phytocenoses as the subject of the protection. Buffer zones often play remarkable role in the management of protected areas. Recently, loss of the buffer zone functionality is observed more frequently which implies negative impact on the subject of the protection. The legislation concerning nature protection in the Czech Republic does not define fundamentals of buffer zones. This contribution describes possible handling of buffer zones. Ecosystem approach was used, showing benefits of buffer zones for increasing ecological stability of a protected area: reduction of border effect, increasing surface of protected area (natural forest is not able to keep its structure on a small region), founding of biocoridors, decreasing occurence of invasion species and support of development of metapopulations (important to preserve species with high ability for motion and orientation). At the close the author proposes some methodic how to evaluation the buffer zones around protected areas.

AB  - Filter strips are areas of herbaceous vegetation planted between agricultural fields and streams. In 2002 and 2003, the butterfly community in filter strips of a variety of widths and vegetative compositions was studied. Transect surveys were used to quantify butterfly abundance and diversity and measured vegetative variables in conjunction with each butterfly survey round. Overall butterfly diversity (H') and abundance of habitat-sensitive butterflies were positively correlated with filter strip width. Using stepwise regression, the best models to explain butterfly abundance included the coverage of forbs and the number of ramets in bloom in the strips, and indicated positive relationships between forbs and the butterfly community (R2 = 0.33 and 0.07, respectively). The models that best explained abundances of large, habitat-sensitive butterflies included the height and vertical density of vegetation. The planting of forbs in filter strips is rare, but may be useful for providing food sources to butterflies.

AB  - In this paper, the current knowledge on mitigation strategies to reduce pesticide inputs into surface water and groundwater, and their effectiveness when applied in practice is reviewed. Apart from their effectiveness in reducing pesticide inputs into ground- and surface water, the mitigation measures identified in the literature are evaluated with respect to their practicability. Those measures considered both effective and feasible are recommended for implementing at the farm and catchment scale. Finally, recommendations for modelling are provided using the identified reduction efficiencies. Roughly 180 publications directly dealing with or being somehow related to mitigation of pesticide inputs into water bodies were examined. The effectiveness of grassed buffer strips located at the lower edges of fields has been demonstrated. However, this effectiveness is very variable, and the variability cannot be explained by strip width alone. Riparian buffer strips are most probably much less effective than edge-of-field buffer strips in reducing pesticide runoff and erosion inputs into surface waters. Constructed wetlands are promising tools for mitigating pesticide inputs via runoff/erosion and drift into surface waters, but their effectiveness still has to be demonstrated for weakly and moderately sorbing compounds. Subsurface drains are an effective mitigation measure for pesticide runoff losses from slowly permeable soils with frequent waterlogging. For the pathways drainage and leaching, the only feasible mitigation measures are application rate reduction, product substitution and shift of the application date. There are many possible effective measures of spray drift reduction. While sufficient knowledge exists for suggesting default values for the efficiency of single drift mitigation measures, little information exists on the effect of the drift reduction efficiency of combinations of measures. More research on possible interactions between different drift mitigation measures and the resulting overall drift reduction efficiency is therefore indicated. Point-source inputs can be mitigated against by increasing awareness of the farmers with regard to pesticide handling and application, and encouraging them to implement loss-reducing measures of “best management practice”. In catchments dominated by diffuse inputs at least in some years, mitigation of point-source inputs alone may not be sufficient to reduce pesticide loads/concentrations in water bodies to an acceptable level.

AB  - The distribution and morphological characteristics of channels were mapped in a redwood forest at Caspar Creek, California, USA, to evaluate the extent to which recent logging has influenced channel conditions in the area. In the North Fork Caspar Creek watershed, second-cycle logging of the early 1990s appears to have triggered increased coalescence of discontinuous gullies within clearcut tributary watersheds, and upstream channel limits in logged watersheds are now located significantly farther upslope than in control watersheds. The magnitudes of observed increases in peakflow after logging are consistent with the change in drainage density. Relations between channel morphological variables and indices of stream power are less well-defined in logged watersheds than in controls, suggesting that logging may have led to disruption of previously established channel forms. Correlations between suspended sediment yields and indices of gully erosion suggest that in-channel erosion associated with hydrologic change is an important source of post-logging sediment at Caspar Creek. Common sediment-control measures, such as use of riparian buffer strips and reduction of road surface erosion, would not be effective for reducing sediment input from this source.

AB  - Protected areas are considered essential elements for global biodiversity conservation. They may not necessarily result in an effective conservation of resources in developing countries due to lack of funding for management and enforcement. In addition, poor governance aligned with conflicts of economic interests related to their use can further threaten their integrity and persistence. In the Dominican Republic, the western beaches of the Jaragua National Park (JNP), a protected area which is also part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, have been proposed for development using a mass-tourism model. One of the most charismatic species found in this area is the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). In the present study, we assess hatching success, and factors affecting it, to determine the reproductive value across the area for the leatherback turtle. The main factors found driving hatching success at the study beaches are beach sector, incubation duration, date of lay and clutch size. Our results show that clutches in La Cueva (located in the buffer zone of the park) and Bahía de las Águilas (located inside the limits of the park) have an unusually high hatching success (~75� %) for this species, highlighting the importance of increasing protection efforts at these sites. We strongly recommend including La Cueva inside the limits of the JNP.

AB  - Living and detrital biomass in a riparian buffer zones ameliorate diffuse-source pollution originating from adjacent landscapes, with higher nutrient removal potential, particularly with respect to nitrogen and sediments, associated with more biomass (i.e., older forests). Pollution removal is mediated by sediment trapping and uptake of nitrogen by plants and by denitrification by microbial communities in root zones using organic matter and root exudates as energy sources. However, as a consequence of various land management activities, the amount of biomass of most forest riparian zones is much lower than its potential, which is mature forest. This makes restoration of riparian buffer zones to mature forest an ideal way to both improve water quality and increase carbon sequestration. This study measures the amount of biomass aboveground and in soils for a variety of common, age-related condition-types associated with riparian buffer zones along low order (headwater) streams in agricultural landscapes of Coastal Plain North Carolina. The data are used to determine pollution removal potential in relation to stand age and distance from channel and a basis for developing an indicator of riparian condition. Mean biomass for common riparian cover types were Mature Forest (>50 y old): 483Mg/ha; Young Forest (25–50 y old): 257Mg/ha; Regenerating Forest (5–25 y old): 205Mg/ha; recently Harvested Forest (0–5 y old): 165Mg/ha; Perennial Herb: 67Mg/ha; Shrub/Sapling: 63Mg/ha; and Annual Rowcrop: 36Mg/ha. Trees contained >96% of all aboveground biomass and >58% of total biomass present in the forested conditions. Biomass in recently harvested forests were >97% detrital, mostly due to the large amount of slash left after harvesting and the mostly intact soil organic matter. Most (>80%) of the biomass in non-forest cover types was stored in the detrital pool. By partitioning the riparian zone into inverse distance-weighted subzones based on distance from stream channel, we developed an indicator for determining riparian condition based on both biomass and proximity of biomass to channel.

AB  - Water availability, use and quality in a rural watershed of the Colombian Andes were investigated through participatory research involving local youth. Research included the quantification of disaggregated water use at the household level; comparison of water use with availability; monitoring water quality of streams, community water intakes and household faucets; and the determination of land use - water quality interactions. Youth were involved in all aspects of the research from design to implementation, dissemination of results and remediation options. Quantification of domestic and on-farm water use, and water availability indicated that water availability was sufficient during the study period, but that only an 8% decrease in dry season supply would result in shortages. Elevated conductivity levels in the headwaters were related to “natural” bank erosion, while downstream high conductivity and coliform levels were associated with discharges from livestock stalls and poorly maintained septic tanks in the stream buffer zone. Through the involvement of youth as co-investigators, the knowledge generated by the research was appropriated at the local level. Community workshops led by local youth promoted water conservation and water quality protection practices based on research, and resulted in broader community participation in water management. The approach involving youth in research stimulated improved management of both land and water resources, and could be applied in small rural watersheds in developed or developing countries.

AB  - The maintenance of uncultivated field margins and the creation of new field margin strips are standard agri-environmental measures aimed at enhancing above-ground biodiversity, but their effects on below-ground biodiversity (in margins and also in-field) are insufficiently known. This study compared earthworm communities in permanent (grassy) margins, newly created field margin strips (unsown) and in-field in five arable fields in Ireland over a 3-year period. Permanent field margins initially supported highest earthworm abundance, biomass and species richness compared to the newly created margin strips and in-field at three conventional and two minimum (conservation) tillage sites. However, after three years, mean earthworm populations in the newly created margin strips (371±181individualsm⁻² and 91.9±41.7gbiomassm⁻²) approached those observed in the permanent margins (470±47individualsm⁻² and 126.5±14.7gbiomassm⁻²) in the three conventional tillage field sites. By contrast, overall mean population sizes inside conventionally tilled fields were 155±46individualsm⁻² and 38.3±12.5gbiomassm⁻². Similar trends were observed at the two minimum tillage sites. Permanent field margins supported somewhat larger mean species numbers compared to in-field at conventional and minimum tillage field sites, but most species still occurred, at significantly lower abundances, inside fields. Spatially defined transect sampling (at 1, 3, 10 and 50m in-field) at all study sites did not provide evidence for increased populations nearer to the margins or margin strips, even under reduced cultivation. It is concluded that permanent and newly created margin strips in arable systems support larger earthworm populations than are found in-field, but field margins did not appear to enhance in-field populations through colonisation or spill-over effects documented for more mobile, above-ground invertebrate taxa.

AB  - Water pollution from nonpoint sources is increasingly a focal point for efforts to reduce water quality impairments. These efforts often require or subsidize riparian buffer strips. However, the costs of these buffer strips are not always well understood. This article estimates the annualized costs of establishing and maintaining 45.7-meter (150-feet) riparian buffer strips on all agricultural land adjoining a waterway in Tennessee's Harpeth River watershed. A mandatory requirement for buffer strips of this width would result in 4,955 hectares (12,245 acres) of buffer strips at an annualized cost of $1.3 million. A supply curve for buffer strips is also constructed.

AB  - The Colombian environmental policy voted in 1993, which was to strengthen the protection of natural resources - particularly biodiversity and water - is totally unfavorable to farming in the strategic páramo ecosystem. However, many rural development practitioners and researchers believe that an integrated management of the páramo is possible, and that farming activities can be part of the solution along this agriculture-conservation frontier. This issue has become particularly acute on the Rabanal páramo (western cordillera), in Colombia, where the projected expansion of a core protection zone will soon include major areas currently used for agriculture and settlements. Although family farmers have been living there for decades, the environmental authorities are focused on prohibiting farming activities in the entire protection area. A study of local history and aerial photos indicates that this zone has been a dynamic part of local farming systems since at least the 1950’s and that the páramo has evolved from a subsistence farming area to a zone that now includes intensive potato production conducted by external entrepreneurs. Their presence is mainly due to the need of family farmers for a cost effective solution to maintain the productivity of their pastures. Through a process of interviewing participants in the debate, as well as mapping land use in the area use for agriculture that will be soon included into the protection area, objectives for action were developed that would result in more sustainable farming practices, thus enhancing the conservation of the páramo biodiversity and water resource.

AB  - Forest harvesting activities, if not carefully carried out, can disturb the forest soils and can cause significant suspended solid concentration increases in receiving water. This study examined how harvesting, following forestry guidelines, influenced suspended solid concentrations and loads in the receiving water of a blanket peat salmonid catchment. The study site comprised of two forest coupes of 34-year-old conifers drained by a first-order stream. The upper coupe was not felled and acted as a baseline ‘control’ catchment; the downstream coupe was completely harvested in summer 2005 and served as the ‘experimental’ catchment. Good management practices such as the proper use of brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented to minimize soil surface disturbance and streambank erosion. Stream flow and suspended solid measurements at an upstream station (US) and a downstream station (DS) in the study stream commenced over a year before felling took place. The suspended solid concentrations, yields and release patterns at US and DS were compared before and after harvesting. These showed that post-guideline harvesting of upland blanket peat forest did not significantly increase the suspended solid concentrations in the receiving water and the aquatic zone need not be adversely affected by soil releases from sites without a buffer strip.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the release of phosphorus (P) to receiving waters resulting from harvesting 34-year-old lodgepole pine trees in an upland peat catchment. The study site was within a 25.3-hectare (ha) area, and was drained by a stream that received flows from ploughed furrows, mainly, via collector drains, and discharged directly to the salmonid Shrahrevagh River, Burrishoole, Co. Mayo, Ireland. The study site was divided in two parts: the upstream part was left intact and the downstream part was harvested in early Autumn 2005 following implementation of forest guidelines. Good management practices such as proper use of brash mats and harvesting only in dry weather were implemented. Two instrumented stations were established – one just upstream (US) and the other just downstream (DS) of the clearfelled area. The measurement of P concentrations at the two stations commenced in May 2005, two months before the harvesting started. The daily mean P concentration at the DS station increased from about 6 μg L-1 of total reactive phosphorus (TRP) during pre-clearfelling to 429μg L-1 in August 2006. By October 2009, four years after clearfelling, the P concentrations at the DS station had returned to pre-clearfelling levels. In the first three years after harvesting, up to 5.15 kg ha-1 of TRP were released from the harvested catchment to the receiving water; in the second year alone, 2.3 kg ha-1 of TRP were released. Linear regression can be used to describe the relationship between TRP load and water discharge. About 80 % of the total phosphorus (TP) in the study stream was soluble and more than 70 % of the P release occurred in storm events, indicating that traditional buffer strips with widths of 15-20 m might not be efficient for P immobilization. The P concentrations were affected by antecedent weather conditions and highest concentrations occurred during storm events following prolonged drought periods. The water extractable phosphorus (WEP) contents in the soil were significantly higher below windrow/brash material than in brash-free areas, and whole-tree harvesting should be studied as one of the means to decrease P export from blanket peats.

AB  - We assessed the influence of land cover at multiple spatial extents on fish assemblage integrity, and the degree to which riparian forests can mitigate the negative effects of catchment urbanization on stream fish assemblages. Riparian cover (urban, forest, and agriculture) was determined within 30 m buffers at longitudinal distances of 200 m, 1 km, and the entire network upstream of 59 non-nested fish sampling locations. Catchment and riparian land cover within the upstream network were highly correlated, so we were unable to distinguish between those variables. Most fish assemblage variables were related to % forest and % urban land cover, with the strongest relations at the largest spatial extent of land cover (catchment), followed by riparian land cover in the 1-km and 200-m reach, respectively. For fish variables related to urban land cover in the catchment, we asked whether the influence of riparian land cover on fish assemblages was dependent on the amount of urban development in the catchment. Several fish assemblage metrics (endemic richness, endemic:cosmopolitan abundance, insectivorous cyprinid richness and abundance, and fluvial specialist richness) were all best predicted by single variable models with % urban land cover. However, endemic:cosmopolitan richness, cosmopolitan abundance, and lentic tolerant abundance were related to % forest cover in the 1-km stream reach, but only in streams that had <15% catchment urban land cover. In these cases, catchment urbanization overwhelmed the potential mitigating effects of riparian forests on stream fishes. Together, these results suggest that catchment land cover is an important driver of fish assemblages in urbanizing catchments, and riparian forests are important but not sufficient for protecting stream ecosystems from the impacts of high levels of urbanization.

AB  - Les ripisylves participent à la régulation des flux de nitrates dans les hydrosystèmes car, traversées par d'importantes masses d'eau, elles puisent et stockent efficacement l'azote. Dans la zone alluviale garonnaise, une jeune ripisylve peut prélever en moyenne 0,38g d'azote /j/m2 soit 38 fois plus qu'une prairie pâturée, 25 fois plus qu'une jeune peupleraie et 1,5 à 2 fois plus que des peupleraies mâtures. Sur un tronçon de Garonne de 120 km, nous estimons que la réhabilitation d'une ripisylve arborée de 50 m de largeur permettrait de réduire de 5,6 tonnes par jour, durant la période de végétation, l'apport en azote des nappes alluviales au fleuve. A l'échelle d'un bassin versant, il est plus judicieux de réduire les concentrations d'azote dès l'origine, que d'avoir à les résorber dans la plaine d'inondation. Aussi, il convient de promouvoir la réhabilitation et/ou le développement de formations végétales le long des versants et à l'amont des réseaux hydrographiques, si l'on veut lutter efficacement contre les pollutions azotées diffuses.

AB  - Although thinning of young, even-aged forests may accelerate the development of characteristics associated with mature forests, in the short term it may negatively affect some taxa, including terrestrial salamanders. Preexisting site conditions, including down wood, and forest management measures, such as riparian buffers, may moderate these effects, but these relationships are poorly understood. To explore whether down wood and riparian buffer widths might influence short-term responses to thinning, we sampled salamanders using ground searches before and during the first 2 years after experimental thinning at two 45- to 65-year-old headwater forest sites in western Oregon that differed in down wood volume. Prethinning distributions of terrestrial salamanders overlapped one- and two-tree height riparian buffers, and except for red-backed salamanders, overlapped very little with narrower streamside or variable-width buffers. At the site where down wood volume was low, captures of ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii Gray) and western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum Cooper) both declined by 40% in thinned areas. In contrast, captures of ensatina and Oregon slender salamanders (Batrachoseps wrighti Bishop) were not significantly affected by thinning at the site where down wood volume was high. Our results suggest that site conditions, such as down wood volume, and riparian buffers may influence the effect of thinning on terrestrial salamanders, and demonstrate the tight linkage among management of aquatic, riparian, and upslope resources in headwater forests.

AB  - The composition and structure of riparian forests in the coast redwood region were analyzed in relation to the length of time since timber harvest, and the width of riparian buffer zone. Ten sites were sampled in the central range of the coast redwood forest type within a variety of post-harvest age groups and riparian buffer zone widths. Data was collected using randomly selected sample plots adjacent to perennial coastal steams. Correlation Fisher's r to z tests and two-tailed t-test were used to examine the relationship between the sample variables and the experimental parameters “years since harvest”, and “width of buffer.” Results indicate that canopy cover was negatively correlated to “years since harvest” with the highest level of canopy cover found on the youngest sites and the lowest level found on the old-growth sites. The hardwood to conifer dominance ratio and the basal area of Alnus rubra (red alder) were correlated negatively to both “years since harvest” and “buffer width” indicating that timber harvest favored hardwood species. Late seral associates such as Oxalis oregana (redwood sorrel), Anthyrium filix-femina (lady fern), and Vaccinium parviflorum (billberry) were found preferentially in older forests and sites with wider buffer zones, while non-native species such as Hedera helix (English ivy), Pampas cortedaria (pampas grass), and Myosotis latifolia (forget-me-not) were found preferentially in younger forests and areas with smaller buffer zones.

AB  - Many producers who have used conventional production methods for vegetables, and who want to convert to organic production, will have to pass through a 3-year transition period before their land can be qualified for organic certification. This transition can produce unique challenges. Use of several amendments has received interest for inclusion in organic production. How these affect vegetable production during the transition period was examined. Land was taken from perennial pasture and converted to production of the vegetables: bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), cv. Jupiter; processing cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), cv. Earli Pik; and sweet corn (Zea mays L.), cv. Incredible (se endosperm genotype) using organic materials and methods with comparison made to production using conventional methods. Conventional and transition to organic portions of the field were separated by 25 m with the buffer zone planted with the same sweet corn cultivar used in the experimental plots and minimally maintained by addition of organic fertilizer. To the organic portion of the field, three levels of humates (0, 112, and 224 kg.ha(-1)) and three levels of corn gluten meal (0, 448, and 896 kg.ha(-1)) were applied in nine combinations. Yields for all crops were determined for all years. In the first year, bell pepper yields for plants under conventional production were higher than for the plants in the transition plots. In the remaining 2 years, bell pepper yields were similar under the two production systems. In the first 2 years, cucumber yields for plants under conventional production were higher than for the plants under transition to organic production. In the last year, cucumber yields were similar under the two production systems. In all years, sweet corn yields for plants under conventional production were higher than for plants under transition to organic production. Humates and corn gluten meal did not benefit yields of crops. An economic analysis comparing yields, prices, and costs of production of the crops under conventional and the transition to organic indicated that conventional practices generally provided more net revenue than did transition to organic production. Net revenue for the three species under the transition to organic for the 3 years was $2749 for three hectares. Net revenue for the three crops under conventional production for 3 years was $61,821, a difference of $59,072. Costs, yield, and prices will have to be considered when decisions are made concerning the adoption of organic practices.

AB  - The cost of transporting manure can affect profit. Manure was applied either annually or biennially to bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), cv. Jupiter, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), cv. Earli Pik, and sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa Bonaf.), cv. Incredible (se endosperm genotype), produced using organic methods and compared with production of these crops using conventional methods and annually applied synthetic fertilizer. Conventional and organically maintained portions of the field were separated by a 25-m buffer zone planted with sweet corn, which was provided with manure. The experiment was conducted from 2005 to 2008 at Lane, OK. Nutrient contents of soil and edible portions were determined as were yields. Economic analyses comparing costs of production and profit were conducted. There were yield responses resulting from year. Bell pepper yield was little affected by type of fertilizer application. Cucumber and sweet corn benefited from use of manure over conventional fertilizer. There was no pattern of alternating increased or decreased nutrient content in edible portions or in the soil as a result of annual or biennial application of manure. Treatment with manure produced higher returns than did conventional fertilizer. Annual treatment with manure produced higher returns in bell pepper and sweet corn than did treatment with manure in alternate years; the opposite was true for cucumber. Annual application of manure appears to be necessary for most of the vegetable crops tested.

AB  - Management of headwater streams and their riparian zones has included the implementation of forested riparian buffers, which are intended to protect ecological processes (such as microclimate) and biota, but the appropriate widths for these buffers have been widely debated. We measured the magnitude and extent of microclimatic gradients associated with headwater streams in mature unmanaged forests, and determined whether these patterns were maintained in clearcut harvested units with and without a 30 m-wide riparian buffer on each side of the stream. We measured air temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity between 1 and 70 m from the stream in five replicate blocks of three treatments each in western Oregon. Results indicated the strongest stream effect on air temperature and relative humidity to be within 10 m of the stream in all management treatments at 3:00 pm, and gradients were evident to 20 m in the forested treatment. The clearcut was significantly hotter (air and soil) and drier than either the riparian buffer or the forest treatments at 3:00 pm. The riparian buffer and forest had similar microclimates at all distances from the stream, suggesting that the 30-m buffer adequately protected the riparian microclimatic gradient. We hypothesize that the strong stream effect on microclimate in the riparian zone serves a critical role in mitigating the influence of microclimatic "edge effects" associated with the forest-clearcut edge. Biota dependent on cool, humid microclimates provided by riparian zones will benefit from the implementation of riparian buffers in harvest units.

AB  - Pesticide trapping efficiency of vegetated filter strips (VFS) is commonly predicted with low success using empirical equations based solely on physical characteristics such as width and slope. The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate an empirical model with a foundation of VFS hydrological, sedimentological, and chemical specific parameters. The literature was reviewed to pool data from five studies with hypothesized significant parameters: pesticide and soil properties, percent reduction in runoff volume (i.e., infiltration) and sedimentation, and filter strip width. The empirical model was constructed using a phase distribution parameter, defined as the ratio of pesticide mass in dissolved form to pesticide mass sorbed to sediment, along with the percent infiltration, percent sedimentation, and the percent clay content (R2 = 0.86 and standard deviation of differences [STDD] of 7.8%). Filter strip width was not a statistically significant parameter in the empirical model. For low to moderately sorbing pesticides, the phase distribution factor became statistically insignificant; for highly sorbing pesticides, the phase distribution factor became the most statistically significant parameter. For independent model evaluation datasets, the empirical model based on infiltration and sediment reduction, the phase distribution factor, and the percent clay content (STDD of 14.5%) outperformed existing filter strip width equations (STDD of 38.7%). This research proposed a procedure linking a VFS hydrologic simulation model with the proposed empirical trapping efficiency equation. For datasets with sufficient information for the VFS modeling, the linked numerical and empirical models significantly (R2 = 0.74) improved predictions of pesticide trapping over empirical equations based solely on physical VFS characteristics.

AB  - Preliminary Study on Environmental Quality for Kung Krabaen Bay Project carried out by Office of Environmental Policy and Planning, Department of Pollution Control and Environmental Quality Promotion during 1991-1992 aimed at environmental management. Water, sediments and soils were analysed for coliform bacteria, heavy metals and nutrient elements. The results indicated that the water quality in the bay was, so far still good and did not show any adverse effect on environment. Nutrients, NH4-N, in particular found in the soil where was occupied by the paddy field showed that it was resulted from the fertilizer application. Considerable amount of nutrients which will be transported and deposited along the coastlines through the effluent can be decreased by preserving the buffer zone between coastal area and point sources including shrimp farms, paddy fields, urban and other sources. Long term management, however, depends upon the sound management plan emphasizing landuse, mangroves protection and soils and water conservation. The study recommended that the establishment of wastewater treatment system to protect against the untreated effluent discharged from shrimp farms and households onto the Kung Krabaen Bay, the semiclosed system, be prioritized in order that the eutrophication problem can be controlled. Guidelines for protecting the Kung Krabaen ecosystem are also recommended.

AB  - The study is to determine the effects of logging road construction and timber harvesting on stream water quality in the logging area in Deramakot Forest Reserve. This study was conducted in compartment 51 as control watershed and compartment 63 and 68 as disturbed watersheds. Parameters used for determining water quality are temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, colour and suspended solid. Measurements of stream water quality parameters were carried out in three stages.Stage one when the watersheds i.e. compartments 63 and 68 were still undisturbed and stage two immediately after the roads had been constructed and during active logging activities and stage three after the logging activities had stopped. After the roads had been constructed and harvesting activities commenced in compartments 63 and 68, an increase in the average values of water turbidity of approximately 374.5%, 162.9%, colour 107.2%, 104.7%, pH 5.75%, 7.99%, electrical conductivity 13.74%, 24.68% and suspended solid 128.4%, 159.78% had been observed.  The average values of water temperature and dissolved oxygen did not show any significant difference compared to the average value of the control watershed. Though both sides of streams in compartments 63 and 68 were protected by buffer zone of width 5 meters and 30 meters respectively, it was not able to completely control the movement of the soil sediments into the stream water. But four month after the logging operation had stopped, the mean value of suspended soil, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity and colour rate have reverted back to normal condition. This was attributed to rapid spread or ground vegetation which cover up the exposed ground surfaces thereby protecting the soil physically from erosion.

AB  - Operational procedures for a new inhibitor-based suppression tactic for southern pine beetle (SPB) (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimm.) are nearly ready. A critical component for the acceptance and successful use of this tactic by foresters is a carefully designed technology transfer program. To achieve this goal we developed a questionnaire and sent it to foresters in the southern United States. The questionnaire was designed to develop a profile of foresters based on their experience with SPB, their goals for managing the pest, their knowledge of the insect's biology and control options, their interest in learning a new tactic, and the methods by which they prefer to be trained in the use of the tactic. Of the 3,426 questionnaires sent to foresters in 10 states, 1,028 were returned, 995 (29%) of which were used. Experience with SPB differed among states and appeared related to the frequency of SPB outbreaks. However, experience did not affect the level of knowledge foresters had of SPB biology and control. Among responding foresters, 73% correctly related crown color to brood development in trees, 91% knew that SPB uses semiochemicals as cues for aggregating on hosts, 97% and 79% knew that stands with high basal area and older trees, respectively, are more susceptible to SPB than stands with lower basal area and younger trees. Ninety percent picked a buffer strip width that is roughly equivalent to the width presently recommended for use in direct suppression tactics, less success was reported for differeniating between Ips and SPB infestations. Methods used for evaluating infestations favored revisiting sites and counting the number of green infested trees. Few foresters examined brood galleries, a method we believe is best. Although foresters tend to prefer 100% suppression after one treatment as a minimum acceptable level, most were willing to accept a lower level suppression effectiveness. Most respondents (92%) said they would like to learn about the inhibitor-base

AB  - Fumigants are used to control soilborne pests before planting high-value crops such as strawberry. The use of specialized tarps during fumigation can reduce fumigant emissions and mitigate the need for large buffer zone requirements mandated by regulators. Increased fumigant retention by use of barrier films during fumigant application may increase fumigant retention and allow use of lower fumigant rates to control soil pests than would be needed with permeable film. The objective of this study was to determine the minimum effective rates of the alternative fumigants, 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) + chloropicrin (Pic), and Pic required under virtually impermeable film (VIF) and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tarp to provide weed control equivalent to methyl bromide:chloropicrin (67/33% v/v MBPic) standard soil fumigation at 392 kg·ha–1 under HDPE. A second objective was to determine fumigant rates under VIF and HDPE tarps needed to provide weed control and the economic costs of using VIF and reduced rates of the alternative fumigants. In 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 growing seasons, the fumigants 1,3-D + Pic and Pic were tested at 0, 56, 112, 224, 336, and 448 kg·ha–1 under HDPE and VIF tarps at Oxnard and Watsonville, CA. An untreated control and a MBPic standard at 392 kg·ha–1 were also included in the study. Weed control was assessed using weed propagule viability bioassays for four common weeds, time required for hand weeding, and weed fresh biomass. The fumigant rate that would be needed for a 90% reduction in viability (GR90) for all weeds was 21% to 84% less for 1,3-D + Pic under VIF compared with the HDPE tarp. For Pic, the GR90 values were 5% to 64% less under VIF compared with the HDPE tarp. Hand weeding times and weed biomass decreased with increasing fumigant rates. With the exception of Pic in 2002–2003 at Oxnard, VIF reduced the rate required for weed control compared with the HDPE tarp for both fumigants and at both locations. Economic benefits of VIF relative to the HDPE tarp were not consistent and additional work is needed to quantify these relationships and the production conditions under which VIF will be beneficial.

AB  - Tropical deforestation and habitat fragmentation in areas around conservation areas have been an important element for discussion in the conservation and policy-making community. In this paper, we evaluate land cover change processes around one of the most important tropical dry forest reserves in the Americas: the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The analysis is conducted at three scales: regional scale (coast of the State of Jalisco), proximity to the reserve (via a 30-km buffer zone analysis), and inside the Biosphere Reserve. The proximity analysis is complemented by a unique data set that represents the extent and boundaries of Ejidos (local land management units) in the region. Results indicate that areas surrounding the reserve have low deforestation, with Ejidos and buffer areas having more forest cover as they get closer to the reserve. The nature of this important phenomenon is discussed in the context of the socio-economic conditions of the local communities. Our work suggests that the creation of a network of “Ejidos' Conservation Areas”, in the context of an approach that will recognize payments for environmental services provided to local communities, could contribute to the conservation and maintenance of the rich biodiversity in a region that has one of the highest levels of endemism in the world.

AB  - Although tropical forest conservation is a top priority for human and environmental health, deforestation persists, mainly because of food and economic needs. No community will totally give up economic activities for the sake of ecological integrity, unless it is given alternative economic activities from which to draw its livelihood. Beekeeping in the forest buffer zone instead of traditional destructive honey-harvesting from forest trees is one such option at Arabuko Sokoke Forest (ASF) in Kenya. ASF is a dry coastal forest which is home to endangered and threatened fauna and is a hotspot considered a priority for conservation. In order to find out whether honey quantity and quality differed with distance from the forest, we studied honey yield per harvest (kg) and obtained samples from hives placed at varying distances from ASF in two successive years. Honey yield increased with proximity to the forest. Indeed the yield almost doubled in hives placed less than 1km from the forest compared to those placed more than 3km from the forest. All the honey samples met internationally required quality standards, although sugar levels were at the lower limit. This study demonstrates that the conservation of tropical forest ecosystems can have real local economic benefits. The documentation of the services provided by nearby natural areas should help make conservation of these areas a priority, even for the local communities.

AB  - The edge effect on DBH (diameter at breast height) in two adjacent Pinus radiata D. Don stands was modeled as a function of both the distance from the stand edge and Hegyi's competition index. The modeling was applied to edges with external-competition pressure and on free edges. In both edge types, the incorporation of the Hegyi's competition index in the modeling significantly reduced the residual variation. This modeling showed that the intensity of the intraspecific competition varies between stands. Particularly, the trees in younger stands are more sensitive to the effects of competition than in older stands. However, the intensity of the competition does not vary between edge aspects of stands. The results of the study related to the depth of edge effect can be useful for stratifying stands when getting more precise estimates of trees and stand parameters from sampling are required, and for defining the width of the buffer strip in experimental units used for long-term field assays.

AB  - La réserve naturelle de U Minh Thu+o+.ng a été créée dans les années 1990, ceinturée par une zone tampon où ont été installés 3 500 ménages entre 1992 et 1995. Chaque ménage a reçu un lot de 4 hectares. Sur le plan social, les colons ont été sélectionnés parmi les « pauvres » ou les anciens combattants. Une différenciation sociale s’est progressivement instaurée en faveur de ces derniers. Malgré une homogénéité apparente, le milieu physique montre de légères variations, qui ont des répercussions considérables sur le potentiel des lots. De 1992 à 1998, le gouvernement provincial a appliqué différentes politiques d’aménagement de façon uniforme, bien que cette « nouvelle donne » répétée de la variabilité entre les ménages et les terrains ait des effets mitigés, pouvant aller d’un échec total à un réel soutien aux familles. Enfin, le soutien d’ONG environnementalistes internationales a conforté une orientation pro-nature intransigeante qui a affecté les moyens de subsistance des agriculteurs. Cette expérience sociale « en vraie grandeur » renforce donc la nécessité d’intégrer au minimum les besoins et les contraintes à moindre échelle, en particulier sur un périmètre aussi large.

AB  - Invasive species must cope with a suite of environmental conditions that are different from those in their native ranges. We examine how the physicochemical environment contributes to the invasion success of Orconectes palmeri, a non-native crayfish, in the lower Flint River basin, Georgia, USA. We examined the distribution of Procambarus spiculifer, a native crayfish, and O. palmeri within the lower Flint River basin, and examined associations between species relative abundance and physicochemical variables. Within the lower Flint River, O. palmeri was found almost exclusively at upstream sites, while P. spiculifer was more abundant downstream. We did not detect small O. palmeri downstream, suggesting little recruitment in this area. Within tributaries, only native crayfish were observed. O. palmeri was more abundant at sites with warmer water temperatures, and P. spiculifer was more abundant at sites with cooler water temperatures, which were maintained by ground water seepage. P. spiculifer abundance was also positively associated with abundance of coarse wood. Laboratory studies demonstrated that O. palmeri selected warmer temperatures than P. spiculifer, suggesting that warmer temperatures in the upstream area favor O. palmeri. Water temperatures may have increased in recent years due to human withdrawals from the aquifer and the installation of upstream dams, creating a thermal regime that P. spiculifer has not historically encountered. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of groundwater inputs and a forested riparian buffer is crucial to protect populations of P. spiculifer and to prevent further spread by O. palmeri, especially if climatic changes result in warmer waters.

AB  - A risk assessment of pesticide spray drift damage for the major crops in Flanders, Belgium, was set up. The assessment was done according to the principles of Directive 91/414/EC. In the directive, 10 modules reflect the risk for persons arising from occupational, non-dietary exposure and the risk to the environment. For each module the risk is expressed as a risk index, which is the quotient of the estimated human exposure or predicted environmental concentration to a toxicological reference. The Ganzelmeier curves and the IMAG drift calculator were used to predict drift values. Knowing the applied dose of pesticide and the percentage of drift, the predicted environmental concentrations and the human exposures were calculated. The corresponding risks were estimated for the major growths for three of the ten modules: aquatic organisms, human bystanders and earthworms. Coherent with these calculations, the reducing effects of buffer zones were considered. The assessed buffer zone lengths were compared to the buffer zones, legislated by the Belgian government.

AB  - A vegetative filter strip was installed to treat barnyard runoff from an active dairy farm in Vermont. Runoff from a concrete surfaced barnyard flowed through a detention pond, then onto a vegetative filter strip measuring 22.9 m by 7.6 m with a 2% slope. The water input and surface and subsurface outputs for the strip were continuously monitored from December 1984 through May 1986. Of the total barnyard runoff entering the strip, 65% left as surface runoff and 27% was measured as subsurface outflow. The average hydraulic loading rate was 14.7 cm wk-1 and the average overland flow detention time was 15 min. The filter strip did not significantly (P < 0.05) reduce solids, P, N and bacteria concentrations in the surface output. Over the period of study the mass retention was 33% total suspended solids, 12% total P and 18% total Kjeldahl N. Mass retention was highest during the growing season and was poorest during snowmelt periods. It was concluded that poor filter strip performance was due to an excessive hydraulic loading rate resulting in an inadequate detention time for proper treatment. A preferential flow path from the level lip spreader to the subsurface drain tiles may have contributed to the poor subsurface treatment performance.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to contribute to the implementation of lessimpacting farming practices in environmentally sensitive areas. Vila Velha State Park is located in Campos Gerais, a region of high-technology agriculture. Typical farming systems in the park’s buffer zone were identified in visits, and characterized in consultations with experts, agronomists, retailers and stakeholders. Three major systems (A, B and C) were described, considering the most common practices in crop rotation, choice of products and machineryoperations for soybean and corn production. Systems A and B are characterized by high investment and technology level, though System A has more capital for investment. System C is typified by the use of service packages offered by commissioned retailers. Alternatives tomitigate environmental impact could potentially arise in experiments conducted in association with Farmers A and B, and through economic studies with Farmer C.<br><br>O objetivo deste trabalho é contribuir para a implementação de práticas agrícolas de menor impacto em áreas ambientalmente sensíveis. O Parque Estadual de Vila Velha está localizado nos CamposGerais, Paraná, região de agricultura altamente tecnificada. Os sistemas de produção da área de entorno do Parque foram identificados em visitas e caracterizados em consultas com especialistas, engenheiros agrônomos, representantes comerciais e produtores. Três sistemas de produção de soja e milho (A, B e C), típicos da região, foram descritos, considerando-se as práticas mais comuns em rotação de culturas, escolha de produtos e operações de maquinário. Os sistemas A e B foram caracterizados como de alto nível de investimento e tecnologia, sendo que o primeiro seria mais capitalizado. O sistema C diferencia-se pela utilização de pacotes de serviços oferecidos por revendas comissionadas. Alternativas paradiminuir o impacto ambiental dos manejos observados poderiam potencialmente surgir a partir de experimentos desenvolvidos com os produtores dos sistemas A e B, e estudos econômicos junto aos produtores do sistema C.

AB  - There exists little information on species composition of vegetation in industrial plants in Slovakia. The most detailed survey is by Supuka (1985) who inspected 172 industrial plants. The composition of woody plants consists of forest and fruit trees (52.7%); plantings were carried out non-professionally, without documentation and without evaluating the health of the woody plants in the area. The majority of enterprises lacked a sanitary buffer zone of vegetation, and what vegetation existed was not cared for. The primary reasons for increased woody plants in industrial areas are biological - climatic, sanitary, psychological and psycho-hygienic. The present work discusses woody plant composition in 15 selected industrial plants (mostly in central Slovakia) from the view-point of species composition and quality. All data was tabulated. It is hoped that planting and maintenance of suitable and valuable vegetation should by law be part of any investment activity in future

AB  - Filter strips are widely prescribed to reduce contaminants in surface runoff from agricultural fields. This study compared performance of different filter strip designs on several contaminants and evaluated the contributing processes. Different vegetation types and widths were investigated using simulated runoff event on large plots (3 m x 7.5 or 15 m) having fine-textured soil and a 6 to 7% slope. Filler strips 7.5 and 15 m wide downslope greatly reduced concentrations of sediment in runoff (76-93%) and contaminants strongly associated with sediment (total P, 55-79%; permethrin, 27-83% [(3-phenoxyphenyl) methyl (+/-)-cis, trans-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate]). They had less effect on concentrations of primarily dissolved contaminants [atrazine, -5-43% (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine); alachlor, 10-61 % [2-chloro-2'6'-diethyl- N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide]; nitrate, 24-48;. dissolved P, 19-43%; bromide, 13-31%]. Dilution of runoff by rainfall accounted for most of the reduction of concentration of dissolved contaminants. Infiltration (36-82% of runoff volume) substantially reduced the mass of contaminants exiting the filter strips. Doubling filter strip width from 7.5 to 15 m doubled infiltration and dilution, but did not improve sediment settling. Young trees and shrubs planted in the lower one-half of otherwise grass strips had no impact on filter performance. Compared with cultivated sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] grass clearly reduced concentrations of sediment and associated contaminants in runoff, but not volume of runoff and concentration of dissolved contaminants. Settling, infiltration, and dilution processes canexplain performance differences among pollutant types and filter strip designs.

AB  - Across the U.S., multiple species of riparian vegetation have proven to be effective filters of sediment and nutrients in agricultural watersheds. Research at Southern Illinois University Carbondale has focused on giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.] as a potential candidate to incorporate into riparian buffer designs. In 2001, an exploratory study (i.e., Phase I) monitored nutrient and sediment concentrations from surface runoff and groundwater in the Cypress Creek watershed, while two subsequent studies (i.e., Phase II) focused on groundwater quality and added additional riparian buffer plots in the Big Creek and Cache River Watersheds. The primary objective of this research was to compare nutrient attenuation in groundwater of native giant cane and forest riparian buffers. Results from phase I showed significant nutrient reductions in groundwater over short distances in both the giant cane (~3.0 m) and forest buffers (~6.0 m), thus additional wells were installed at 1.5 and 12.0 m for the second phase. Groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N was significantly reduced by 90% in the initial 3.0 m of the giant cane buffer, where plant assimilation and microbial denitrification were likely key NO₃ ⁻-N removal mechanisms. Phase II showed significant reductions in groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N beneath the forest buffers, whereas little change occurred below the giant cane buffers. However, NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations beneath giant cane buffers were 3 times less than those observed beneath the forest buffers. Follow-up studies are being conducted on the transport of E. coli through vegetated buffers, and efforts have been expanded to the watershed-scale.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was established by the Food Security Act of 1985. Since its inception, thousands of acres of cropland in stream riparian zones have been converted to conservation buffers through the planting of trees and native grasses. The objectives of this study were to determine the phosphorus (P)-sorption characteristics of the surface soil in a 13-year-old CRP buffer and an adjacent continuously cropped production area from which the buffer was created and to assess differences in P-sorption maxima and P-buffering capacity between the sites. Phosphorus sorption was modeled with both the simple Langmuir and the two-surface Langmuir equations. There were significant differences in all P-sorption parameters between the cropped area and the buffer over most of the depth increments studied. The cropped area soil had higher sorption max (Smax), binding energy (k), and P equilibrium buffering capacity (PEBC) than the buffer soil. However, the buffer had higher equilibrium P concentration (EPC). These findings imply that it may not be appropriate to assume that a buffer will act as a P sink simply because it is not receiving P fertilization. Any assessment of buffer or filter strip effectiveness for P retention should include an examination of the P-sorption properties of the soils present.

AB  - Spatial and temporal changes in ground beetle populations of a northern German farm during the conversion from conventional to organic methods were studied between 2001 and 2007. The conversion of the total arable area was partially performed beginning in autumn 2001 and completed in spring 2004. During the conventional period, species richness and diversity of ground beetles were negatively correlated with distance from field margin toward field centre, reaching a minimum at 60–240m. Species diversity increased to match levels found in set-aside areas outside of arable fields 4 years after conversion. Species richness, however, remained poor at the centres of arable fields. Pterostichus melanarius was the most abundant species, averaging more than 50% dominance. At the beginning of organic farming in 2002, the abundance of nine species typical for arable fields and grassland increased, whereas the dominance of P. melanarius decreased. Species affected positively by organic farming were found in the conventional period outside the arable fields in high numbers.

AB  - Apex carnivores around the world have experienced rapid population declines and local extirpation due to anthropogenic pressures, and they are increasingly restricted to government-protected areas (GPAs). Though GPAs are critical for carnivore conservation, mixed-use landscapes may be crucial for sustaining viable populations. Few studies, particularly in Africa, have examined joint use of a landscape by people and conflict-prone carnivores, such as the African lion (Panthera leo), in a situation where conflict is low. In southern Kenya, we studied a lion population in an unfenced rangeland occupied by the Maasai people and their livestock. The Maasai shift their settlements and grazing areas seasonally across a permanent river, a practice we hypothesized might promote coexistence. We radio-collared lions (n=6) to determine density and document spatial patterns in response to seasonal movements of people in a Conservation Area and buffer zone (250km²). Despite high livestock density, lion density was comparable to many GPAs (0.136individuals/km²). Lion spatial distribution and habitat selection shifted in relation to seasonal movements of people and livestock. Conflict was low, likely because lions increased their use of the Conservation Area and dense habitats when people were nearby. Lion responses to human movements reduced access to permanent water, but not prey. A land use system based on temporary settlements and grazing areas allowed lions to co-occur with people and livestock at high density. These results suggest a general strategy for the conservation of apex carnivores outside of GPAs, focusing on areas that exhibit spatiotemporal variation in human land use.

AB  - Extensive new trackline coverage of the Chile Trench between23°S and 34°S, including more than 60 bathymetric and seismic reflectionprofiles across the trench axis, allows a much more detailedstudy of the tectonics and sedimentation of this feature than previouslypossible. Sediment distribution along the axis shows a remarkablevariation from over a kilometer of turbidites in the axis south of 33°Sto a barren axis in places north of 27°S. Turbidity currents originatingon the outer continental margin in the south carry sediment northwardalong the axis. Ponding behind structural barriers created byplate convergence restricts the amount of sediment reaching northerntrench sections.Horst and graben blocks are the dominant structural featureson the seaward trench slope, with fault offsets of 500 to 1000 meters.Grabens range in width from 4 to 8 km, while the faulting probablyextends down into oceanic layer three. Faulting is most pronouncedin the deeper northern parts of the trench, but can also be seen inthe basement beneath undeformed axial sediments in the south. Thiscrustal rupture can be related to extensional stress in the upperoceanic crust due to the downbending of the Nazca Plate prior to subduction.Most of the active normal faulting occurs soon after theplate begins its descent into the trench, and not within the trenchaxis.Using structure, sediment distribution, bathymetry, andmorphology, the trench and outer continental margin can be dividedinto three provinces (Northern, 23°-27°S; Central 27°-33°S; andSouthern, 33°-34°S) separated by distinct tectonic transition zonesat 27°S and 33°S. These boundaries coincide with breaks in onshoregeologic trends and correlate less well with seismic zone segmentation.An analysis of potential strain due to subduction along a non-arcuatetrench concludes that segmentation in the trench is probablycontrolled more by continental block structure than by the linearityof the trench.A narrow, continuous pond of sediment partially fills theCentral Province trench axis between 32°30'S and 27°S. Trenchaxis morphology and piston core samples indicate there is transportof terrigenous sediment down the axis from the abundant sedimentsupply regions of the Southern Province. A model is formulated fromthis data which accounts for the sediment wedge in the Central Provinceby supply of turbidites from the south. A steady-state of axialfill can be maintained by one typical flow every 14 to 27 years.Uplifted axial turbidites are present on the seaward trenchslope at 30°35'S, elevated 350 meters above the axis. Radiocarbondating puts the age of initial uplift at 5380 ± 350 years B.P., whichresults in a minimum vertical movement rate of 6.5 cm/yr. Reversedfaulting due to compressive stresses generated by plateconvergence is the presumed mechanism of uplift.A model is proposed to explain the differences in the Chileancontinental margin morphology in each of the three provinces. Theradical differences in the amount of sediment available to the trenchaxis appears to be a prime influence in the development of the margin.An abundance of axial sediments provides a buffer zone alongthe major interplate contact (slip) zone, plus material to be accretedinto the lower continental slope. If the amount of axial sediments islimited, excessive frictional resistance to slippage between theconverging plates may tectonically erode the margin by slowly wearingaway the underside of the continental slope.

AB  - A naturally functioning riparian zone is essential for the ecological health of a river, filtering pollutants, supplying organic matter and providing a structural habitat for wildlife. Most lowland rivers would also naturally flood the riparian zone at regular intervals, thereby providing direct inputs of nutrients and water that create additional habitats and breeding opportunities for riverine species. We examined the relationship between the quality of the riparian habitat and foraging and activity of bats (Chiroptera), which are good indicators of ecosystem health. Twenty paired sites in the Rivers Lee and Colne catchments in England were selected to test the hypothesis that degradation in the quality of riparian habitat reduces foraging and activity in bats; paired sites were similar in terms of size, flow rate and water chemistry but differed in the quality of their riparian zones. AnaBat detectors were used to measure bat activity from 30 min before dusk to 30 min after sunrise on the same night at paired sites because recording frequency-divided bat echolocation calls in real time allows large amounts of data to be collected over long time periods in a digitized format. Significantly more feeding buzzes were recorded in sites with better quality riparian zones; no differences in overall bat activity were found between the two habitat types. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus accounted for 96% of bat passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus was significantly more active in high quality sites than P. pipistrellus; there was no difference between the two species in poor quality sites. We show that the quality of riparian buffer zones is important for the activity and feeding behaviour of pipistrelle bats.

AB  - Recent rises in levels of tropical deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon, along with the country's interest in pursuing a reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) agenda, raise important questions regarding levels of forest governance and institutional capacity in the region. This research adopts a political ecology approach to examine forest governance in Peru's Central Selva region. Semi-structured key informant interviews were carried out in Lima, Oxapampa, and communities across the western buffer zone of the Yanachaga-Chemillen National Park. The region's history highlights the nature of the exploitative activities which lead to the present institutional and floristic conditions, while a geopolitical dichotomy has played an important role in preventing the formation of a common vision for regional development. The state authorities are found to be critically under-capacitated for their remit, while NGO efforts in the area appear disperse and uncoordinated. National market forces, along with national Amazonian settlement policy, are found to have the greatest influence on land use. The relative lack of state presence, inappropriate institutions, and extractive economy suggest that the region is currently institutionally unequipped to undertake and govern a REDD initiative. Through studies like the one presented here it is possible to gain a thorough understanding of local governance workings to ground and contextualize REDD in local realities.

AB  - Polypropylene baling twine used by Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) during nest construction creates a risk of entanglement for nestlings and adults on the yellowstone River, Montana. In 2013, we evaluated the abundance of twine in 2-km-radius buffer zones centred on 38 nests for three categories of road density. We found more twine per kilometre along roads in low (n = 19) and moderate (n = 13) road density nest buffer zones than in high road density nest buffer zones (n = 6). The estimated total amount of twine found along roads in nest buffer zones ranged from 0 to 2602 m and did not differ among road density strata. The percentage of Osprey nests containing twine was highest in low (63.2%) and moderate (61.5%) road density nest buffer zones and lowest (33.3%) in high road density buffer zones, which reflected a gradient from rural and suburban to urban landscapes. The estimated total amount of twine within a nest buffer zone did not predict whether a nest contained twine. The amount of twine found in seven nests destroyed by wind or power company personnel ranged from 0 to 206 m and was not correlated with the amount of twine found in their buffer zones. During the 2012 and 2013 breeding seasons, four of 120 nestlings (3.3%) became entangled in twine: two were cut free and fledged normally, one died, and one was euthanized. The abundance of twine in the environment surrounding nests and its slow rate of biodegradation mean that vigilance by citizen scientist nest monitors and assistance from power companies are the only short-term solution to reducing mortality resulting from entanglement.

AB  - The high cost of traditional satellite aerial imagery has made it almost impossible for low budget projects to access up to date spatial data. As a result planning has often been based on out of date topographic and thematic maps when the reality is far different. This guide provides a method, using a balloon and a digital camera,that allows lower level planners to generate real time topographical snapshots at low cost. The overall aim is to incorporate and geo-reference unrestricted data from balloon aerial photography into a coordinate system topographical map. <br /><br />Target areas include provincial through community level planning, development projects, the private sector, natural resource management, buffer zone management, rural development and urban land validation.<br /><br />Step by step instructions are given outlining, the assembly of the balloon device including the production of hydrogen gas, mapping techniques, geo-referencing and field data acquisition.

AB  - Runoff and sediment generated within drainage area of a stream (hillslope catchment) enter the stream through well-defined flow-paths. Vegetated Filter Strip (VFS), when constructed downstream of the flow-paths, within the buffer zone of the stream, can effectively trap sediments and pollutants carried by runoff. The amount of sediments and nutrients entering the stream varies along the stream. Therefore the maximum effectiveness of the VFS in watershed context could be achieved by proper selection of the location and size of the VFS along the stream as the performance of the VFS is strongly affected by the amount of runoff and sediment entering the VFS. This study focused on the development of a watershed-based approach to evaluate the performance of vegetative filter strip by integration of a vegetative filter strip model (VFSMOD) with a watershed-scale hydrology and sediment transport model (AGNPS). The methodology developed consists of extracting geometrical and land surface environment information from GIS-based data to generate input data for AGNPS model, estimation of the amount of sediment, and runoff for each flow-path within the hillslope catchment using AGNPS model, and the use of AGNPS outputs to generate input data for the VFSMOD model, to examine the effectiveness of VFS in reducing the sediment entering the stream network. The developed methodology was applied to a sample watershed in Ontario and the amount of runoff, peak flow and sediment load, with and without VFS, were compared for different scenarios.

AB  - Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma (FD) was found in Slovenia (Ankaran, South-west Slovenia) for the first time in 2005. In 2006, two further foci of FD were discovered inside the five-kilometre buffer zone of the first focus. Until now infected vine stocks were only found among the vine cultivars 'Pinot gris', 'Chardonnay' and Malvasia. Inside the infected area phytosanitary measures have been carried out. Elimination of symptomatic vine stocks and obligatory treatments with insecticides against the vector Scaphoideus titanus Ball has been approved. Obligatory insecticide treatments are also being required in all vine nurseries and in the vine mother stands, if the presence of the pest has been established. The three years survey of the vector has shown its presence in both continental winegrowing regions as well.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conservation of biological diversity and economical utilization of natural resources form an almost inevitable confrontation between the two. In practice, however, a balance between the two ought to be found, and in managed boreal forests, preservation of woodland key habitats is increasingly used strategy to safeguard biological diversity. According to the Finnish Forests Act, certain Forest Act habitat (FAH) types must be safeguarded, provided they are clearly distinguishable from their surroundings. Furthermore, once the habitat has been identified as a FAH, its special characteristics must not be altered. Both of these aspects contain ambiguities that potentially undermine the practical application of the Act. We designed a replicated sampling study to address these ambiguities at the most common FAH type, riparian habitat of small boreal streams. As response variables we used vascular plants and mosses. We asked i) how wide is the FAH around small streams that is distinguishable from its surrounding and ii) how wide buffer strip around the FAH is sufficient for long term to preserve the natural species community composition of the FAH. RESULTS: We found that an average three meters wide strip around the stream constitutes the distinguishable FAH and that a minimum of 45 meters wide buffers on both sides of the stream are needed for the species community composition to remain unaltered. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 45 meters wide buffers appear sufficient to safeguard vascular plant and moss species communities within the FAH, prevent local populations from extinctions and thus pre-empt extinction debt that would be realised with more narrow buffers. While 45 meters may seem intolerable from the commercial forestry point of view, anything less than that may be intolerable from the point of view of conservation, and thus against the idea of sustainable use of natural resources.

AB  - This study focused on the sediment reduction effects of VFS (vegetative filter strip) systems for the general characteristics of uplands in Korea. General conditions of upland fields were investigated through national scales of annual agricultural statistics. 7-15 % of slope with loam soil was the dominant types of uplands, and the hydrologic soil group feature usually belong to Type B. The common sizes of uplands were bigger than 0.1 ha and less than 0.2 ha, and 86.2 % of them account for less than 1.0 ha. With this information, 0.1 ha, 0.5 ha, and 1.0 ha of uplands with various shapes and 7-15 % of slopes were considered for the VFS system simulations. 20 mm, 40 mm, and 100 mm of daily precipitation were applied. As a result, the trapping efficiencies of VFS systems were obtained 37.4～100 % for 7 % slope and 18.1～98.0 % for 15 % slope of the less than 1.0ha of uplands. As rainfall increased, sediment loads also increased with slope and slope length increase. Also as size and slope of uplands and slope length increased with VFS length decrease, the trapping efficiency decreased for the same amount of rainfall. The optimum lengths of VFS systems for the givien upland conditions were suggested based on the modelling results with condition of VFS length less than 20 % of upland areas.

AB  - Anthropic changes and chemical pollution confront wild plant communities with xenobiotic combinations of bioactive molecules, degradation products, and adjuvants that constitute chemical challenges potentially affecting plant growth and fitness. Such complex challenges involving residual contamination and mixtures of pollutants are difficult to assess. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was confronted by combinations consisting of the herbicide glyphosate, the fungicide tebuconazole, the glyphosate degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and the atrazine degradation product hydroxyatrazine, which had been detected and quantified in soils of field margins in an agriculturally intensive region. Integrative analysis of physiological, metabolic, and gene expression responses was carried out in dose–response experiments and in comparative experiments of varying pesticide combinations. Field margin contamination levels had significant effects on plant growth and metabolism despite low levels of individual components and the presence of pesticide degradation products. Biochemical and molecular analysis demonstrated that these less toxic degradation products, AMPA and hydroxyatrazine, by themselves elicited significant plant responses, thus indicating underlying mechanisms of perception and transduction into metabolic and gene expression changes. These mechanisms may explain observed interactions, whether positive or negative, between the effects of pesticide products (AMPA and hydroxyatrazine) and the effects of bioactive xenobiotics (glyphosate and tebuconazole). Finally, the metabolic and molecular perturbations induced by low levels of xenobiotics and associated degradation products were shown to affect processes (carbon balance, hormone balance, antioxidant defence, and detoxification) that are likely to determine environmental stress sensitivity.

AB  - The relative magnitudes of, and factors controlling, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were measured in the soil of a re-connected temperate floodplain divided into four different land management zones (grazing grassland, hay meadow, fritillary meadow and a buffer zone). Soil samples were collected from each zone to measure their respective potentials for nitrate attenuation using ¹⁵N both at the surface and at depth in the soil column and additional samples were collected to measure the lability of the organic carbon. Denitrification capacity ranged between 0.4 and 4.2 (μmol N g⁻¹ dry soil d⁻¹) across the floodplain topsoil and DNRA capacity was an order of magnitude lower (0.01–0.71 μmol N g⁻¹ d⁻¹). Land management practice had a significant effect on denitrification but no significant effects were apparent for DNRA. In this nitrogen-rich landscape, spatial heterogeneity in denitrification was explained by differences in lability and the magnitude of organic carbon associated with different management practices (mowing and grazing). The lability of organic carbon was significantly higher in grazing grassland in comparison to other ungrazed areas of the floodplain, and consequently denitrification capacity was also highest in this area. Our results indicate that bacteria capable of DNRA do survive in frequently flooded riparian zones, and to a limited extent, compete with denitrification for nitrate, acting to retain and recycle nitrogen in the floodplain. Exponential declines in both denitrification and DNRA capacity with depth in the floodplain soils of a hay meadow and buffer zone were controlled primarily by the organic carbon content of the soils. Furthermore, grazing could be employed in re-connected, temperate floodplains to enhance the potential for nitrate removal from floodwaters via denitrification.

AB  - The distributions of various forest cover types on Changbai Mountain of northeastern China were examined by interpreting Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data. The area studied consists of the Changbai Nature Reserve plus an 8 km wide buffer zone. The dominant forest cover types were mixed Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. & Zucc.) hardwood forest below 1100 m above sea level (asl) and evergreen coniferous forest between 1100 and 1650 m asl. These two forest cover types accounted for about 70% of the area inside the reserve, and 50% of the area outside the reserve. Other forest cover types included aspen (Populus davidiana Dode)-white birch (Betula platyphylla Sukachev) forest, hardwood forest, larch (Larix olgensis A. Henry) forest, sparse forest land, and mountain birch (Betula ermanii Cham.) forest. Above the forest line (1950 m asl), a zone of tundra was distributed on the top of Changbai Mountain. The mountain birch forest was located between tundra and the evergreen forest. Human-altered areas, including forest clearcuts and urban areas, accounted for only 10% of the whole study area. More than 90% (in area) of the human-altered areas was found in the zone surrounding the reserve. To better protect the old-growth forest ecosystems inside and outside Changbai Nature Reserve, conservation planning for the reserve and forest management for the surrounding area need to be modified.

AB  - This study investigates three treatment methods to establish field margins of high botanical and invertebrate diversity within an intensively managed grassland system. Field margin treatments were: fenced only, rotavated and allowed to regenerate naturally, reseeded with a grass and wildflower seed mixture. Control plots were unfenced and grazed. Field margin widths were established at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 m. The botanical composition of the plots was examined on four occasions between 2002 and 2004 using permanent nested quadrats. Emergence traps were installed in each of the treatments to investigate invertebrate abundance response to treatment. Results showed that (1) reseeding had a positive effect on resultant botanical diversity when compared with other establishment treatments investigated, (2) natural regeneration after rotavation could not be recommended as an effective means of restoring diversity under these environmental conditions, due to the abundance of undesirable weed species, (3) exclusion of fertiliser inputs alone resulted in a very slow change in the botanical composition, (4) width of plot did not have a significant influence on plant species richness and (5) treatment and time of sampling had highly significant impacts on overall invertebrate abundance.

AB  - The effectiveness of mature riparian forests in reducing the impact of agriculture on the quality of the nation's water resources has been documented, but the impact of forest management practices implemented within riparian forest buffers on their water quality function has not been evaluated. This article examines the effect of forest management within a Coastal Plain riparian forest buffer system (RFBS) on runoff and sediment transport over a four year period. The RFBS, which conformed to USDA-FS and USDA-NRCS best management recommendations, included a narrow strip of undisturbed forest located adjacent to the stream drainage system (Zone 1), a wide managed pine forest downslope from the grass filter (Zone 2), and a narrow grass filter strip immediately downslope from an agricultural field (Zone 3). Forest management treatments evaluated within Zone 2 were mature forest, clear-cut, and selectively-thinned. Significant reductions in runoff and sediment transport were measured under all three forest management treatments. The primary zone of runoff and sediment reduction was within the grass filter portion of the RFBS. These results indicate that riparian forests within a RFBS may be managed for economic return to the land owner without adversely affecting the runoff and sediment reduction function performed by these buffer systems.

AB  - A low-impact surface flow sampler was developed for riparian studies conducted in the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern United States. The device consists of two primary components, a splitter and a collector, which were used for unattended sampling of surface flow in riparian buffer study areas. This low-cost device provides a composite event sample at selected locations within experimental areas. The quantity of sample is adequate for laboratory analyses of dissolved and suspended constituents for both large and small flow events, and permits estimation of the volume of surface flow at the sampling location. Installation and operation of the device requires little disturbance to the riparian buffer ground surface and vegetation, or to surface flow within experimental areas

AB  - Watershed development often triggers channel incision that leads to radical changes in channel morphology. Although morphologic evolution due to channel incision has been documented and modeled by others, ecological effects, particularly water quality effects, are less well understood. Discharge, basic physical parameters, solids, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll and bacteria were monitored for five years at two sites along a stream in a mixed-cover watershed characterized by rapid incision of the entire channel network. Concurrent data were collected from two sites on a nearby stream draining a watershed of similar size and cultivation intensity, but without widespread incision. Data sets describing physical aquatic habitat and fish fauna of each stream were available from other studies. The second stream was impacted by watershed urbanization, but was not incised, so normal channel-floodplain interaction maintained a buffer zone of floodplain wetlands between the study reach and the urban development upstream. The incised stream had mean channel depth and width that were 1.8 and 3.5 times as large as for the nonincised stream, and was characterized by flashier hydrology. The median rise rate for the incised stream was 6.4 times as great as for the nonincised stream. Correlation analyses showed that hydrologic perturbations were associated with water quality degradation, and the incised stream had levels of turbidity and solids that were two to three times higher than the nonincised, urbanizing stream. Total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl N, and chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in the incised stream, while nitrate was significantly greater in the nonincised, urbanizing stream (p < or = 0.02). Physical aquatic habitat and fish populations in the nonincised urbanizing stream were superior, as it supported almost twice as many species and yielded more than four times as much biomass per unit of effort. These results suggest that channel incision is associated with a complex of ecological stressors that includes channel erosion, hydrologic perturbation, and water quality and physical habitat degradation. Ecological engineering of stream corridors must focus at least as much energy on mediating hydrologic perturbations and managing habitat quality as on pollutant loadings.

AB  - I investigated the role of habitat structure in explaining bird species richness and abundance in riparian buffer strips of old-growth coniferous forest on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Using buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species, and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features. Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose abundance is associated with deciduous trees.

AB  - Some impacts of 28-year-old South Coastal lodgepole pine forest on adjacent open blanket bog were investigated. A general rise in ground level in unplanted areas between 1966 and 1987 had been cancelled out by subsidence over most of the area by 1996. The forest plots had subsided by 40-80 cm since planting, depending on the cultivation/drainage treatment used and had an increased peat dry bulk density (0.13 Mg m-3) and a decreased water content (7 kg kg-1 dry matter) compared with points more than 50 m from the forest (0.06-0.11 Mg m-3 and 9-16 kg kg-1 dry matter). The depth to water table in July averaged 55 cm in the forest but only 20 cm outside. The zone outside the forest affected by subsidence averaged 30 m wide in 1996, compared with 10-20 m in 1987, suggesting that by the end of the first rotation a 40-m wide zone will be affected. The development of a slope outside the forest by subsidence was considered to be a consequence of more rapid run-off and seepage towards the forest, rather than root spread onto the bog. Where pool systems or other vulnerable habitats are surrounded by forest, a buffer zone at least 40 m wide is needed between the edge of the habitat and the edge of the forest to safeguard the habitat during the first rotation. A narrower buffer zone may be sufficient in higher rainfall areas.

AB  - The report looks at some of the factors involved in the joint indigenous forest conservation. The factors explored by the study include present policy and legislation, land tenure, cost and benefits of conservation, institutional considerations, indigenous knowledge, farming systems, marketing of non-timber forest products, gender issues and promotion of out-of-forest activities.     
The potential of GIS in the zoning of forest reserves by creation of a buffer zone where subsistence use by the forest-adjacent communities can take place is assessed. An attempt is made to asses how remote sensing and GIS can contribute to joint forest conservation with the forest-adjacent communities through the integration of socio-economic and biophysical data collected using participatory rural appraisal techniques.

AB  - The dynamics of soil microbial C, N and P in response to NO3- and PO43- addition were investigated and quantified in a constructed wetland buffer zone divided into three experimental areas. The method used was fumigation-extraction method (FEM), which is commonly used to estimate total soil microbial biomass. N immobilisation in the microbial biomass during the first year after N and P additions ranged from 30.6 kg N ha-1 in the upper experimental area (0.2 ha), which received a high N and P addition, to 2.1 kg N ha-1 in the lower experimental area (0.3 ha) which got lower N and P additions, and 0.4 kg N ha-1 in the control area (0.3 ha). P immobilisation ranged from 13.8 kg P ha-1 in the upper experimental area to 2.8 kg P ha-1 in the lower experimental area and -2.3 kg P ha-1 in the control area. The immobilised proportions of N and P in the microbial biomass in the experimental areas were approximately 15% of the added N (90 kg N ha-1) and approximately 25% of the added P (30 kg P ha-1) during the first year after N and P addition in 1999. Microbial biomass is thus an important factor contributing to nutrient immobilisation in a constructed wetland buffer in transient conditions.

AB  - Objective of the study was to determine economic and social factors which related to the home use of forest products, especially timber and firewood, e.g., in the communities adjacent to buffer zone around Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Uthai Thani Province. The problems which arise from wood usage in Huai Kha Khaeng and possible solutions to such problems are also discussed. The sample consisted of 100 households, questionaire were used in data collection, and the SPSS/PC+ statistical package was used in data processing. Percentage, mean, chi-square, and contigency coefficient values were statistical techniques used in data analysis; statistical significance was set at 0.05. The study found that the average timber and charcoal consumption per household per year was 4.19 cubic m and 1.42 cubic m respectively. Trees were either cut down on farm or forest land, or were bought from neighbors who took the trees from forest land. The factors which related to the household consumption were household income and farm size; whereas the household firewood consumption was depend on the number of household members and the types of fuel used. In addition, the significant community problems were analysed, furthermore, the means to be employed for the problems solving are recommended. First, the villagers has no right to occupy their lands, thus, the ones who hold the cleared forest land for a proper long period should be obtained the land certificate. Second, the input for crop production (seeds, fertilizer) are expensive, this will call for the price control and price support programe for agricultural inputs and products respectively. Third, villagers did not understanding on about the objectives of buffer zone project, as well as the demarcation of the buffer zone area, hence, the public relation for this project is needed.

AB  - Four permanent sample plots were established in a logged natural forest in June  1994.  The area is inside a miombo dry  forest in the barue plateaz, Manica province.  The most common species in the region are Brachystegia Boehmii B.spiciformis and Pericopsis angolensis.  The area of study covers aboutr 10 ha and is dominated by Millettia stuhlmannii with other trees like Psedolachnostylis maprouneifolia and Piliostigma thoningii, also present.  The plots measure 100X100m each and have a buffer zone of 80m around them.  During the establishment of the plots, trees (dbh>10cm) were assessed for dbh, crown and stem form.  Species were identified in the field or in the University Herbarium.  A total of 57 tree species were found in the area.  Of these 45 were identified by their scientific names and 20 are commercially valuable.  Many other species are used by the local community for medicine, firewood, building materials and other products.  An aaverageof 185 trees per hectare were found in the area representing a basal area of 12 square meteres/ha.  The commercially valuable species represented an average of 50 trees/ha with a basal area of 4 square meters/ha.  The regeneration of all tree species in the area was analyzed and the findings were that there is a poor regeneration.  Frequent fires occurring in the region would be the main reason for poor regeneration of tree species.  Ecological analysis leads to the conclusion that natural forests of this type need silvicultural intervention to promote regeneration and that dires must be controlled or the value of forest will decline.

AB  - Field margins have been widely advocated as a means of integrating agronomic and biodiversity objectives and are included in agri-environment schemes across Europe. However, information on the long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a long-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed species. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of herbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early conclusions remained valid after 13years. Although early successional trends suggested that naturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, and that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown swards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally regenerated swards. Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost most rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by mowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In sown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards was promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13years, timing and frequency of mowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward composition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of establishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-term conservation value of the swards.

AB  - A primary objective of agri-environment schemes is the conservation of biodiversity; in addition to increasing the value of farmland for wildlife, these schemes also aim to restore natural ecosystem functioning. The management of scheme options can influence their value for delivering ecosystem services by modifying the composition of floral and faunal communities. This study examines the impact of an agri-environment scheme prescription on ecosystem functioning by testing the hypothesis that vegetation management influences decomposition rates in grassy arable field margins. The effects of two vegetation management practices in arable field margins - cutting and soil disturbance (scarification) - on litter decomposition were compared using a litterbag experimental approach in early April 2006. Bags had either small mesh designed to restrict access to soil macrofauna, or large mesh that would allow macrofauna to enter. Bags were positioned on the soil surface or inserted into the soil in cut and scarified margins, retrieved after 44, 103 and 250 days and the amount of litter mass remaining was calculated. Litter loss from the litterbags with large mesh was greater than from the small mesh bags, providing evidence that soil macrofauna accelerate rates of litter decomposition. In the large mesh bags, the proportion of litter remaining in bags above and belowground in the cut plots was similar, while in the scarified plots, there was significantly more litter left in the aboveground bags than in the belowground bags. This loss of balance between decomposition rates above and belowground in scarified margins may have implications for the development and maintenance of grassy arable field margins by influencing nutrient availability for plant communities.

AB  - A field monitoring study of a riparian forest buffer zone was conducted to determine the impact of the riparian ecosystem on reducing the concentration of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and December 1994, and analyzed for NO(3)-N, PO4, and NH(4)-N. Statistical analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields. Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field. Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer season for most sampling locations

AB  - A field monitoring study of a riparian forest buffer zone was conducted to determine the impact of the riparian ecosystem on reducing the concentration of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and December 1994, and analyzed for NO(3)-N, PO4, and NH(4)-N. Statistical analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields. Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field. Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer season for most sampling locations

AB  - Coastal ecosystem of Bangladesh has experienced notable degradation due to shrimp farming during the last two decades. This shrimp farming industry has been heavily criticized because of its devastating ecological and socio-economic impacts and requires major changes in practice to become environmentally sustainable. Therefore, this study proposes an ecohydrology based shrimp farming (ESF) approach to management practice which has the potential to reverse the degradation of coastal ecosystems. To make such as strategy successful, a change in present practice is needed and must be accepted by the farm owner (e.g. national and multinational investors) as well as supported by the policy makers. Shrimp farming will continue to degrade coastal ecosystems as well as the farms themselves unless change is made to current management and practices. So, there is therefore, an urgent need to develop a better understanding of the interaction between biota and water of this coastal ecosystem, which is the core concern of ecohydrology. Then to develop ecohydrology based shrimp farming (ESF) system that includes the introduction of a sequential ponds, buffer zone with halophytes, and constructed wetland. This would enhance the carrying capacity of the shrimp farm and the local coastal ecosystem, thereby increase overall resilience against anthropogenic pressure. This approach could be highly successful and effective by finding out the suitable salt accumulator halophytes, the width of buffer zone, the size of fish-bivalves pond, sediment trap pond and constructed wetland.

AB  - The importance of managing weeds in seminatural habitats that are adjacent to farm fields is unclear. Weedy-margin vegetation may harbor pests or pathogens and may also serve as source populations for ongoing immigration of weeds into the field. It is also possible, however, that margin vegetation provides habitat for organisms that consume weed seeds or suppress the likelihood of pest or pathogen outbreak. We examined the nature of margin habitat using spatial-scaling of weed-species richness as an ecological assay. In 2003, we recorded the occurrence of weedy species along the perimeters of 63 fields in Wisconsin. The fields were distributed within six counties that differed in topography, geological history, local climate, and soil type and which spanned the range of variability in the agricultural landscape. We identified seven habitats that differed in geology and land use. The relationship between species richness and margin class was estimated using an analog of the power law. Additionally, we investigated broadscale correlates of habitat heterogeneity at the field level, using a modeling strategy that included additional explanatory factors logically connected to plant diversity. Using a model-confrontation approach, the survey supported the inclusion of two topographical diversity indices, elevation gradient and a field-shape index, into our model. Our broadscale survey provides information on one of a suite of important considerations needed to make decisions about the importance of managing weeds in field margins.

AB  - Land applications of manure from confined animal systems and direct deposit by grazing animals are both major sources of nutrients in streams. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of P-based manure applications on total suspended solids (TSS) and nutrient losses from dairy manures and poultry litter surface applied to pasturelands and to compare the nutrient losses transported to the edge of the field during overland flow events. Two sets of plots were established: one set for the study of in-field release and another set for the study of edge-of-the-field nutrient transport. Release plots were constructed at three pastureland sites (previous poultry litter applications, previous liquid dairy manure application, and no prior manure application) and received four manure treatments (turkey [Meleagris gallopavo] litter, liquid dairy manure, standard cowpies, and none). Pasture plots with a history of previous manure applications released higher concentrations of TSS and higher percentages of total P (TP) in the particulate form. Transport plots were developed on pasture with no prior manure application. The average flow-weighted TP concentrations were highest in runoff samples from the plots treated with cowpies (1.57 mg L-1). Reducing excess P in dairy cow diets and surface applying manure to the land using P-based management practices did not increase N concentrations in runoff. This study found that nutrients are most transportable from cowpies; thus a buffer zone between pastureland and streams or other appropriate management practices are necessary to reduce nutrient losses to waterbodies.

AB  - We assessed the relationship between riparian management and stream quality along five southeastern Minnesota streams in 1995 and 1996. Specifically, we examined the effect of rotationally and continuously grazed pastures and different types of riparian buffer strips on water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish as indicators of stream quality. We collected data at 17 sites under different combinations of grazing and riparian management, using a longitudinal design on three streams and a paired watershed design on two others. Continuous and rotational grazing were compared along one longitudinal study stream and at the paired watershed. Riparian buffer management, fenced trees (wood buffer), fenced grass, and unfenced rotationally grazed areas were the focus along the two remaining longitudinal streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) of water chemistry, physical habitat, and biotic data indicated a local management effect. The ordinations separated continuous grazing from sites with rotational grazing and sites with wood buffers from those with grass buffers or rotationally grazed areas. Fecal coliform and turbidity were consistently higher at continuously grazed than rotationally grazed sites. Percent fines in the streambed were significantly higher at sites with wood buffers than grass and rotationally grazed areas, and canopy cover was similar at sites with wood and grass buffers. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significant but were not consistent across grazing and riparian buffer management types. Fish density and abundance were related to riparian buffer type, rather than grazing practices. Our study has potentially important implications for stream restoration programs in the midwestern United States. Our comparisons suggest further consideration and study of a combination of grass and wood riparian buffer strips as midwestern stream management options, rather than universally installing wood buffers in every instance.

AB  - Understanding the influence of habitat alteration on population structure and persistence is critical for effective conservation strategies. Timber harvest and wildfire are two of the most prevalent disturbances across temperate forests, yet the long-term effects of these two forces on population connectivity have rarely been studied. We studied populations of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) across landscapes that have experienced either timber harvest or broad scale fires. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs generally require forested habitat, and are a species of concern in managed forests. We used landscape genetic techniques to test the explanatory power of alternative paths of connectivity across both burned and harvested forests and identified topographical and climatic variables that significantly influenced gene flow. We found that timber harvest and fire led to different patterns of genetic connectivity. Widespread terrestrial gene flow was maintained across previously burned areas and connectivity was primarily limited by solar radiation. In contrast, gene flow among populations in managed forests followed riparian corridors, presumably to avoid the loss of cover due to timber harvest. Gene flow along riparian corridors in Rocky Mountain tailed frogs differs from a population of the closely related coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), for which gene flow appears to occur primarily over land. These results suggest management of Rocky Mountain tailed frogs should focus on maintaining riparian buffer zones, which may be less effective for the coastal species. Thus, consideration of landscape differences is essential even for conservation of closely related, morphologically similar species.

AB  - Submitted paper is aimed on the analysis of recent stand structure of forest located in 1st buffer zone of the Klenovec water reservoir (WR). Data collection was performed on 4 permanent research plots, tree of them were established in Norway spruce stand, one in broadleaved part. For each PRP we measured the basic dendrometrical parameters as well as structural indexes. The analysis confirmed the significant tree height leveling (homogeneity) of the spruce stands. Through the evaluation of stand density index, we found out the average or good water protection effect of researched stands. The analysis of tree diameter structure by using of Fueldner index proved from low till medium differentiation of researched forest stands. Evaluation of spatial structure through the Clark-Evans index have pointed on fact that the autochthonous broadleaved stands located in 1st buffer zone shows tendency to clumping while the spruce stand manifests addiction to homogenous spatial distribution.

AB  - Main aim of submitted paper is to analyze the recent structure of forest stand located in 1st protection belt (buffer zone) of water reservoir Klenovec. Structure is evaluated in consideration of its impact on natural spruce regeneration. The long lasting absence of silvicultural interventions and omission of forest hygiene have resulted in recent stand structure. Mentioned fact is confirmed by high volume of stumps and snags (PRP V 39.8% and PRP XIII 11%) and by parameters of stand static stability (average crown ratio 43.7%, average slenderness ratio 109). Evidence of natural regeneration shows insufficient numbers of individuals with inappropriate height structure. AII spruce seedlings are grouped in height category up to 20 cm (PRP V 9 667 ind.haE-1, PRP VIII 1 333 ind.haE-1, PRP XIII 70 500 ind.haE-1). Abovementioned disproportion is probably caused by high competition pressure of herb layer on PRP V and PRP VII and by high canopy cover on PRP XIII.

AB  - The Mexican corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera zeae Krysan & Smith, is a serious pest of corn, Zea mays L., in several areas of Texas. Recent demonstrations of areawide adult control suggest this tactic has promise for rootworm management, but additional information regarding treatment thresholds and sampling methodology is needed. In 2000 and 2001 we examined the influence of distance into the field on rootworm captures by CRW and Pherocon AM traps, the fidelity of trap captures to population estimates from visual counts of beetles on plants (whole plant samples), and the seasonal population patterns indicated by each sampling method. Only the CRW trap consistently indicated reduced trap captures at the field margin compared with other distances. However, trends for the AM trap and whole plant samples suggested sampling on the field margin should be avoided. Population estimates at other distances into the field (2-30 m) were usually statistically similar. Thus, monitoring does not require trap placement far into the field. Both trap types indicated population peaks after flowering in corn, whereas plant samples indicated peak populations during tasseling and flowering. Both the CRW trap and plant samples showed the proportion of female beetles increased as the season progressed, but the CRW trap underestimated the proportion of females until after flowering. Regressions relating captures by traps to counts from plant samples indicated efficiency of both traps increased with increasing plant development. Our findings should increase acceptance of the CRW trap by producers and consultants and provide a rationale for development of improved, plant growth stage-specific treatment thresholds.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) reduce losses of nutrients, solids, and other materials from land area treated with fertilizers and manures. A number of models are available that simulate nutrient and sediment transport in VFS. While VFS eff ectiveness is considered to depend on lengths of pollutant source area and VFS areas, few published studies have tried to validate these models using variable pollutant source area and VFS area. The objective of this study was to validate an event-based nutrient transport model (Chaubey et al., 1995) that simulates soluble nutrient transport in VFS. This model links three sub-models: modified Green-Ampt infiltration, non-linear kinematic wave overland flow routing, and a nutrient transport component. The nutrient transport component considers infiltration as the only mechanism of pollutant removal from runoff. Data from a field plot experiment were used to validate the model. The model was executed using an uncalibrated runoff component, a calibrated runoff component, and measured runoff. The concentrations of parameters entering the VFS from three different poultry litter application lengths (6.1, 12.2, and 18.3 m) were not significantly different. However, predicted concentrations at subsequent lengths were different for all the three poultry litter application lengths. This finding was consistent with the observed data. Model execution with the uncalibrated runoff component, calibrated runoff component, and measured runoff underpredicted concentrations and mass transport at various locations along the length of the VFS. Underprediction of concentration was judged to be the reason for underprediction of mass transport. The agreement between the observed and predicted concentrations and mass transport, however, improved when runoff predictions from the calibrated runoff component and measured runoff were used.

AB  - Many regions in Africa are currently being converted from subsistence to cash crop farming such as cotton. Agricultural intensification is usually accompanied by increased use of pesticides, which can have an impact on non-target organisms. Bats are particularly sensitive to insecticide loads while providing substantial ecosystem services as predators of herbivorous insects. In this study, pesticide residues in bats in a landscape in northern Benin were investigated, which spanned a land use gradient from an agricultural zone dominated by cotton farms, through a buffer zone, and into a national park. Insecticides used in cotton cultivation, such as endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, flubendiamide, and spirotetramat, as well as persistent insecticides such as bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and aldrine, were analysed. Insecticide residues detected in bats comprised DDT, endosulfan, and their corresponding transformation products. Maximum concentrations in the sampled bats were 11.2� mg/kg lipid of p,p′-DDE (median: 0.0136� mg/kg lipid) and 0.797� mg/kg lipid of β-endosulfan (median: below detection limit [DL]). While insecticide concentrations were below lethal concentrations our data suggest that DDT had probably been recently used in the study region, and larger scale use would pose an increased risk for bat populations due to the high biomagnification of DDT.

AB  - Pollution swapping occurs when a mitigation option introduced to reduce one pollutant results in an increase in a different pollutant. Although the concept of pollution swapping is widely understood, it has received little attention in research and policy design. This study investigated diffuse pollution mitigation options applied in combinable crop systems. They are cover crops, residue management, no-tillage, riparian buffer zones, contour grass strips, and constructed wetlands. A wide range of water and atmospheric pollutants were considered, including nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and sulfur. It is clear from this investigation that there is no single mitigation option that will reduce all pollutants.

AB  - Pollution swapping can be defined as the increase in one pollutant as a result of a measure introduced to reduce a different pollutant. Although pollution swapping is widely understood it has received relatively little research attention and receives little consideration in agri-environmental policy. Evidence of pollution swapping in constructed wetlands, riparian buffer zones, cover crops, crop residue retention and no-tillage is examined in this paper. These widely used mitigation options are all successful at reducing diffuse pollutants but literature review shows that there is potential for them to increase levels of one or more other pollutants. There is potential for the widespread adoption of mitigation options to result in unexpected increases in some pollutants.There are a number of barriers to the recognition of pollution swapping in agri-environmental legislation including a lack of tools to evaluate the relative impacts of different pollutants, gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of mitigation measures on non-target pollutants and institutional barriers.

AB  - <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica;">A serological survey of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis was conducted in the foot-and-mouth disease buffer zone surrounding the Kruger National Park in South Africa between 2001 and 2003 to determine whether the withdrawal of government-subsidized dipping in certain regions had affected the seroprevalence of these tick-borne diseases. <em>Seroprevalence of Anaplasma marginale and Babesia bovis</em> increased during the study period. This increase was greater in Limpopo Province where farmers had to supply their own acaricide than in Mpumalanga Province where dipping materials were provided by the local Veterinary Services. The number of animals testing positive for <em>B. bigemina</em> decreased in both provinces during the study period, which was attributed to possible vector displacement rather than more effective tick control measures. Responses to a questionnaire on ticks and tick-borne diseases revealed local knowledge on the subject to be highly variable and sometimes incorrect.</span>

AB  - Current restoration of stream and lotic freshwater systems to ‘good ecological status’ has focused on the creation of vegetated riparian buffer strips. Yet, despite this constituting a major land‐use change, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these strips on riparian organisms. We investigated the effect that widespread adoption of buffer strips may have on activity density, species diversity, and assemblage composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Over 2� years, we sampled carabids from 41 riparian margins within two river catchments in north‐east Scotland. We compared three types of riparian margin: unbuffered (i.e. ‘unimproved’), vegetated buffer strips, and wooded, the latter acting as reference sites. A range of site parameters including characteristics of soil, water, and vegetation were recorded and the extent to which they correlated with ground beetle assemblages was explored. Catchment and treatment effects were detected on ground beetle activity density and species diversity with unbuffered sites showing higher activity density and species richness. The assemblage structure differed according to catchment, treatment, and local characteristics. Multivariate analysis suggested that soil and vegetation parameters and stream width, together with buffer strip age and length were determinants of assemblage structure. Few riparian species were found in large numbers. This study shows that in intensively managed agricultural landscapes riparian buffer strips do not create the quality of habitat required by truly riparian species. They do, however, provide habitat for woodland and stenotopic species and with more careful planning could play a role in increasing habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale.

AB  - Aims: To test the hypothesis that faecal coliform (FC) and phosphorus (P) are transported similarly in surface runoff through the vegetative filter strip after being released from land-applied manure. Methods and Results: The Hagerstown soil was packed into boxes that were 10 cm deep, 30 cm wide and 100, 200 or 300 cm long. Grass was grown in boxes prior experiments. Same-length boxes were placed under rainfall simulator and tilted to have with either 2% or 4% slopes. Dairy manure was broadcast on the upper 30-cm section. Rainfall was simulated and runoff samples were collected and analysed for Cl, FC and total phosphorus (TP). Mass recovery, the concentration decrease rate k, and the ratio FC : TP showed that there was a consistent relationship between FC and TP in runoff. Conclusion: The FC and TP transport through simulated vegetated buffer strips were highly correlated. Significance and Impact of the Study: As a knowledge base on the effect of the environmental parameters on P transport in vegetated buffer strips is substantially larger than for manure-borne bacteria, the observed similarity may enhance ability to assess the efficiency of the vegetated buffer strips in retention of FC currently used as indicator organisms for manure-borne pathogens.

AB  - While the application of precision agriculture technology to tactical, or within cropping season, decisions such as variable rate nutrient application may be an initial focus for producers, other decisions can be considered. Precision agriculture, as an information system, can provide data to help make spatially dependent strategic, or multiple cropping season, decisions. This research evaluates the economic benefit of filter strips on a diversified crop farm including corn and double cropped wheat with soybean. Economic analysis includes break-even computations permitting development of a decision-making criteria for the selection of these strips using historical yield monitor data. Results suggest that there is potential for this geographic information assisted process of filter strip delineation to increase overall net returns for producers with economically superior results to either a more naive approach of enrolling all eligible land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) or not participating in CRP. Furthermore, results suggest that information from precision agriculture, when coupled with appropriate economic analytical tools, can increase enrollment in CRP and enhance sustainability through increased profits and the environmental benefits from engaging in the CRP.

AB  - A comparison of different transportation route types and their combined effects on landscape diversity was conducted within Tiaoxi watershed (China) between 1994 and 2005. Buffer analysis and Mann–Kendall’s test were used to quantify the relationships between distance from transportation routes (railway, highway, national, and provincial road) and a family of landscape diversity parameters (Simpson’s diversity index, Simpson’s evenness index, Shannon’s diversity index, and Shannon’s evenness index). One-way ANOVA was further applied to compare influences from different route types and their combined effects. Five other landscape metrics (patch density, edge density, area-weighted mean shape index, connectance index, and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance) were also calculated to analyze the associations between landscape diversity and landscape pattern characteristics. Results showed that transportation routes exerted significant impacts on landscape diversity. Impact from railway was comparable to that from highway and national road but was more significant than that from provincial road. The spatial influential range of railway and national road was wider than that of highway and provincial road. Combined effects of routes were nonlinear, and impacts from different route types were more complex than those from the same type. The four landscape diversity metrics were comparably effective at the buffer zone scale. In addition, landscape diversity can be alternatively used to indicate fragmentation, connectivity, and isolation at route buffer scale. This study demonstrates an applicable approach to quantitatively characterize the impacts from transportation routes on landscape patterns and has potential to facilitate route network planning.

AB  - Spatial regression, incorporating spatial error or lag dependency, was performed to interpret determinants of hazardous chemicals at full sub-basin scale and at 500m riparian buffer scale in Qiantang River, eastern coastal China. Monitoring data from 41 monitoring stations were collected between 1996 and 2003 and pretreated for 7 variables—petroleum, hexavalent chromium, total cadmium, total lead, total mercury, total cyanide, and volatile phenol. Results showed that primary predictors and the predictive ability of spatial regression differed with variables and scales. Topology, distance to river source, land use/land cover (LULC), population density, and gross domestic product (GDP) can be primary predictors for the pattern of certain hazardous chemical variables in 1996 and 2003. LULC types were good predictors for changes of cyanide and heavy metals, while GDP and population density contributed to petroleum dynamics between 1996 and 2003. This study demonstrated that spatial regression is a promising tool for generating indicators to tackle with hazardous chemical pollution. We also advocate applying multi-scale approaches to uncover the dynamics of hazardous chemicals.

AB  - Carrot cavity spot, caused by a complex of Pythium species, is characterized by sunken elliptical lesions on the taproot. Recent epidemiological studies of P. violae have demonstrated the occurrence of both primary and secondary infections, with two types of secondary infection, autoinfection and alloinfection. Investigating the mechanisms underlying alloinfection and the role of carrot lateral roots, we asked whether direct physical root contact plays a role in alloinfection and whether root exudates enhance mycelial growth in soil alone. A rhizobox system was designed to differentiate the effects of each mechanism: a buffer zone created by nylon mesh was used to test the first mechanism, and young carrots with a root system similar to lateral roots were used to test the second. Alloinfections were generated in rhizoboxes via diseased taproots transplanted close to healthy, mature carrots. The nylon mesh had no significant effect on disease intensity (reflecting alloinfection), providing evidence that mycelial growth in soil contributed more to disease spread than did physical contact among roots. Nor did young carrots significantly affect alloinfection; thus root exudates had little effect on mycelial growth.

AB  - An experimental study was conducted in Tillamook, Oregon, USA, to quantify the effectiveness of edge-of-field vegetated buffers for reducing transport of fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) from agricultural fields amended with dairy cow manure. Installation of vegetated buffers on loamy soils dramatically reduced the bacterial contamination of runoff water from manure-treated pasturelands, but the size of the vegetated buffer was not an important determinant of bacterial removal efficiency. Only 10% of the runoff samples collected from treatment cells having vegetated buffers exhibited FCB concentrations >200 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL (a common water quality standard value), and the median concentration for all cells containing vegetated buffers was only 6 cfu/100 mL. The presence of a vegetated buffer of any size, from 1 to 25 m, generally reduced the median FCB concentration in runoff by more than 99%. Results for FCB load calculations were similar. Our results suggest that where substantial FCB contamination of runoff occurs from manure-treated pasturelands, it might be disproportionately associated with specific field or management conditions, such as the presence of soils that exhibit low water infiltration and generate larger volumes of runoff or the absence of a vegetated buffer. Buffer size regulations that do not consider such differences might not be efficient or effective in reducing bacterial contamination of runoff.

AB  - Scientific interpretation of the relationships between urban landscape patterns and water quality is important for sustainable urban planning and watershed environmental protection. This study applied the ordinary least squares regression model and the geographically weighted regression model to examine the spatially varying relationships between 12 explanatory variables (including three topographical factors, four land use parameters, and five landscape metrics) and 15 water quality indicators in watersheds of Yundang Lake, Maluan Bay, and Xinglin Bay with varying levels of urbanization in Xiamen City, China. A local and global investigation was carried out at the watershed-level, with 50 and 200� m riparian buffer scales. This study found that topographical features and landscape metrics are the dominant factors of water quality, while land uses are too weak to be considered as a strong influential factor on water quality. Such statistical results may be related with the characteristics of land use compositions in our study area. Water quality variations in the 50� m buffer were dominated by topographical variables. The impact of landscape metrics on water quality gradually strengthen with expanding buffer zones. The strongest relationships are obtained in entire watersheds, rather than in 50 and 200� m buffer zones. Spatially varying relationships and effective buffer zones were verified in this study. Spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and water quality parameters are more diversified and complex in less urbanized areas than in highly urbanized areas. This study hypothesizes that all these varying relationships may be attributed to the heterogeneity of landscape patterns in different urban regions. Adjustment of landscape patterns in an entire watershed should be the key measure to successfully improving urban lake water quality.

AB  - The lower Tarim River had dried up nearly 30years before an ecological water diversion project (EWDP) for ecological restoration was implemented in 2000. Since then, eight intermittent water deliveries have been carried out for restoring this seriously degraded riparian ecosystem. To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of these operations, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set derived from bands 1 and 2 of the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA's Terra satellite was applied to identify the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover along the river corridor with about 320km in length. The goal of this study is thus to generate seasonally integrated NDVI (SINDVI) in growing seasons between April and October so as to investigate a general vegetation patterns as well as examine the inter-annual SINDVI for discerning the status of ecosystem restoration. The spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover were further characterized based on those inter-annual SINDVI data with the aid of Coefficient of Variation (CoV). Research findings indicate that ecosystem integrity was strengthened after a series of water diversion efforts and groundwater table control in the past few years. As the degree of ecosystem restoration is in progress, continuous operation of water diversion is still necessary in response to the needs for restoration of dense vegetation in the riparian buffer within this arid or semi-arid region.

AB  - Forest resource conservation has been widely accepted as a key to sustain the local and regional economic development. The forest edges are affected by anthropogenic activities including deforestation, forest fragmentation, selective logging, extraction of non-timber forest products, collection of medicinal plants, recreations, hydroelectric projects and its associated developmental activities, which alter the biodiversity. The present study intends to evaluate the edge effect on vegetation structure and species compositions in the tropical forest ecosystems at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Western Ghats. High species richness (number of species) and Shannon’s diversity indices were observed in the site III (completely undisturbed forest) compared to site I (adjacent to the village/ edge of the forest, which is next to the teak plantation, severely disturbed forest) and site II (in between the undisturbed forest and moderately disturbed forest) while density of tree species showed greater value in site II. Single species such as Tectona grandis (IVI of 80) and Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 112) were the dominant tree species in site I and site II, respectively, whereas, in site III Terminalia bellirica, Bishofia javanica and Syzgium gardneri shared the dominance. Perturbation leads to alien plant invasion particularly Lantana camara, Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conizoides. Site II is at forest transition level because the site is dominated by both natural species as well as plantation species such as Tectona grandis. This site seems to be a buffer zone on natural forest and plantations. Further studies are required to analyse the real patterns of regeneration and dynamic change due to human impact by long term monitoring with the establishment of permanent plots.

AB  - Restoration of riparian buffers is an important component of nutrient reduction strategies in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In 1998, Maryland adopted a Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which provides financial incentives to take agricultural land out of production to plant streamside vegetation. Between 1998 and 2005, 1-30% of streamside vegetation (average = 11%), was restored to forest or managed grass in 15 agriculturally dominated sub-basins in the Choptank River basin, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Pre-existing forested buffers represented 10-48% of the streamside (average = 33%), for a total of 12-61% buffered streamsides (average = 44%). Using multi-year water quality data collected before and after CREP implementation (1986, 2003-2006), we were unable to detect significant effects of CREP on baseflow nutrient concentrations based on the area of restored buffer, the percentage of restored streamside, or the percentage of total riparian buffer in the sub-basins (p > 0.05). Although CREP increased the average buffered streamside from 33% in the 1990s to 44% by 2005, N and P concentrations have not changed or have increased in some streams over the last 20 years. Reductions may not have occurred for the following reasons: (1) buffer age, width, and connectivity (gaps) between buffers are also important to nutrient reductions; (2) agricultural nutrient inputs may have increased during this period; and (3) riparian buffer restoration was not extensive enough by 2005 to have measurable affects on the stream water quality in these sub-basins. Significant effects of CREP may yet be resolved as the current CREP buffers mature; however, water quality data through 2006 in the Choptank basin do not yet show any significant effects.

Use of a nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) balance to determine land requirements appropriate for the facility size and type of manure management system will provide considerable separation distance. Procedures and examples for determining a phosphorus and nitrogen balance and resulting theoretical minimum separation distances were presented. Results of field odor concentration measurements at two swine operations of differing size and type were presented, along with the required distances to reach near-background odor levels.

AB  - Effect of Chlorpyrifos (Lorsban) has been studied on the mean activity density and body measures (i.e., total body length, carapace length, carapace width and wet weight) of wolf spiders in the field. Significant difference was recorded in the mean activity density of wolf spiders in the treated and control field. Mean activity density of wolf spiders collected from different distances from field's margin of both fields (i.e., treated and control) also differed significantly. Chlorpyrifos did not show any negative effect on the growth of Pardosa birmanica Simon, 1884, while it affected the growth of carapace and wet weight in Lycosa terrrestris Butt et al., 2006. It is concluded that application of chlorpyrifos in the fields may reduce the density of wolf spiders not only because of direct mortality but also due to disturbance and emigration, thus reducing the pest control potential of this important predatory group.

AB  - Mirid bugs, major insect pests in rice production, have dramatically expanded their range in Japan, resulting in increased economic losses especially for organic rice farmers. In this study, the within-field and landscape-scale factors affecting the bug and its damage to crops were examined in organic rice farms. Bug densities and crop damage levels showed significant positive relationships with weed densities (Schoenoplectus juncoides and Echinochloa crus-galli) within individual fields. Bug densities were negatively associated with Tetragnatha spp. and Pachygnatha clercki densities, indicating that these spiders act as biological control agents that help to decrease crop damage levels. At the landscape scale, bug densities increased with the proportion of the area that was fallow within a 400-m radius around focal fields. Fallows represent important source habitat for the bug and the spatial extent at which bug abundance was affected indicates the mobility of these insects. These results suggest that the combination of biological control by natural enemies, and weed management within individual paddies and surrounding landscapes inside a buffer zone of less than half a kilometre may be effective in controlling mirid bugs and the damage they cause in organic paddy fields.

AB  - Arundinaria gigantea, or river cane, is a potential riparian buffer, and there is general interest in the restoration of the species to the southern Appalachian mountains. Proper classification of A. gigantea is critical in determining suitable candidate sites for planting. The 1988 National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands lists A. gigantea as facultative wetland (FACW) for the southeast and elsewhere. In this article, we review plant, soil, and hydrologic data collected at 20 A. gigantea sites in western North Carolina, USA, and discuss the species wetland classification in light of our findings. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat), bulk density (ρb), elemental abundance, soil description, plant identification, and hydrologic data are presented and suggest that river cane is currently classified incorrectly, and that an upland (UPL) or facultative upland (FACU) classification is more appropriate. None of the sites studied meet all 3 criteria common to wetland definitions (hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology), although one of the sites had several wetland characteristics. We suggest that river cane restoration should occur in well drained, sandy soils and that the species should only be used as a riparian buffer in this type of setting.

AB  - In May to July 2002, potential pests (phytophagous insects specialised on cruciferous plants) and their natural enemies (hymenopterous parasitoids and carabids as predators) were studied in an organic winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) field in Estonia using yellow and black water traps and pitfall traps. Of the potential pests - Meligethes aeneus and Ceutorhynchus assimilis were the most numerous. However, the only fed on the rape plants and did not reproduce there. Their population were low with peaks in early June. the peaks coincided with the population peaks of parasitic wasps including Phradis morionellus, a larval parasitoid of Meligethes aeneus, and Mesopolobus morys, Stenomalina gracilis and Trichomalus perfectus, larval parasitoids of Ceutorhynchus assimilis. 41 taxa of carabids were caught. Among them, the genus Pterostichus dominated, with P. cupreus and P. melanarius being the most numerous species. The presence of natural meadow as a field margin increased the abundance of potential pests, their parasitoids and the diversity of carabid species.

AB  - Findings showed that underlying rocks were generally made up of intercalated, fine-grained, tuffaceous sedimentary units that have wide range porosity and permeability attributes. The finer ones - mudstone, silty clay; and shale interbed are characteristically favorable materials as underlying materials to host a SWDS. These relatively finer sediments normally retarded the downward migration and/or percolation of leachate, which effectively helped prevent possible contamination of the groundwater. The presence of these finer materials balanced the adverse impact of the more permeable siltstone layers mapped in the area. The geomorphology of the area, characterized by deeply entrenched erosional gullies, provided favorable locations for SWDS [solid waste disposal site] as boundaries that could serve as natural barriers necessary for containment of large volume of solid waste. The generally northwest-northeast directions of the natural drainage flow, the perceived northeast hydraulic gradient as signified and determined by the attitudes of bedding structure and bedding planes, were identified as the major geological controls that could influence leachate migration in the area. These findings favor the development of the site into a SWDS. The perceived depth of groundwater in the proposed SWDS was sufficiently deep, at least 34 m below surface, thus providing ample separation between the groundwater and leachate-generating wastes. The buffer zone and the depth of groundwater, in effect, provided ample lateral and vertical buffer zone to control and considerably reduce within acceptable limits the environmental and health hazards though proper engineering intervention. The availability of shale and clay-size materials, confirmed from mapping of road-cuts along Barangays [villages] Nicolas Agatep and Gabun, could be utilized as back fill material for grading purposes during the initial site preparation. This type of material could be admixed wilh silt-sized or fine sand material to achieve desired permeability values as soil liner and solid waste comes during and after the operational life of the dumpsite

AB  - The protected areas of South Africa are strategically important in meeting global and national biodiversity conservation targets, as well as contributing to socio-economic development in local areas. Often this latter deliverable is difficult as the protected areas are small and the communities outside are large, as was the case with Abe Bailey nature reserve, situated in a peri-urban setting outside Carletonville’s (Gauteng Province, South Africa) largest township, Khutsong. Rapid Rural Appraisal workshops were held in 2000 with community groups in Khutsong (youth, aged, shack dwellers, home based care, traditional healers) to determine their needs in relation to the nature reserve. A social survey was also undertaken to fully understand the dynamics of the Khutsong community as the relationship between community and nature reserve had previously been hostile. The output was an outreach programme that included establishing a buffer-zone between Khutsong and nature reserve; a system of vegetable garden allotments set up along the boundary of the park and township; a medicinal plant cultivation project; and a donor-funded medicinal plant ‘rescue’ scheme with greenhouse tunnels set up in the nature reserve. Between 2003 and 2008, disaster struck Khutsong in the form of the border demarcation protests resulting in substantial violence and damage to property in the area. This violence stalled all the Abe Bailey community projects. Substantial investment would be needed to activate these projects again. This situation indicates the struggle that protected areas on the border of large urban settlements face with service delivery protests a feature of the South African urban landscape at present. This paper outlines the steps taken to establish these projects, as well as the outcomes and future of these projects.

AB  - The Abe Bailey Nature Reserve (ABNR) in the Gauteng Province of South Africa is largely unknown and offers little to attract visitors. The biological integrity of the ABNR is challenged by the urban poverty in Khutsong, the reserve’s immediate neighbour. Relations between Khutsong and the nature reserve had been hostile for decades as a result of the ‘fortress’ style of conservation protection used for the ABNR. However, this situation provided the Gauteng Directorate of Nature Conservation with an opportunity to experiment with dentifying and transferring benefits to the community, as well as establishing an effective buffer zone between the nature reserve and the informal settlements of Khutsong. Following an initial rapid rural appraisal and ongoing liaison through specifically appointed project managers, an outreach programme containing two natural resource-based projects was developed. As a result, better relations were established between the ABNR and its neighbouring community for the first time since the nature reserve was established in 1977. This acted as ‘insurance’ during violent public protests and vandalism in the Khutsong border demarcation dispute (2005–2007), but may not be enough to secure the nature reserve into the future.  Conservation implications:  Small protected areas may not be effective in ensuring their biological integrity in the long term, but working cooperatively with existing and future neighbours is an essential strategy to optimise conservation activities in small reserves such as the ABNR.

AB  - Conflicts due to damage caused by wildlife pose serious threats to conservation. In addition, wildlife damage incurs severe economic loss to communities living in the close vicinity of the park, affecting the livelihoods and well-being of locals. While different studies have emphasised identification and quantification of crop damage problems, studies highlighting the means used for crop protection and their effectiveness are limited. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of means used by communities to protect their crops against wildlife. 117 households were visited at two Buffer Zone villages of Bardia National Park, Nepal. Findings suggested that crop depredation by wildlife was a function of several factors, such as the distance of the farmland from the park, the size of the crop raiding animals and the frequency of attacks on the farmland, and the type of crops. Ten different means were identified by communities which were used regularly to prevent crop damage. Households combined both traditional and modern means to guard their crop against the wild animals. Means differed according to the animals as well as crops being protected. Among all these means, Machan (i.e. watch towers) combined with other means such as throwing flaming sticks and group shouting were the most effective and safest modes of crop guarding for all kinds of animals and crops. Trench and Bio-fencing were effective mostly for deer species. However, crop guarding was an intensive process and no means were able to completely prevent crop damage. Problem animals differed according to the villages and crops being damaged, which suggests that employment of single means would be ineffective. Site-specific management strategies and economic as well as technical support from funding organisations would be most useful to minimise crop loss. In addition information exchange and learning between farmers and the park management about different mitigating means could support and prepare farmers for improvement in the means.

AB  - Repeated biomass harvesting for human livelihood needs can cause significant changes in forest structure, composition and diversity. Such impacts have often been associated with the distance to villages and their size, but the effects of individual villages in relation to their characteristics have been little studied. Focussing on the issues around communities' impacts on the forest, this research aimed to understand how resource extraction by two Buffer Zone villages in Nepal's Bardia National Park affects forest structure and diversity. Tree density, basal area, diameter at breast height (DBH), species richness, two diversity indices and disturbance indices were recorded in 108 plots in 12 transects, from March till May 2005, within the park along the village boundaries, where resource extraction occurs, and in the core park area which is isolated from human disturbance. Forest subject to resource extraction had a lower density of trees, smaller DBH and lower species richness and diversity. Forest disturbance declined with distance from the villages but the two villages differed widely in their impact on the forest. Resource use was more intensive in Shivapur village and percentage of trees lopped, average lopping intensity and numbers of dung piles were statistically significant. This was mainly due to the lack of access to Buffer Zone community Forest for Shivapur households. Interviews with villagers suggested that there have been changes in species availability compared to 5 years ago. Households also underestimated the impact of their resource extraction, which may prevent them from changing their behaviour to benefit conservation. It is clear that understanding rural communities' needs, their framing of resource extraction and utilisation, and dependence on forest resources will be very helpful for long term conservation measures.

AB  - Biological pest control has primarily relied on local improvements in populations of natural enemies, but landscape structure may also be important. This is shown here with experiments at different spatial scales using the rape pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The presence of old field margin strips along rape fields was associated with increased mortality of pollen beetles resulting from parasitism and adjacent, large, old fallow habitats had an even greater effect. In structurally complex landscapes, parasitism was higher and crop damage was lower than in simple landscapes with a high percentage of agricultural use.

AB  - A block design field experiment with ten variants per block and 38 replications, was carried out to test the suitability of microplots (0,1 square metre) for measuring competition between a cereal crop and weeds. Natural Apera spica-venti infestations in winter wheat were used. The densities of natural A. spica-venti infestations were adjusted only when insufficient variation within the block occurred. The main reason for using natural densities was the reduction of required labor. The effect of crop density on yield was determined using linear correlation- and regression analysis. Experimental error (probably due to soil differences) increased the variation in yield between the blocks. Independently of this variation, blocks having higher initial weed densities were located in areas where lower yields were observed. Despite systematical experimental errors associated with the use of this block design, valid results were obtained, as these errors could be statistically compensated. Other types of experimental error such as border- and neighbor effects could not be quantified. To exclude errors of this kind a buffer zone should be added by increasing the area of microplots to 1 square metre of which only the center 0,5 square metre should be harvested. The correlation between density of A. spica-venti and wheat yield was highly significant. One hundred plants reduced yield at an average of 2,3 dt/ha

AB  - Field margin strips, sown with either the main field crop, rye grass (Lolium perenne), a grass and wild flower mixture, or left to natural regeneration, were established in replicated plots along three hedgerows and field edges. Pitfall traps were used to assess the carabid beetle fauna in mid-summer between 1993 and 1996. Suction sampling was used to assess a wider range of arthropod taxa in June 1994. Pitfall data showed no significant overall effects from plot-type although significant differences in carabid activity-density were found between fields and years. In contrast, suction sampling showed marked differences between the crop, the hedge and the plots with different vegetation structures. There was a significant positive correlation between faunal and floral diversity, with anthropod diversity lowest in the crop, low in the crop edge, higher in the more diverse sown plots and highest in the hedge. Studies of over-wintering arthropods from soil samples revealed similar trends, confirming that arthropods colonised sown margin strips within 11-15 months of establishment. The results indicate that the appropriate scale for using pitfall traps is at the field rather than the plot scale. The introduction of botanically diverse field margin strips is shown to be an important method of increasing the anthropod diversity of semi-natural habitat in farmland.

AB  - In many countries, high densities of domestic cats (Felis catus) are found in urban habitats where they have the potential to exert considerable predation pressure on their prey. However, little is known of the ranging behaviour of cats in the UK. Twenty cats in suburban Reading, UK, were fitted with GPS trackers to quantify movement patterns. Cats were monitored during the summer and winter for an average of 6.8 24 h periods per season. Mean daily area ranged (95 % MCP) was 1.94 ha. Including all fixes, mean maximum area ranged was 6.88 ha. These are broadly comparable to those observed in urban areas in other countries. Daily area ranged was not affected by the cat’s sex or the season, but was significantly larger at night than during the day. There was no relationship between area ranged and habitat availability. Taking available habitat into account, cat ranging area contained significantly more garden and other green space than urban habitats. If cats were shown to be negatively affecting prey populations, one mitigation option for consideration in housing developments proposed near important wildlife sites would be to incorporate a ‘buffer zone’ in which cat ownership was not permitted. Absolute maximum daily area ranged by a cat in this study was 33.78 ha.

AB  - Effects of riparian harvesting on in-stream biota were monitored in five streams in exotic conifer plantations that differed in how logs were extracted, patterns in deposition of woody debris, and the degree to which riparian buffers were retained. Streams were sampled on three occasions in summer, once prior to harvesting and twice afterwards. Consistent effects of harvesting included an increase in the amount of woody debris in the channel, increased fine sediment and a trend towards higher algal productivity. Invertebrate communities changed dramatically in some streams. General patterns included an increase in small sized taxa and taxa with generalist diets in the first year after harvest, then a trend towards a greater representation of grazers and larger taxa the following year. Responses in particular taxa were highly variable between streams. Some of this variability was related to forestry management, the least dramatic changes occurring where a narrow riparian buffer strip was retained. Reduced impacts were also observed in streams where woody debris was piled over the channel. We suggest that management practices that maintain shading of the stream channel will moderate forestry effects, and that practices such as channel cleaning are likely to be detrimental.

AB  - Tall fescue vegetative filter strips 0.5 to 4.0 m wide were evaluated for their ability to reduce losses of metolachlor, metribuzin, and runoff (water and sediment) in conventionally tilled soybean. Differences in the parameters studied were significant between filter and no filter strips, regardless of filter strip width. Two days after treatment, metribuzin concentration in runoff from the unfiltered treatment was 231 ng ml-1; filter strips reduced this amount to 119 ng ml-1 or less. Similar trends were observed with metolachlor, with concentrations of 1,009 ng ml-1 from the unfiltered, whereas filter strips of any width reduced this to 523 ng ml-1 or less. Metribuzin loss during the growing season was 41 g ai ha-1, or 9.8% of the amount applied when no filter strip was present. The addition of a filter strip, regardless of width, reduced cumulative metribuzin losses to 11 g ha-1 or less. Similar results were noted with metolachlor. Filter strips, regardless of width, reduced cumulative runoff and sediment loss at least 46 and 83%, respectively

AB  - The Mui Ca Mau National Park in Vietnam is a coastal ecosystem consisting of Protected Zone, Marine Conservation and Buffer Zone. Over the years, patches of mangrove communities have evolved in the Protected Zone. The formation of community patches may be a reflection of the variability of the environmental factors prevailing in the habitat at National Park. This study was conducted in order to understand the relationships of mangrove forests and their environment in Cau Mau National Park. Eight sampling sites representing eight ecological communities were selected along gradients from the seashores to the inlands of the Protected Zone. At each sampling sites, two transects perpendicular to each other were laid out from which mangrove plant samples were taken. Samples of soils and surface water were taken from each sampling sites for physico-chemical analysis of abiotic variables. Species of aquatic animals were recorded from interview of people who are collecting unprohibited mangrove species. Policies on protected areas in Vietnam were secured from the Forest Protection and Management Board of Mui Ca Mau National Park. All these baseline data were subjected to statistical analysis. Results show at least 10 mangrove plant species are present in the Park and about 95 percent of which consists of Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia alba, and A. officinalis. At 79.24 percent similarity coeficients, three distinct zones emerged out of 8 patches. These are: Southeastern Coast Zone dominated by R. apiculata and A. alba; Western Coast Zone dominated by A. alba and A. officinalis; and Inland Zone with R. apiculata, A. alba, Bruguiera parviflora as the dominant species. The floristic abundance at Ca Mau National Park is largely determined by the pH of dry soil, percentage sand and compaction of the soil. There were 8 dominant animal species found in the Park. Their presence is favored by the combination of 4 physical variables, namely, soil compaction, organic matter, total nitrogen, and tidal inundated times, and by the abundance of Bruguiera sexangula and R. apiculata mangrove species. Government policies on protected areas may have contributed to the stability of the National Park in at least two areas. The first one is on the strict enforcement of the law prohibiting poaching inside the park. Second, the establishment of the Buffer Zone prevented the influx of poor farmers to the Protected Zone.  The implications of these findings to the environmental management of the Park have been discussed.

AB  - Human alveolar echinococcosis, caused by the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, is one of the most pathogenic zoonoses in the temperate and arctic region of the Northern Hemisphere. To investigate the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis and the factors influencing this distribution in the recently identified endemic area of Hungary, 1612 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses were randomly collected from the whole Hungarian territory from November 2008 to February 2009 and from November 2012 to February 2013. The topographic positions of foxes were recorded in geographic information system database. The digitized home ranges and the vector data were used to calculate the altitude, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil water retention, soil permeability, areas of land cover types and the presence and buffer zone of permanent water bodies within the fox territories. The intestinal mucosa from all the foxes was tested by sedimentation and counting technique. Multiple regression analysis was performed with environmental parameter values and E. multilocularis counts. The spatial distribution of the parasite was clumped. Based on statistical analysis, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation were the major determinants of the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis in Hungary. It can be attributed to the sensitivity of E. multilocularis eggs to high temperatures and desiccation. Although spreading and emergence of the parasite was observed in Hungary before 2009, the prevalence and intensity of infection did not change significantly between the two collection periods. It can be explained by the considerably lower annual precipitation before the second collection period.

AB  - A watershed’s riparian corridor presents opportunities to stabilize streambanks, intercept runoff, and influence shallow groundwater with riparian buffers. This paper presents a system to classify these riparian opportunities and apply it towards riparian management planning in HUC12 watersheds. High resolution (3-m grid) digital elevation models derived from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data are analyzed to identify spatial distributions of surface runoff contributions and shallow water tables in a watershed’s riparian zones. Results are tabulated and a cross classification is applied to convey recommendations for buffer vegetation and width. Classes of buffers include those primarily placed to: 1) trap runoff and sediment; 2) influence shallow groundwater; 3) address both runoff and shallow groundwater, and; 4) maintain/improve stream bank stability. This system was applied to two headwater watersheds from each of three landform regions found in Iowa and Illinois. Riparian buffers that could intercept runoff and/or stabilize streambanks would occupy about 2.5% of the total areas of these watersheds, but intercept runoff contributions from 81-94% of the watersheds. However, the distributions of riparian zones where shallow water tables (SWT) were >25 m wide varied according to landform region. Nevertheless, these riparian zones with a wide SWT area were the most common riparian setting in all six watersheds, and found to occupy 23-53% of stream bank lengths among the six watersheds. The wide SWT setting provides opportunities to reduce nutrient loads carried via groundwater, and could be managed for a variety of ecosystem services. This riparian classification and mapping system should provide a consistent basis for developing riparian corridor plans and identifying management priorities in Midwestern headwater catchments where high resolution elevation data are available.

AB  - In the buffer zone of the Lamto Reserve, a protected area located in the forest-savannah transitional zone in central Ivory Coast, the exotic shrub Chromolaena odorata has invaded abandoned fields and degraded forests. As a result, they have turned into thickets that are used by local farmers as natural fallows to enhance soil fertility for food production. However, information about their impact on soil is scanty and investigations focusing exclusively on baseline data on C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs are still lacking. This study was designed to assess changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties after the establishment of C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs of Ivory Coast. Sampling sites were selected such that a portion of C. odorata fallow was located next to the shrub savannah, the most common natural ecosystem in the area. Results revealed a rise of soil organic carbon (+27.9%), total nitrogen (+36.7%), total phosphorus (+56.8%), extractable calcium (+68.3) and magnesium (+140.3%) in the first 10cm of soil beneath the C. odorata fallow relative to the savannah. Furthermore, the fallow was associated with high N-mineral pool as N-NO₃ ⁻ and N-NH₄ ⁺ content increased at +72.5% and +71.5%, respectively. The infiltration capacity of water under C. odorata-based fallow was markedly high and soil macroinvertebrates, mainly earthworms, showed significant increases in density and biomass. The large quantity of good quality standing biomass produced by C. odorata is likely the main factor controlling the improvement of soil quality. The results suggest that there are merits for the integration of C. odorata fallow in a cropping system for sustainable food production in the buffer zone of Lamto Reserve. This can also help to reduce pressure on forest islands.

AB  - Sub-pixel analysis is capable of generating continuous fields, which represent the spatial variability of certain thematic classes. The aim of this work was to develop numerical models to represent the variability of tree cover and bare surfaces within the study area. This research was conducted in the riparian buffer within a watershed of the São Francisco River in the North of Minas Gerais, Brazil. IKONOS and Landsat TM imagery were used with the GUIDE algorithm to construct the models. The results were two index images derived with regression trees for the entire study area, one representing tree cover and the other representing bare surface. The use of non-parametric and non-linear regression tree models presented satisfactory results to characterize wetland, deciduous and savanna patterns of forest formation.

AB  - The nesting biology of the leafcutting bee Megachile (Pseudocentron) gomphrenoides Vachal (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) was studied in an agro-ecosystem in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Data were obtained from trap-nests placed in the field margin during two agricultural years (2008/2009 and 2009/2010). Females made an average of 7.55 cells per nest, and used leaves of at least three plant species to build their nests. Provisions of cells were principally of Asteraceae pollen. Adult emergence showed a bimodal pattern suggesting a facultative bivoltinism life cycle. Approximately, 30� % of all offspring failed to complete development to the adult stage and an additional 10� % were killed by natural enemies. These included parasitic wasps (Eulophidae: Melittobia and Horismenus), a cleptoparasite bee (Megachilidae: Coelioxys), and a bristle beetle (Meloidae: Tetraonyx). The host/cleptoparasite association between M. gomphrenoides and Coelioxys remissa constitutes the first such record for both species, and the Megachile–Tetraonyx interaction was previously unknown. M. gomphrenoides possesses some characteristics that make it an interesting potential opportunity to use this species for pollination of commercial sunflowers in the Pampean region.

AB  - Spiders were collected by pitfall trapping in winter wheat from late April until harvest, early July in 1992 and during the whole growing period from early November of 1992 to early July of 1993 in North Hungary. Traps were placed in the field margin and in the field at different distances from the margin. Our preliminary report is based on catches of traps placed in the middle of the field. Total of 1237 individuals (50 species of 13 families) were caught. 95 of these individuals were adults. Most of these were wolf spiders (Lycosidae, 49,8, 9 species), followed by money spiders (Linyphiidae, 34,9, 14 species) and gnaphosids (Gnaphosidae, 4,7, 10 species). Dominant species were the lycosid Pardosa agrestis (Westring) and the linyphiid Oedothorax apicutas (Blackwall). Some preliminary details on differences between the spider fauna of Hungarian and Western European winter wheat fields are discussed

AB  - Summer stream water quality was monitored before and following the logging of 50% of the boreal forest within three small watersheds (<50 ha) nested in the 'Ruisseau des Eaux-Volées' Experimental Watershed, Montmorency Forest (Québec, Canada). Logging was conducted in winter, on snow cover according to recommended best management practices (BMPs) to minimize soil disturbance and protect advance growth. A 20-m forest buffer was maintained along perennial streams. In watershed 7·2, cut-blocks were located near the stream network and logging was partially allowed within the riparian buffer zone. In watersheds 7·5 and 7·7, logging occurred farther away from the stream network. Observations were also made for watershed 7·3 that collected the runoff from watersheds 7·2 and 7·5, and watershed 7·6, the uproad portion of watershed 7·7. The control watershed 0·2 was contiguous to the impacted watersheds and remained undisturbed. Following clearcutting, changes in summer daily maximum and minimum stream temperatures remained within ± 1 °C while changes in diurnal variation did not decrease by more than 0·5 °C. Concentrations of NO₃ ⁻ greatly increased by up to 6000% and concentrations of K⁺ increased by up to 300% during the second summer after logging. Smaller increases were observed for Fetotal (up to 71%), specific conductance (up to 26%), and Mg²⁺ (up to 19%). Post-logging pH decreased slightly by no more than 7% while PO₄ ³⁻ concentration remained relatively constant. Suspended sediment concentrations appeared to increase during post-logging, but there was not enough pre-logging data to statistically confirm this result. Logging of moderate intensity and respecting established BMPs may account for the limited changes of water quality parameters and the low exceedances of the criteria for the protection of aquatic life. The proximity of the cutover to the stream network and logging within the riparian zone did not appear to affect water quality. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Dadia forest complex, in the Evros prefecture, in north eastern Greece was designated as a nature reserve in 1980 in order to protect the black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and other raptors. In this paper, the impacts of the protection on the forest growth were assessed using geographic information system (GIS) technologies. The major requirement for almost all research needed for sustainable forest management is extensive and intensive monitoring. GIS is a convenient tool for integrating remotely sensed data and various other kinds geo-referenced data. Detailed spatial and temporal change patterns of the land uses in the area were quantified by interpreting aerial photographs of the years 1945 and 1973 and a satellite image of 2001. The results showed that the rate of forest growth is significantly larger during the second period (1973-2001) than during the earlier one (1945-1973). This is mostly due to the introduction, in 1980, of a protection regime, including two high-protection core areas, and a buffer zone. From 1945 to 2001 the openings which are important as hunting biotopes for raptors were significantly decreased. Apart from the protection of the area that was played an important role in the forest changes the effects of various landscape parameters (elevation, slope, distance from the roads and urban areas, aspect, soil depth, geology, erosion and forest density) on these changes were examined.

AB  - Although a national strategy for the coexistence of GM and conventional/organic crops in Ireland has been published (), measures pertaining to the coexistence of GM and non-GM oilseed rape (OSR) crops was omitted pending the completion of regional specific research. As the evaluation of gene flow between coexisting OSR varieties cannot be solely studied through field experiments and to assist policy makers in the generation of coexistence guidelines for GM herbicide tolerant (HT) OSR, the present work utilized the gene flow model GeneSys to simulate the influence of management strategies on gene escape from GM OSR across the Irish agri-environment. The model predicted that the incorporation of GMHT OSR into an existing winter wheat-based rotation without a complimentary modification to the cropping regime would rapidly compromise coexistence, recorded as the % harvest impurities in non-GM OSR crops at the silo and the % of non-GM OSR fields whose harvest exceeded the European Union labelling threshold of 0.9% GM content. Enhanced herbicide efficacy, the application of spring weed control, the inclusion of a single spring crop (potato, barley, maize) post-OSR, reduced regional harvest impurities in non-GM OSR crops below the 0.9% threshold. The simulations showed that the establishment of GM zones by clustering of GMHT OSR fields presents for early adopters a viable mechanism to achieve coexistence with neighboring non-GM OSR sites. By incorporating a 50m non-OSR (GM/non-GM) buffer zone to circumvent each GM cluster, the simulations concluded that regional harvest purity can be assured with up to 6 separate clusters accommodating up to 10% regional GM adoption across the landscape. Significantly, these simulations were completed using GMHT OSR as a break crop in the standard winter wheat rotation, which in previous simulations was deemed to be impractical for coexistence purposes. Organizing cultivation through GM clusters, presents a workable option to those early adopters who will seek to investigate the potential of the technology by (i) concentrating the necessity for intensive volunteer control in a specific, localised area (ii) increasing the potential for allocating machinery via GM/non-GM purposes and (iii) facilitating regulatory requirements in regards to farmer-to-farmer communication.

AB  - The various applications and effectiveness of Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) hedges were reviewed and discussed at the International Vetiver Grass Field Workshop in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 13 to 16 April 1992. In India, land protected by vetiver hedges produced the highest grain yield, and the lowest runoff and soil loss compared with land protected by other soil conservation measures. Similarly, cassava yield was greatly improved and soil loss was much reduced under the vetiver hedge system in Colombia. In Australia, vetiver grass was found to be salt-tolerant and could be established on a highly alkaline and sodic soil. Vetiver hedges are shown to be superior to other vegetative barriers in stablising steep slopes in rubber and oil palm plantations in Malaysia. Other uses in Malaysia include the stabilisation of road embankments, fish pond and irrigation channel embankments, tin mine rehabilitation and mulch for tree crops. Other applications elsewhere include filter strip and weed barriers. Potential applications of vetiver hedges in Queensland and other tropical and subtropical regions of Australia are discussed.

AB  - Plant, spider, beetle, and ground beetle communities were studied in different agrolandscape biotopes (a wheat field, a field margin, and a forest belt) of Krasnodar Territory. In these biotopes, borders between plant communities were distinct. On the contrary, arthropod communities were not usually confined to the certain biotopes. The high degree of mobility of arthropod species resulted in a decrease in their association with the biotope. Representatives of some species (especially, beetles) were revealed in all the biotopes. In relation to season and some other factors, they frequently concentrated in different biotopes. Analysis of arthropod assemblages only within a single biotope gives us a rather impoverished knowledge of the whole population. It is necessary to study these assemblages not only within the basic biotope, but also in adjacent ones.

AB  - This research contrasts the financial profitability of different agroforestry practices in community-based buffer zone management of Madhupur National Park (MNP), Bangladesh. This park is the second largest in Bangladesh and subjected to enormous anthropogenic pressure and land rights-related conflicts. This paper reports the different agroforestry practices of villagers in different modules of the buffer zone of MNP, identified by a participatory research approach. It then assesses the profitability of each module on the basis of cost–benefit analysis, net present value, internal rate of return, and annualized income. Results indicate three agroforestry systems were being practised in the buffer zone by the participants: agro-silviculture, agro-silvo-horticulture, and combined woodlot and agroforestry. Among these modules, agro-silvo-horticulture was the most profitable, followed by agro-silviculture then combined woodlot and agroforestry. We recognize that not all of the participants can practise intensive agroforestry; our results suggest that the community-based buffer zone management strategy for MNP would benefit from prioritizing agroforestry practices where possible. This will lead to more successful buffer zone management for the conservation of natural forests while supporting the development of local resource-dependent communities.

AB  - Advances in precision farming technologies have facilitated controlled application of agrochemicals and documentation procedures to follow environmental regulations. This paper details evaluation of a commercial variable rate (VR) controller for preventing aldicarb applications in the buffer zones around potable water wells of citrus groves. The controller was coupled to two common drive mechanisms, a ground-driven electric clutch-engaged (GDEC) and pulse-width-modulation motor-driven (PWMM). The evaluation involved determination of dynamic performance of the VR application system through quantification of reaction times and rate transition distances and determination of appropriate “look-ahead” times for each of the drive mechanisms. Without a look-ahead (zero) setting, the mean midpoint reaction distances were about 1.8 and 3.6 m for the GDEC and PWMM mechanisms, respectively, at 7.0-km/h ground speed. For the GDEC, a look-ahead time of 1 s gave the mean midpoint reaction distances of -0.06 and 0.04 m during step-up and step-down of the rate, respectively. For PWMM, the best look-ahead times were 1 and 2 s during step-up and step-down of the rate, respectively. However, since the prototype unit could not accommodate two look-ahead times, the compromise look-ahead time for both step-up and -down was 2 s. Validation in the actual buffer zone showed that, at 95% confidence level, the buffer zone should be increased by 2.5 or 3.3 m in commercial applications using GDEC or PWMM systems, respectively.

AB  - The spatial variation of soil test P (STP) in grassland soils is becoming important because of the use of STP as a basis for policies such as the recently EU-introduced Nitrate Directive. This research investigates the spatial variation of soil P in grazed grassland plots with a long-term (38 y) experiment. A total of 326 soil samples (including 14 samples from an adjacent grass-wood buffer zone) were collected based on a 10 x 10 m² grid system. The samples were measured for STP and other nutrients. The results were analyzed using conventional statistics, geostatistics, and a geographic information system (GIS).Soil test P concentrations followed a lognormal distribution, with a median of 5.30 mg L⁻¹ and a geometric mean of 5.35 mg L⁻¹. Statistically significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation between STP and pH was found. Spatial clusters and spatial outliers were detected using the local Moran's I index (a local indicator of spatial association) and were mapped using GIS. An obvious low-value spatial-cluster area was observed on the plots that received zero-P fertilizer application from 1968 to 1998 and a large high-value spatial-cluster area was found on the relatively high-P fertilizer application plots (15 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹). The local Moran's I index was also effective in detecting spatial outliers, especially at locations close to spatial-cluster areas. To obtain a reliable and stable spatial structure, semivariogram of soil-P data was produced after elimination of spatial outliers. A spherical model with a nugget effect was chosen to fit the experimental semivariogram. The spatial-distribution map of soil P was produced using the kriging interpolation method. The interpolated distribution map was dominated by medium STP values, ranging from 3 mg to 8 mg L⁻¹. An evidently low-P-value area was present in the upper side of the study area, as zero or short-term P fertilizer was applied on the plots. Meanwhile, high-P-value area was located mainly on the plots receiving 15 kg P ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (for 38 y) as these plots accumulated excess P after a long-term P-fertilizer spreading. The high- or low-value patterns were in line with the spatial clusters. Geostatistics, combined with GIS and the local spatial autocorrelation index, provides a useful tool for analyzing the spatial variation in soil nutrients.

AB  - The Bosque River Watershed in Texas is facing a suite of water quality issues including excess sediment, nutrient, and bacteria. The sources of the pollutants are improperly managed cropland and grazing land, dairy manure application, and effluent discharge from wastewater treatment facilities. Several best management practices (BMPs) have been proposed for pollution reduction and watershed protection. The overall objectives of this study were to demonstrate a modeling approach using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate various BMPs and assess their long-term impacts on sediment and nutrient loads at different spatial levels. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for long-term annual and monthly flows at Valley Mills and for monthly sediment, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) at Hico and Valley Mills monitoring locations. The BMPs including streambank stabilization, gully plugs, recharge structures, conservation tillage, terraces, contour farming, manure incorporation, filter strips, and PL-566 reservoirs were simulated in the watershed areas that met the respective practice's specific criteria for implementation. These BMPs were represented in the pre- and post-conditions by modifying one or more channel parameters (channel cover, erodibility, Manning's n), curve number (CN), support practice factor (P-factor), filter strip width, and tillage parameters (mixing efficiency, mixing depth). The BMPs were simulated individually and the resulting Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), subwatershed, and watershed level impacts were quantified for each BMP. Sensitivity of model output values to input parameters used to represent the BMPs was also evaluated. Implementing individual BMPs reduced sediment loads from 3% to 37% and TN loads from 1% to 24% at the watershed outlet; however, the changes in TP loads ranged from 3% increase to 30% decrease. Higher reductions were simulated at the subwatershed and HRU levels. Among the parameters analyzed for sensitivity, P-factor and CN were most sensitive followed by Manning's n. The TN and TP outputs were not sensitive to channel cover. This study showed that the SWAT modeling approach could be used to simulate and assess the effectiveness of agricultural best management practices.

To realize this, Barber's pitfall traps were used. It was shown that adults of Carabidae were significantly abundant on arable field. But, in case of field margin much higher level of species diversity of this beneficial group was recorded. Higher number of species recognized in both biotopes indicates possibility of ground beetles for migration from boundary to wheat field. Thus, they can act as effective agents of biocontrol

AB  - Alternative land management practices such as conservation or no-tillage, contour farming, terraces, and buffer strips are increasingly used to reduce nonpoint source and water pollution resulting from agricultural activities. Models are useful tools to investigate effects of such management practice alternatives on the watershed level. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sensitivity of such models to parameters used to represent these conservation practices. Knowledge about the sensitivity to these parameters would help models better simulate the effects of land management. Hence, this paper presents in the first step a sensitivity analysis for conservation management parameters (specifically tillage depth, mechanical soil mixing efficiency, biological soil mixing efficiency, curve number, Manning's roughness coefficient for overland flow, USLE support practice factor, and filter strip width) in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). With this analysis we aimed to improve model parameterisation and calibration efficiency. In contrast to less sensitive parameters such as tillage depth and mixing efficiency we parameterised sensitive parameters such as curve number values in detail. In the second step the analysis consisted of varying management practices (conventional tillage, conservation tillage, and no-tillage) for different crops (spring barley, winter barley, and sugar beet) and varying operation dates. Results showed that the model is very sensitive to applied crop rotations and in some cases even to small variations of management practices. But the different settings do not have the same sensitivity. Duration of vegetation period and soil cover over time was most sensitive followed by soil cover characteristics of applied crops.

AB  - The aim of the thesis is to find a model for the management of forested buffer zones of nature reserves that would minimize the requirements for state financing through an economic motivation of inhabitants for protection and sustainable development of the area. The model was developed and implemented in the National Forest Priority Area Adaba-Dodola, which serves as a buffer zone for the Bale Mountains National Park in the South-Eastern Highland of Ethiopia. The strategy is based on integration of forestry activities with rural development of the region. The following activities are recommended: sustainably balancing the demand for wood products with the annual increment, regulating forest utilization by the population through licensing, protection of forest regeneration against cattle browsing, sharing of responsibilities for forest management between the communities and the forest administration, benefit sharing accrued from forest utilization, support of private afforestations on non-forest land and establishment of private nurseries.

AB  - Vegetative buffer zones (BZs) between fields and watercourses are one way to minimize phosphorus (P) losses from fields to surface runoff and thus decrease eutrophication and blue-green algal blooms in lakes and coastal waters. A 6-plot experimental field was established in clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in SW Finland in 1991 to study long-term changes in functioning of BZs and their retention capacity for total solids (TS), total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and particulate P (PP) in different seasons. The steep slope in lower sections of four plots (18m wide×70m long) was planted with 10-m-wide mowed grass buffer zones (GBZ) or unmowed vegetated buffer zones (VBZ) growing natural herbage and shrubs. Surface runoff water samples from the GBZ and VBZ plots were compared to samples from plots cultivated without a buffer (NBZ). The source field area in all plots and the steep slope (12-18%) on the NBZ were ploughed in autumn, and sown with barley (Hordeum vulgare) or oats (Avena sativa) in spring (conventional tillage, 1991-2001), sown with grass and grazed (72-234 cow grazing days ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; 2003-2005) and direct drilled without tillage (2006-2008). Surface soil samples (0-2cm) were taken from the BZs in autumn and spring to evaluate the level of plant-available P (P Ac) extracted with 0.5M NH₄-acetate-0.5M acetic acid at pH 4.65. The BZs were most effective at decreasing TS, TP and PP with conventional tillage, less so with direct drilling and least effective with grazing. In a conventionally tilled field, the TS and TP removal efficiencies were over 50% and 27-36%, respectively, for the BZs as compared to the NBZ. In the VBZ plots, the DRP load was, however, 60% greater than in the NBZ or GBZ plots. In direct drilling, the surface runoff losses were smaller than in conventionally tilled NBZ plots. The lowest losses of TS, TP and PP were found during grazing for all plots, but with grazing the DRP load, 0.3-0.4kgha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, was higher than during grain growing in all treatments. The GBZ and VBZ were effective in retaining P in summer and autumn, whereas in spring their retention capacity was decreased. The reason for high DRP losses in spring was the high P Ac in surface soil and frozen broken plant tissues in the VBZ and the grazed source field. Mowing and removing of swathe from the GBZ decreased the DRP losses.

AB  - The age and size structure, length and weight growth of the introduced fish species Lepomis gibbosus L. was studied. The study area included four small artificial lakes, part of lake's system  - adaptive ponds, that serve as a buffer zone between the oil refinery Plama - city Pleven and the River Vit - North Bulgaria. Four age groups were observed (1+ to 4+). Small-sized fish dominated, standard size of 46 to 55 mm comprised 38% of the entire stock. The relationship between standard length - SL and scale radius (R) was: SL = 0.1253R+1.124; TL = 0.1522R+2.3048 for total length respectively. The maximum-sized fish (SL) that was observed was 92mm. Von Bertalanffy length grow curve is presented by the follow equation: SLt = 95[1-e-0.32/t-0.05/]. Weight-length relationship for pumpkinseed population is expressed by the equation: W = 0.0245SL3.187. Compared with other European pumpkinseed populations, the current stock was characterized by lower annual weight and length growth, simple age structure and domination of fish with relatively low sizes.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to investigate P retention in six wetland buffer zone areas (BZAs) in south-central Finland. During the adding period, the lower P concentration in outflow than inflow water indicated that all BZAs were able to retain P. The P retention by BZAs appeared to depend on both hydrological conditions during the adding period and soil P retention properties. P sorption properties in the humus layer varied considerably. P was more efficiently adsorbed in the surface peat layer than in the subsurface peat. Results indicated that correctly designed and dimensioned BZAs are efficient in reducing P load from managed forest areas.

AB  - The effects of timber harvesting on stream water quality and efficiency of alternate streamside management zones were evaluated in Pockwock Lake and Five Mile Lake watersheds in central Nova Scotia, Canada. The streamside management zone (SMZ) included a 20 m no cut, 20 m select cut and a 30 m select cut buffer strips along the stream. Water quality of eight streams, six in harvested and two in not-harvested watersheds were monitored for two years before and two years after the harvesting of timber. Nonparametric statistical tests on stream water quality showed that there was significant change in the concentration of potassium in six streams, manganese in five streams, zinc in two streams and total nitrogen in one stream after timber harvesting. There was no significant change in the quality of water in two streams used as control sites in the neighboring watersheds of similar size and hydrological characteristics. The results show that forest management practices were most favorable in streams maintained with 30 m select cut followed by 20 m no cut and 20 m select cut SMZ. The streamside zone width and treatment of select cut or no cut in the zone played an important role in filtering or retaining the minerals in surface water runoff. In buffer zones of similar width, the buffer zone with no cut or forested buffer was relatively more effective at protecting stream water quality than select cut SMZ. The vegetation in the zone may have decreased the flow velocity and increased residence time and thus increased filtration and retention of minerals in the riparian soil.

AB  - In this paper the suitability of a buffer strip to reduce nitrate concentrations in the upper groundwater was tested for a sandy arable soil in The Netherlands during two consecutive leaching seasons. The bufferstrip was a 3.5 m wide unfertilised grass strip adjacent to a ditch on an arable field. In total 24 groundwater wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the ditch to determine Cl, NO₃ and δ¹⁵N concentrations. Piezometers were installed to assess the groundwater flow, which was in the direction of the ditch with small downward leakage across a peat layer at about 3 m depth. Nitrogen was dominantly present as nitrate (NO₃). The NO₃-N concentrations under the bufferstrip were significantly lower than under the adjacent arable field. The lower concentrations were due to dilution, uptake by grass and denitrification. Nitrate was actively removed in the bufferstrip, since the Cl/NO₃ ratios were higher in the bufferstrip than in the remainder of the field. Furthermore, δ¹⁵N data indicated that denitrification occurred in the groundwater and increased with decreasing distance to the ditch. NO₃-N loads to the ditch were estimated at 8.5 kg ha-¹yr-¹, which is relatively low for this area. We can, however, not determine whether these relatively low NO₃-N loads were causally related to the reduced NO₃-N concentrations in the bufferstrip. Nevertheless, the results of the present study are promising and justify additional research on the efficiency of bufferstrips to reduce NO₃ concentrations in shallow groundwater, and subsequently reduce NO₃ loading of surface water, under Dutch conditions.

AB  - Chronically nitrate-loaded riparian buffer zones show high N₂O emissions. Often, a large part of the N₂O is emitted from small surface areas, resulting in high spatial variability in these buffer zones. These small surface areas with high N₂O emissions (hotspots) need to be investigated to generate knowledge on the factors governing N₂O emissions. In this study the N₂O emission variability was investigated at different spatial scales. Therefore N₂O emissions from three 32 m² grids were determined in summer and winter. Spatial variation and total emission were determined on three different scales (0.3 m², 0.018 m² and 0.0013 m²) at plots with different levels of N₂O emissions. Spatial variation was high at all scales determined and highest at the smallest scale. To test possible factors inducing small scale hotspots, soil samples were collected for slurry incubation to determine responses to increased electron donor/acceptor availability. Acetate addition did increase N₂O production, but nitrate addition failed to increase total denitrification or net N₂O production. N₂O production was similar in all soil slurries, independent of their origin from high or low emission soils, indicating that environmental conditions (including physical factors like gas diffusion) rather than microbial community composition governed N₂O emission rates.

AB  - The compatibility of natural resource use by people and mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) within the Parc National des Volcans was studied. The distribution of gorillas was modelled using a Maximum Entropy algorithm. Biophysical predictor variables were trained with daily GPS locations of gorillas during 2006. Elevation, as a climate surrogate, was the best predictor (58%) of the occurrence of gorillas. The mid-altitudes (2500-3500 m a.s.l.) contained the bulk of the gorilla groups. Incoming solar radiation, as proxy for comfortable nesting sites, was the second best predictor (17%). Vegetation types, as foliage provider, (13%) and slope steepness for providing security (12%) were contributing predictors. The modelled and actual gorilla distributions were together overlaid with people's resource use in the park. Both people and gorillas were congregated in the areas identified as most suitable for gorillas. However, within these areas spatial segregation was found between human natural resource-users and gorillas. Therefore, the number of gorillas is likely to be limited by the human natural resource use within the park. A perimeter fence, the introduction of community-based natural resource management, and a buffer zone are discussed as short-, medium- and long-term mitigation measures.

AB  - The quality of the water of Laguna de Bay is been threatened by industrial and domestic activities in its western bay and agricultural activities in its eastern bay contribute to nutrient and pesticide discharges affecting the lake. A pesticide monitoring study of surface water of the Lucban River and Salasad Creek in the Pagsanjan-Lumban watershed of Laguna de Bay showed that some of the pesticides used by farmers to protect their crops from pests are being transported in drainage water. In the Lucban River, malathion was detected throughout the monitoring period from 2007 to 2009 at concentrations ranging from 0.005μg/L to 3.3μg/L. The detections of pesticides corresponded with times of pesticide application in the field. Profenofos was detected at concentrations of 0.5–15.3μg/L during 2008–2009 in water of Salasad Creek. The concentrations exceeded the (WHO, 2006) recommended level of 0.1μg/L for single pesticide in drinking water. There was no direct relationship between total suspended sediments and concentration of pesticides present in the surface water of Lucban River and Salasad Creek. Malathion and profenofos were transported from site of application to water bodies predominantly (>60%) in the soluble (<1.2μm) phase. Although the concentration of malathion increased in January with increasing rainfall the trend was not consistent throughout the study period. Measures to mitigate the off-site movement of malathion and profenofos to surface water need to be implemented to protect the quality of the eastern bay of the lake. This study shows that pesticide applications to crops very close to the water bodies, a common practice in the Philippines, is responsible for contamination of the creek and river, and a first step in reducing contamination would be improve practices in the areas closest to the drainage system, perhaps by introducing a narrow (3–5m) riparian buffer zone in which spraying in not permitted. However, this strategy would have limited effectiveness for compounds that move predominantly in a soluble phase.

AB  - Organic matter plays several important roles in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including the mobilization and transport of nutrients and pollutants. Cropping, tillage practices and vegetative buffer strip installation affect losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). While many studies show reductions in pollutant export from agroecosystems where vegetative buffers have been implemented, buffer strips may be a source of DOC and contribute to surface water pollution. Using a paired-watershed approach, the objectives of this study were to determine the effect of grass and agroforestry buffers on runoff and DOC loss, compare runoff and DOC losses between the growing and fallow seasons, and investigate crop effects on runoff and DOC losses. The study design consisted of three small agricultural Watersheds in a no-till, maize-soybean rotation located in the claypan region of northeast Missouri, USA; one watershed was planted with grass buffer strips, one with agroforestry buffer strips, and one unaltered watershed served as the control. Runoff and DOC loss were measured during a six-year calibration period (1991-1997) prior to buffer installation and for a nine-year treatment period (1997-2006). The grass buffer strips significantly decreased runoff by 8.4% (p =0.015) during the treatment period while the agroforestry buffer system exhibited no significant change in runoff (p =0.207). Loss of DOC was not significantly affected by grass or agroforestry buffer installation (p =0.535 and p =0.246, respectively). Additionally, no significant difference in runoff or DOC loss was found between crops (maize and soybean) or between seasons (growing and fallow). Overall, this study indicates that grass buffer systems are effective at reducing runoff and that DOC contamination of surface waters is not exacerbated by either type of vegetative buffer strip.

AB  - Being able to identify riparian sites that function better for nitrate removal from groundwater is critical to using efficiently the riparian zones for water quality management. For this purpose, managers need a method that is quick, inexpensive, and accurate enough to enable effective management decisions. This study assesses the precision and accuracy of a simple method using three ground water wells and one measurement date for determining nitrate removal characteristics of riparian buffer zones. The method is a scaled-down version of a complex field research method that consists of a large network of wells and piezometers monitored monthly for over two years. Results using the simplified method were compared to those from the reference research method on a date-by-date basis on eight sites covering a wide range of hydrogeomorphic settings. The accuracy of the three-well, 1 day measurement method was relatively good for assessing nitrate concentration depletion across riparian zones, but poor for assessing the distance necessary to achieve a 90% nitrate removal and for estimating water and nitrate fluxes compared to the reference method. The simplified three-well method provides relatively better estimates of water and nitrate fluxes on sites where ground-water flow is parallel to the water table through homogeneous aquifer material, but such conditions may not be geographically widespread. Despite limited overall accuracy, some parameters that are estimated using the simplified method may be useful to water resource managers. Nitrate depletion information may be used to assess the adequacy of existing buffers to achieve nitrate concentration goals for runoff. Estimates of field nitrate runoff and buffer removal fluxes may be adequate for prioritizing management toward sites where riparian buffers are likely to have greater impact on stream water quality.

AB  - Nitrous oxide emissions from soils are known to be variable in both space and time. To better understand this variability, this study was conducted to (i) evaluate the landscape-scale patterns and seasonal variations in N₂O emissions, (ii) determine the contribution of the different environmental factors (texture and organic matter content of the soil, crop management, mineral nitrogen content, and fertilizer application) on the estimation of N₂O emissions at the field scale. We used static chamber and gas chromatography methods to measure N₂O emissions in the Orgeval sub-basin (Seine Basin, France), in representative sites selected on the basis of land use: a continuum from an agricultural plateau to the riparian buffer, grassland and a forest site. A consistent landscape-scale pattern of N₂O emissions was observed with higher emissions in the footslope (annual flux of 4.0±2.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) than in the slope positions (1.1±0.6 and 1.9±1.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) or the shoulder positions (1.1±0.5kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Nitrous oxide emissions from the riparian buffer were significant with an annual budget of 0.5±0.4kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, while extrapolated emissions from forest and grassland were 0.6±0.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and 0.7±0.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, respectively. Topography plays a role mainly in its relation with hydrological processes which, in turn, regulate the soil factors (mainly water-filled pore space) controlling N₂O emissions at the microscale level. The seasonal fluctuations of N₂O emissions were influenced by precipitations (pulses after large rainfall events following fertilization) and thawing.

AB  - O reconhecimento jurídico da Zona de Amortecimento – ZA de unidades deconservação tem sido considerado o mais forte instrumento para impedir que atividades impactantessobre os ecossistemas sejam desenvolvidas junto às áreas protegidas. Com o objetivo de analisar ademanda de informação de processos, a natureza das atividades cujo licenciamento foi solicitadoe a eficácia das políticas públicas na aplicação da legislação vigente, consultamos 155 processosque tratavam de empreendimentos ao redor da Estação Ecológica de Assis, SP, tomando comobase o raio de 10 km a partir do perímetro da UC, estabelecido pela Resolução CONAMA nº 13/90.No período considerado (1990-2006), que antecedeu a delimitação da ZA e estabelecimentode suas normas em Plano de Manejo, a demanda potencial de análise de pedidos de licença ouautorização ambiental foi, em média, de 10 processos por ano, o que corresponde a um processopara cada 6.000 ha por ano, relacionados, em sua maioria, com a conversão do uso da terra, depecuária para agricultura, o que requer o corte de árvores isoladas e a recuperação de áreas depreservação permanente. Uma vez que apenas 8% dos processos foram encaminhados ao órgãogestor, a demanda real foi inferior a um décimo da demanda potencial. Nos raros casos em queo órgão gestor foi ouvido, o parecer contrário do gestor nem sempre foi suficiente para impediro licenciamento solicitado. Com base no estudo de caso da Estação Ecológica de Assis, concluiu-se quea legislação correlata ao licenciamento ambiental ao redor de unidades de conservação não foi aplicadade modo a impedir a instalação de atividades potencialmente impactantes aos ecossistemas naturais.Legal recognition of the buffer zone of protected areas has been considered themost powerful tool to prevent environmental impacts to the natural ecosystems coming from thesurrounding areas. In order to analyze the demand for process analysis, the nature of the activitieswhose license has been requested and effectiveness of public policies in the implementation ofexisting legislation, we analyzed 155 cases that dealt with projects around the Assis EcologicalStation, SP, based on the 10 km radius from the perimeter of the protected area established byCONAMA Resolution No. 13/90. During the analyzed period (1990-2006), which precededthe definition of the buffer zone and its rules in the management plan, the potential demand forexamining applications for the environmental license was, on an average, 10 cases per year, whichcorresponds to a process for every 6,000 ha per year, mostly related to the conversion of land usefrom pasture to agriculture, which requires the cutting of individual trees and recovery of riparianforests. Since the opinion of the managing institution (Forestry Institute) was requested in only 8%of cases, the actual demand was less than a tenth of the potential demand. In the rare cases wherethe Forestry Institute was listened, it was not always enough to prevent the licensing approval.Based on the case study of Assis Ecological Station, we concluded that the accomplishmentof the existing laws has not been adequate to ensure the effectiveness of the buffer zone.

AB  - Ethnobotanical survey was conducted in 101 randomly selected home gardens of Phong My commune, central Vietnam, situated in the buffer-zone of Natural Reserve. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires and direct observation. Sixty-seven species belonging to 35 families were identified to be used for various purposes. For each species the botanical and vernacular names, plant parts used and main purposes of use are given. The major use categories reported for plant species were food (86%), medicine (32%) and firewood (32%), however, seventy-seven percent of all inventoried plants have multiple uses. The species Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., Citrus grandis Osbeck, Citrus reticulata Blanco, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. and Musa spp. were identified as the main sources of plant foods consumed within the households. Statistical analyses indicated by Shannon-Wiener and Margalef indices have shown that local species diversity and richness is affected by home garden size. On the contrary, no relationship between diversity and home garden age was found. On the basis of a cluster analysis of plant species diversity, five home garden types were differentiated. In comparison to previously reported studies on tropical home gardens, the diversity in Phong My is lower, probably due to market-oriented strategy. Nevertheless, based on the results achieved, we can conclude that useful plants cultivated in local home gardens provide valuable foods complementing daily diet and subsequently contributing to socioeconomic status of the households.

AB  - The potential impact of nectar availability for biological pest control is of increasing relevance due to the disappearance of non-crop plants in intensified agricultural landscapes. However, little is known about how floral resources and their spatial distribution in and around crop fields influence cereal aphid parasitoid (Hymenoptera, Aphidiidae) survival and population dynamics. Cereal aphid parasitoids may be less dependent on flowers as they can use honeydew from their aphid hosts as an alternative food resource. However, honeydew appears to be less suitable as a food source for parasitoids when compared to nectar. Here the effects of flower distribution (nectar), aphid abundance (honeydew quantity) and honeydew quality on parasitoid life history parameters were explored using a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model. In addition, effects of the availability of floral resources in field margins on parasitism levels in winter wheat were investigated in a field study. In the simulation study three flower distributions were compared: (i) flowers restricted to the field margin (most common in agricultural landscapes) or (ii) flowers in strips within the crop, and (iii) random flower distribution in the field. Simulations suggest that nectar feeding increases parasitoid longevity and parasitism at low aphid densities, but only in fields with randomly distributed flowers. In contrast, the spatial distribution of flowers did not affect the parasitoid longevity and parasitism rate at high aphid densities, where parasitoid feeding was restricted to the abundant honeydew resources. In simulations, parasitoid survival and the number of aphids parasitized were also affected by the nutritional quality of the honeydew, with low quality honeydew having a less positive effect on parasitoid longevity and parasitism rate. The field study did not indicate evidence of a significant relationship between flower cover in field margins and parasitism rates in wheat near the margins. This finding is compatible with results from simulations and suggests that honeydew feeding is more prevalent in cereal aphid parasitoids than nectar feeding. In conclusion, nectar may be an important factor for the potential biocontrol success of cereal aphid parasitoids, but most likely only at low aphid densities and especially when flowers are broadly distributed in the field.

AB  - Biotransformation studies of atrazine, metolachlor and evolution of their metabolites were carried out in soils and subsoils of Northern Greece. Trace atrazine, its metabolites and metolachlor residues were detected in field soil samples 1year after their application. The biotransformation rates of atrazine were higher in soils and subsoils of field previously exposed to atrazine (maize field sites) than in respective layers of the field margin. The DT₅₀ values of atrazine ranged from 5 to 18d in the surface layers of the adapted soils. DT₅₀ values of atrazine increased as the soil depth increased reaching the value of 43d in the 80–110cm depth layer of adapted soils. Metolachlor degraded at slower rates than atrazine in surface soils, subsoils of field and field margins with the respective DT₅₀ values ranging from 56 to 72d in surface soils and from 165 to 186d in subsoils. Hydroxyatrazine was the most frequently detected metabolite of atrazine. The maximum concentrations of metolachlor-OXA and metolachlor-ESA were detected in the soil layers of 20–40cm depth after 90d of incubation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of soil Phospholipid Fatty Acids (PLFAs), fungal/bacterial and Gram-negative/Gram-positive ratios of the PLFA profiles revealed that the higher biotransformation rates of atrazine were simultaneously observed with the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria while the respective rates of metolachlor were observed in soil samples with abundance of fungi.

AB  - Conservation of ecological processes and biodiversity may require development of a conservation system consisting of protected "cores" surrounded by "buffer zones" that effectively expand and connect the cores. Nevertheless, residential development near protected areas may threaten de facto protected areas and hinder development of an official conservation system in the United States. We identified potential conservation cores based on existing protected areas, and using a spatially explicit model of housing densities, we quantified how residential development has altered the structural context around cores nationally from 1970 to 2000 and forecasted changes from 2000 to 2030. We found that residential housing development has likely occurred preferentially near some cores, and if encroachment near cores continues at projected rates, the amount of buffer zone will have been reduced by a total of 12% by 2030, with much of this change occurring directly at core edges. Furthermore, development will have reduced the average connectedness (valence) of cores by 6% from 1970 to 2030. Although patterns of encroachment roughly increased west to east, our results painted a more complex picture of the difficulties that would be faced if establishment of an official conservation system was ever attempted. At a minimum, prioritizing future conservation action must consider adjacent land uses, and a key conservation strategy will be to work cooperatively across land-ownership boundaries, particularly for smaller protected areas, which will tend to dominate future conservation activities.

AB  - Danau Sentarum National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia is bordered on three sides by Iban settlements and the forests they manage. The forest management system practiced by an Iban community on the northeastern periphery of the reserve is describe here. Iban agroforestry is based on two principles components: swidden cultivation, which creates a field-secondary forest mosaic and various kinds of preserved and managed forest. Iban hunt within these forests, and the species and numbers of animals they encounter are analysed here with respect to their exploitation of the agroforests and fields. The merits and constraints of this management system are discussed. Based on the data analysed here, this sytem appears to promote some degree of biodiversity conservation and may serve as a partial buffer zone around the nearby wildlife reserve.

AB  - A method for river classification based on water quality assessment (WQA) was introduced using factor analysis (FA) in this paper. Sixty-nine sampling sites and 20 water quality parameters in Taizi River basin were selected for monitoring and analysis. Five factors were determined in FA, denoted as general, hardness, trophic, nitrogen pollution, and physical factors. The total factor scores (TFSs) of the WQA results from all sampling sites were calculated by the eigenvalue and factor score of each factor. The TFSs of 69 sites were interpolated with the measure of inverse distance weighted in the river buffer zone generated by ArcGIS 9.2 software to form a continuous spatial distribution along river channels. All streams were divided into five classes marked “excellent”, “good”, “fair”, “poor”, and “seriously polluted”. The classification result showed that the water quality of Taizi River basin deteriorated gradually from the mountain area to the plain area. Sewage and intensive human activities contributed to the deterioration of water quality since towns and farmland were dotted densely along the river basin.

AB  - An updated ecological risk assessment was conducted to re-evaluate and review the overall risk of pesticide residues to certain aquatic life. The focus was the impact on offsite non-target, freshwater organisms of pesticide operational sprays in British Columbia from 1973 until 2012. The values of risk quotients for pesticides of selected indicator organisms were determined to measure the effect. When compared with organophosphorus, carbamate, and other miscellaneous pesticides, this risk assessment analysis suggests that the historical use of persistent and highly toxic organochlorine pesticides posed, and continue to pose, a deleterious ecological risk. The risk is both short-term acute and long-term sub-acute, chronic toxicity to offsite, non-target aquatic invertebrates and juvenile salmonid fish. Data indicated that these organisms were, and remain, subjected to harmful effects of pesticide residues to varying degrees. Most vulnerable were, and also are, benthic organisms inhabiting bottom sediments. This substrate is the natural sink for persistent pesticide residues, predominantly organochlorine pesticides from historical use, as well as dioxins, furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from wood preservatives, and other sources. Environment Canada's main aquatic protection strategy was a 10 metre no-treatment buffer zone, augmented with an additional appropriate setback along shorelines of fishery and wildlife resource-sensitive water bodies. This study discusses why this guideline was necessary, useful and effective, but was only partially successful. The physical-chemical properties of pesticide residues, from either an individual compound or different compounds in combination, also influence the nature of biological impacts on non-target, aquatic organisms. Few studies have been conducted in British Columbia aquatic environments to investigate the significance of this aspect.

AB  - Forest stand stability to strong winds such as hurricanes has been found to be associated with a number of forest, soil and topography factors. In this study, through applying geographic information system (GIS) and logit regression, we assessed effects of forest characteristics and site conditions on pattern, severity and probability of Hurricane Katrina disturbance to forests in the Lower Pearl River Valley, USA. The factors included forest type, forest coverage, stand density, soil great group, elevation, slope, aspect, and stream buffer zone. Results showed that Hurricane Katrina damaged 60% of the total forested land in the region. The distribution and intensity of the hurricane disturbance varied across the landscape, with the bottomland hardwood forests on river floodplains most severely affected. All these factors had a variety of effects on vulnerability of the forests to the hurricane disturbance and thereby spatial patterns of the disturbance. Soil groups and stand factors including forest types, forest coverage and stand density contributed to 85% of accuracy in modeling the probability of the hurricane disturbance to forests in this region. Besides assessment of Katrina's damage, this study elucidates the great usefulness of remote sensing and GIS techniques combined with statistics modeling in assessment of large-scale risks of hurricane damage to coastal forests.

AB  - Vegetated buffer strips have been recognized as an important element in overall agro-ecosystem management to reduce the delivery of non-point source pollutants from agricultural land to inland water systems. A buffer strip experiment consisting of two tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Casuarina cunninghamiana) with two planting densities and a pasture treatment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of NO₃–N removal from a cattle feedlot effluent disposal area at Tullimba near Armidale, NSW Australia. Different management methods were applied for the buffers where grass and weeds were mowed 2–3 times during the second and third years and were not managed during the rest experimental years for the tree buffer, while grass was harvested 1–3 times per year for the pasture buffer. The differences between tree species and planting density significantly affected tree growth, but the growth difference did not significantly affect their capacities to reduce NO₃–N in soil surface runoff and groundwater. On average for all the tree and pasture treatments, the buffer strips reduced NO₃–N concentration by 8.5%, 14.7% and 14.4% for the surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater respectively. The tree and pasture buffer strips were not significantly different in NO₃–N reduction for both shallow and deep groundwater while the pasture buffer strips reduced significantly more NO₃–N concentration in surface runoff than the tree buffer strips. Both buffer strips reduced more than 50% of surface runoff volume indicating that both the tree and pasture buffer strips were efficient at removing water and nutrients, mostly through a significant reduction in soil surface runoff volume.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes nitrification, denitrification and ammonia (NH₃) volatilization. SPOT-5 and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of R ² =0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes nitrification, denitrification and ammonia (NH₃) volatilization. SPOT-5 and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of R ² =0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.

AB  - Vigilance is used to detect predators and monitor rivals. We studied red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) in Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, China, to examine changes in the allocation of time to vigilance as a function of flock size in areas with different levels of human disturbance. There was low level of human activity in the core area of the reserve whereas more human activity occurred in the buffer zone. Vigilance decreased linearly with flock size but to significantly different extent in the two areas, with a more pronounced decrease in the more disturbed area. In smaller crane flocks, vigilance was higher in the more disturbed area. Vigilance also varied in a non-linear fashion with flock size first decreasing and then increasing in larger flocks. Increase in vigilance in larger flocks was accompanied by an increase in fighting suggesting that vigilance in large flocks was aimed partly at monitoring rivals. The effect of human disturbance on vigilance suggests that less time is available for foraging in more disturbed areas. Nevertheless, moving to less disturbed areas may not be an option for the cranes given the increase in vigilance that would probably occur in areas with more cranes.

AB  - We examined the distribution and foraging behaviour of northern waterthrushes (Seiurus noveboracensis) in recently harvested and intact landscapes of Newfoundland. Data were collected along six 1-km segments of stream and adjoining upland habitat resulting in four treatments (harvested or intact, upland or stream) with three replicates each. Although known as a riparian specialist, we found waterthrush territories equally distributed across intact upland and riparian habitats. However, few waterthrushes occupied harvested uplands, while large numbers packed into riparian buffer strips adjacent to these 5- to 10-year-old postharvest clearcuts. Arthropod abundance and biomass were highly variable between years and across the four treatments, generating significant year × treatment interaction effects. Riparian habitat (in both intact and harvested areas) had consistently greater numbers of arthropod prey and more biomass than either upland habitat type. Northern waterthrushes foraging in riparian habitat adjacent to harvested uplands had lower attack rates and more frequent long flights than waterthrushes foraging in the intact treatment types. Prolonged packing of individuals into riparian buffer strips, and apparent adverse affects on waterthrush foraging efficiency, raise concerns about the effectiveness of buffer strips for sustaining viable populations of terrestrial riparian habitat specialists.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) of surface waters is a significant issue in agricultural lands, and best management practices (BMPs) are often used to reduce these impacts. Since the effectiveness of a BMP depends on a large number of widely varying factors, it is important to continue to develop BMPs in order to provide designers with more tools to use to maximize NPS removal. The contour weep berm is a new structural BMP constructed out of earth and subsequently vegetated. It is a linear BMP that is used in combination with a down-gradient vegetated filter strip or forested riparian buffer. Preliminary field evaluations of the contour weep berm indicate it is effective at reducing runoff volumes and peaks, promoting infiltration, and reducing sediment concentrations in runoff. Procedures for designing a contour weep berm are presented along with a design example. Linear BMPs, such as the contour weep berm, can provide producers with another means of effectively controlling NPS.

AB  - 1. The main objectives of our study were (i) to establish the relative impact of pressures that degrade ecological status, especially those caused by agriculture and urbanisation, (ii) to identify regional patterns in these pressure-impact relationships and (iii) to evaluate the relative weight of the pressures acting at the basin and riparian corridor scales, and the possible buffering effect of riparian areas. 2. We developed large-scale models linking invertebrate indices of ecological quality to river basin and riparian land cover in France, Slovakia, Estonia and U.K. Invertebrate indices, transformed to ecological quality ratios (EQR), were taken from national monitoring networks. We based the models on partial least squares (PLS) regressions at national and a hydro-ecoregion (HER) scales. The HERs provided a framework for grouping data in terms of natural river features and human activities. 3. The different national methods provided consistent results that indicated the hierarchy of pressures impacting river invertebrates at the European scale. Artificial land cover (e.g. urban and industrial sites) in the river basin represented the pressure with the most negative impact on invertebrate indices, in all countries and regions. 4. The impact of agricultural land cover was more variable. Arable land had a smaller impact than urban areas and was insignificant in some models. The proportion of arable land in the river basin appeared to be a weak predictor of agricultural impacts by itself; the type of cultivation and intensity as well as the proximity to the river must be taken into account. 5. At the riparian corridor scale, the negative impact of artificial areas or arable land and the positive effects of forests and pastures were demonstrated in many regions. The protective effect of riparian forests against mixed agricultural and urban pressures was demonstrated in three regions in France. Riparian corridors appear to be manageable areas, and these results strongly support the idea of including their restoration in priority actions for achieving good ecological status.

AB  - The threat of P transport from land applied manure has resulted in water quality concerns. Research was conducted to evaluate gypsum as a soil amendment applied to grass buffer strips for reducing soluble P in surface runoff. A simulated concentrated flow was created in an established tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) pasture. Poultry litter (PL) was applied at a rate of 250 kg N ha-1 to the upper 3.05 m of each plot, while gypsum was applied at rates of 0, 1, 3.2, and 5.6 Mg ha-1to the lower 1.52 m of the plot functioning as a grass buffer strip. Two 30-min runoff events (4 L min-1) were conducted, immediately after PL application and 4 wk later to determined soluble P concentration in the surface water samples. The greatest concentration of soluble P was in the runoff event occurring immediately after the PL application. Gypsum applied to grass buffer strips was effective in reducing soluble P concentrations (32-40%) in surface runoff, while the untreated buffer strip was somewhat effective in reducing soluble P (18%). No significant differences were observed between gypsum rates, suggesting that land managers would achieve the greatest benefit from the lowest application rate (1Mgha-1). In the second runoff event, although concentrations of soluble P in the surface water runoff were greatly reduced, the effect of gypsum had disappeared. Thus, these results show that gypsum is most effective in reducing the initial P losses from PL application when applied to grass buffer strips. The information obtained from this study may be useful in aiding land managers in developing management practices that reduce soluble P loss at the edge of a field.

AB  - Livestock grazing in the Midwestern United States can result in significant levels of runoff sediment and nutrient losses to surface water resources. Some of these contaminants can increase stream eutrophication and are suspected of contributing to hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. This research quantified effects of livestock grazing management practices and vegetative filter strip buffers on runoff depth and mass losses of total solids, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), and ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P) under natural hydrologic conditions. Runoff data were collected from 12 rainfall events during 2001 to 2003 at an Iowa State University research farm in central Iowa, United States. Three vegetative buffers (paddock area:vegetative buffer area ratios of 1:0.2, 1:0.1, and 1:0 no buffer [control]) and three grazing management practices (continuous, rotational, and no grazing [control]) comprised nine treatment combinations (vegetative buffer ratio/grazing management practice) replicated in three 1.35 ha (3.34 ac) plot areas. The total 4.05 ha (10.02 ac) study area also included nine 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) paddocks and 27 vegetative buffer runoff collection units distributed in a randomized complete block design. The study site was established on uneven terrain with a maximum of 15% slopes and consisted of approximately 100% cool-season smooth bromegrass. Average paddock and vegetative buffer plant tiller densities estimated during the 2003 project season were approximately 62 million and 93 million tillers ha−1 (153 million and 230 million tillers ac−1), respectively. Runoff sample collection pipe leakage discovered and corrected during 2001 possibly reduced runoff depth and affected runoff contaminant mass losses data values. Consequently, 2001 runoff analysis results were limited to treatment comparisons within the 2001 season and were not compared with 2002 and 2003 data. Analysis results from 2001 showed no significant differences in average losses of runoff, total solids, NO3-N, and PO4-P among the nine vegetative buffer/grazing practice treatment combinations. Results from 2002 indicated significantly higher losses of runoff and total solids from 1:0 no buffer/rotational grazing and 1:0 no buffer/continuous grazing treatment combination plots, respectively, compared among other 2002 season treatment combinations. The 2003 results showed significantly higher runoff and total solids losses from 1:0 no buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and from 1:0.1 vegetative buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among all 2003 treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. However, the 2003 results indicated effective vegetative buffer performance with significantly lower runoff, total solids, and NO3-N losses from the larger 1:0.2 buffer area compared among the smaller 1:0.1 buffer area and 1:0 no buffer treatment combinations. The 2003 results also indicated a highly significant increase in losses of NO3-N from 1:0.1 buffer/no grazing treatment combination plots compared among other 2003 season treatment combinations and with respective 2002 treatment combinations. Overall results from this study suggest a shift from significantly higher 2002 season plot losses of continuous and rotational grazing treatment combinations to significantly higher 2003 season losses of no grazing treatment combinations. We speculate this shift to significantly higher runoff and contaminant losses from no grazing treatment combination plots during 2003 reflects the variability inherent to a complex and dynamic soil-water environment of livestock grazing areas. However, we also hypothesize the environmental conditions that largely consisted of a dense perennial cool-season grass type, high-relief landscape, and relatively high total rainfall depth may not necessarily include livestock grazing activities.

AB  - This study quantified the effects of a livestock manure-based windrow composting practice with a fly ash composting pad surface and vegetative filter strip (VFS) buffers on losses of runoff, runoff percent of rainfall, total solids, nitrate-nitrogen, ortho-phosphorus (PO₄-P), and total-phosphorus during natural rainfall events. Runoff data from six events were collected during June and July (early season) and August and September (late season) 60-day duration composting periods from 2002 through 2004 at an Iowa State University research farm near Ames, central Iowa, USA. The research site was selected on uneven terrain with average slopes of 5% and 2% on the VFS buffer and composting pad plot areas, respectively. Runoff treatments were comprised of three compost windrows:VFS buffer area ratios that included 1:1, 1:0.5, and 1:0 (no buffer) control. The 1:1 and 1:0.5 area ratios represented a 6.0-m (20-ft) wide x 23-m (75-ft) long fly ash composting pad area compared to VFS buffer areas of equal and one-half size, respectively. All treatments had three replications for a total of nine runoff plots in a randomized complete block design. Results from the study indicate significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) of runoff, runoff percent of rainfall, total solids, nitrate-nitrogen, PO₄-P, and total-phosphorus from the 1:0 control plots compared to the 1:1 and 1:0.5 VFS buffer plots. Results also show the 1:1 and 1:0.5 VFS buffer treatments were not significantly different (p < 0.05) and that average runoff loss reductions from the 1:1 and 1:0.5 VFS buffer plots were 98% and 93%, respectively, compared to the 1:0 control plots. These results reflect the effectiveness of VFS buffers for reducing runoff and contaminant losses from a windrow composting site. Compost nutrient mass balance analysis results indicate 41% and 26% of PO₄-P were lost from the compost windrows during the 2004 early season and late season composting periods, respectively. However, only 0.1% to 0.4% of PO₄-P was lost to runoff from the 1:0 control plots during the respective 2004 early season and late season composting periods. We hypothesize the relatively lower PO₄-P losses in runoff may be attributed to potential chemical and physical effects of the fly ash composting pad material.

AB  - Metolachlor and metribuzin loss in runoff was determined in three soybean tillage systems with and without a 4 by 2 m tall fescue vegetative filter strip. Soil erosion plots were 4 by 22 m with 3% slope. Regression analysis was used to describe herbicide concentration in runoff, and to determine if vegetative filter strips reduced herbicide concentration. Analysis of covariance indicated no difference in concentration of metolachlor or metribuzin in runoff from the three tillage systems within any vegetative filter strip treatment. Metolachlor loss in 1991 was highest from the no-till monocrop without a vegetative filter strip, and it was 65 g ha-1 or approximately 2% of the amount applied. In 1992 and 1993, the no-till doublecrop had a total loss of 120 and 147 g ha-1, respectively, approximately 4% of the amount applied. Similar results were noted with metribuzin, but total loss was as high as 46 g ha-1 or 11% of the amount applied in 1993 from a no-till doublecrop system without a vegetative filter strip. When a vegetative filter strip was present, losses of metribuzin and metolachlor were reduced over 85% in 1993, and totaled 1.2 and 0.5%, respectively, of the amount applied. The vegetative filter strip reduced herbicide and suspended solids from runoff produced by a conventional-till production system to levels equal to or lower than a no-till doublecrop system.

AB  - AIMS: To determine whether poultry litter marker gene LA35 is correlated with pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in run‐off from poultry litter‐amended plots. METHODS AND RESULTS: A rainfall simulator with various vegetative filter strip lengths was employed to evaluate the correlation of a microbial source tracking (MST) marker for poultry feces/litter (the 16S rRNA gene of Brevibacterium sp. LA35 [LA35] measured by quantitative PCR) with pathogens and FIB in run‐off. LA35 was correlated with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. and Bacteroidales levels. Salmonella was present at low concentration in litter, but became undetectable by qPCR in run‐off. Escherichia coli, LA35 and Staph. aureus exhibited mass‐based first flush behaviour in the run‐off. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of LA35 with FIB and pathogens in run‐off from poultry litter‐amended fields suggest comparable transport mechanisms and that LA35 is a useful tracer for harmful bacteria in the environment released from poultry litter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To protect human health, an effective marker for poultry fecal contamination should exhibit similar fate and transport characteristics compared to pathogens. This study is among the first to demonstrate such a relationship in run‐off for a MST marker.

AB  - The influence of natural areas on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) diversity and community composition in Wisconsin potatoes was assessed at local and large spatial scales. To accomplish this, ground beetle communities were sampled in potatoes and grassy field-margin habitats set in landscapes composed of varying amounts of natural area. At a local scale, field-margin habitats supported more, and different, carabid species than potatoes. Large carabids, brachypterous species, species typical of dry habitats and species that feed on seeds were all underrepresented in potatoes compared to field margins. However, the amount of field-margin habitat surrounding potatoes did not affect carabid community structure in the crop. At a larger scale, beetle diversity in potatoes increased and community composition changed with increases in the amount of natural area within 1.5km of the crop. However, this effect was not evident in adjacent field-margin habitats. These results suggest that the amount of natural area surrounding potatoes affects the composition of potential crop colonizers at a large spatial scale but that disturbances currently limit the types of species that colonize potatoes.

AB  - Buffer strips are refuges for a variety of plants providing resources, such as pollen, nectar and seeds, for higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, mammals and birds. Margins can also harbour plant species that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g. Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare, which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be widely adopted as a management tool in its current form.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFSs) are a commonly used conservation measure to remove pollutants from agricultural runoff. The effectiveness of VFSs has been widely studied at the plot scale, yet researchers generally agree that field scale implementations are far less effective. The purpose of this research was to develop a field scale VFS submodel for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A model for the retention of sediments and nutrients in VFSs was developed from experimental observations derived from 22 publications. A runoff retention model was developed from Vegetative Filter Strip MODel (VFSMOD) simulations. This model was adapted to operate at the field scale by considering the effects of flow concentration generally absent from plot scale experiments. Flow concentration through 10 hypothetical VFSs was evaluated using high resolution (2 m) topographical data and multipath flow accumulation. Significant flow concentration was predicted at all sites, on average 10% of the VFS received half of the field runoff. As implemented in SWAT, the VFS model contains two sections, a large section receiving relatively modest flow densities and a smaller section treating more concentrated flow. This field scale model was incorporated into SWAT and verified for proper function. This model enhances the ability of SWAT to evaluate the effectiveness of VFSs at the watershed scale.

AB  - On the dry region of Wonogiri Regency and Pacitan Regency, in the Central Java and East Java Province’s border of Indonesia, there is a potential group of plant which is still disguise from the researcher’s attention. These wild edible tuberous plant, were actually have potential source of carbohydrate as an alternative to rice or corn inside the forest system or agro-forestry system. Their minimum maintenance, adaptability to drought and shading make them a potential plant as the staple food for the local people residing inside or in the forest’s buffer zone. Wild taro (Aracaceae family) existence in the forest system or agro-forestry might increase the economic sustainability of forest. Using a Randomized block design method on the 5 plots sample located on the Northern slope of Wonogiri dry-land, the density and distribution type of wild taro and taro-like plants were surveyed. There were six genus of wild tuberous plant with 12 identified species and several endemic species identified. Xantosoma sp has the highest population, and generally the aroid plants have clumped distribution. Current situation of economical importance of other commodity and relationship with human agricultural activities may vary the distribution of Taro.

AB  - The Willamette Valley of Oregon has extensive areas of poorly drained, commercial grass seed lands. Little is know about the ability of riparian areas in these settings to reduce nitrate in water draining from grass seed fields. We established two study sites with similar soils and hydrology but contrasting riparian vegetation along an intermittent stream that drains perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) fields in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We installed a series of nested piezometers along three transects at each site to examine NO3–N in shallow ground water in grass seed fields and riparian areas. Results showed that a noncultivated riparian zone comprised of grasses and herbaceous vegetation significantly reduced NO3–N concentrations of shallow ground water moving from grass seed fields. Darcy's law–based estimates of shallow ground water flow through riparian zone A/E horizons revealed that this water flowpath could account for only a very small percentage of the streamflow. Even though there is great potential for NO3–N to be reduced as water moves through the noncultivated riparian zone with grass–herbaceous vegetation, the potential was not fully realized because only a small proportion of the stream flow interacts with riparian zone soils. Consequently, effective NO3–N water quality management in poorly drained landscapes similar to the study watershed is primarily dependent on implementation of sound agricultural practices within grass seed fields and is less influenced by riparian zone vegetation. Wise fertilizer application rates and timing are key management tools to reduce export of NO3–N in stream waters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soaring childhood obesity rates have led to questions about the influence of obesogenic environments on children's health. Public health interventions that target the retail food environment around schools have been proposed, but whether these interventions are evidence based is unclear. METHODS: We examined associations between the retail food environment near schools and food purchasing, consumption, and bodyweight of students. We catalogued and critiqued the methods and results of studies analysing these associations and sought to assess the quality of evidence within the publications. We undertook a keyword search of several databases and sources of grey literature, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Public Health Group specialised register. Inclusion criteria required studies to be published in a peer-reviewed journal between January, 1981, and October, 2012, provide at least one measurement of food retailing surrounding schools, and include outcome data for school children aged 5–18 years. Two researchers independently reviewed papers and blindly assessed the quality of the study using a modified checklist that covered study design and reporting. Methodological heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, so we used a semiquantitative method in which we categorised papers according to their outcomes and identified whether or not the outcome was significantly (p<0·05) associated with the density or proximity of food outlets near schools. FINDINGS: 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. All followed a cross-sectional study design. 19 described the food environment with geographical-system-information-based measures (eg, the density or proximity of food outlets within a buffer zone around the school) and two characterised the food environment using qualitative data. Outcome measures varied considerably. Only one study examined effects on food purchasing behaviour. Far more common were studies examining effects on the consumption of fruit and vegetables and of foods high in fat, sugar, or salt, or the effects on bodyweight. The one study that examined the associations between food outlets and food purchases showed a significant correlation between the proximity of fast food outlets and the number of fast food purchases. Five papers assessed associations between food outlets around schools and the consumption of fruits and vegetables. 34 relations were assessed, half of which showed a positive correlation. Only one of these results was significant (p<0·05). Five papers assessed associations between the food environment and consumption of foods high in fat, sugar, or salt. 41 assessments were reported, 21 of which showed that the number of food outlets near schools was associated with increased consumption of these foods. None of the results were significant. 14 papers examined associations between the food environment and increased bodyweight. 57 assessments were reported, 33 of which were positive and the remainder negative. Among the positive associations, 15 were significant. Among the 24 negative associations, seven were significant. INTERPRETATION: This review of the scientific literature found very little evidence for an effect of the retail food environment surrounding schools on food purchases and consumption patterns, but some evidence of an effect on bodyweight. Given the general lack of evidence for association with the mediating variables of food purchasing and food consumption, and the observational nature of the studies included in this review, it is possible that this finding is a result of residual confounding. The methods for the studies varied, but many contained worrying limitations; for example, most studies measured exposure at the level of the school and only one study considered children's actual journeys through the food environment. Better studies are required to inform effective public health policies. FUNDING: British Heart Foundation, NHS Berkshire.

AB  - A manure erosion equation was developed and added to the APEX model for use in estimating nutrient losses from feedlots and manure application fields. The modified APEX was validated with data from feedlots near Bushland, Texas, and Carrington, North Dakota. The model was used to investigate feedlot management options on a hypothetical feedlot with realistic data. Vegetative filter strip (VFS) characteristics including 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% FLRs (flow length ratios, i.e., filter flow length/feedlot flow length) and slopes of 1%, 5%, and 10% were considered. Combinations of these VFS characteristics were compared on two soil types: clay loam and fine sandy loam. Management options included three stocking rates (10, 15, and 20 m2 head(-1)) and two clean-out intervals (90 and 180 d). Additionally, two climatic conditions (precipitation of 440 and 825 mm year(-1)) were simulated. Results from 50-year simulations indicate that a VFS downslope of the feedlot can greatly reduce nutrient loads. All three VFS characteristics (FLR, slope, and soil) were important in controlling organic N and P losses. The best organic N and P control was obtained from a VFS with maximum FLR (100%), minimum slope (1%), and a sandy loam soil. Results were similar for soluble N and P control except that VFS slope had little effect. The simulated management options (clean-out interval and stocking rate) were also effective in controlling nutrient losses. The climatic variable (annual precipitation) gave higher nutrient losses from the feedlot and the VFS with 825 mm than with 440 mm. Nutrient control efficiencies, CEs, 100.* (1.0 - nutrient loss from VFS / nutrient loss from feedlot) were calculated for all scenarios considered. The VFSs on sandy loam soil with FLRs equal to or greater than 50% gave the highest CEs for both soluble and organic nutrients. Other factors including VFS slope, clean-out interval, and stocking rate had marginal impacts on CE. For soluble nutrients, CE is inversely related to annual precipitation. Thus, it is important to locate feedlots in areas with low precipitation and to provide a well designed VFS. The APEX model with the new manure erosion equation provides a tool for designing VFSs for controlling nutrient losses from feedlots.

AB  - An increase in edge area reduces the effective size of habitat fragments and thus the area available for habitat-interior specialists. However, it is unclear how edge effects compare at different ecotones in the same system. We investigated the response of a small mammal community associated with Afromontane forests to edge effects at three different habitat transitions: natural forest to grassland (natural edge, structurally different vegetation types), natural forest to mature plantation (human-altered edge, structurally similar vegetation types) and natural forest to harvested plantation (human-altered edge, structurally different vegetation types). We predicted that edge effects should be less severe at natural ecotones and at similarly structured contiguous vegetation types than human-altered ecotones and differently structured contiguous vegetation types, respectively. We found that forest species seemed to avoid all habitat edges in our study area. Surprisingly, natural edges supported a less diverse small mammal community than human-altered forest edges. However, edge effects were observed deeper into native forests surrounded by mature alien plantations (and more so at harvested plantations) than into native forests surrounded by native grasslands. The net effect of mature plantations was therefore to reduce the functional size of the natural forest by creating a larger edge. We suggest that when plantations are established a buffer zone of natural vegetation be left between natural forests and newly established plantations to mitigate the negative effects of plantation forestry.

AB  - The use of flowering field margins is often proposed as a method to support biological control in agro-ecosystems. In addition to beneficial insects, many herbivores depend on floral food as well. The indiscriminate use of flowering species in field margins can therefore lead to higher pest numbers. Based on results from field observations and laboratory experiments we assessed risks as well as benefits associated with the provision of nectar plants in field margins, using Brussels sprouts as a model system. Results show that Brussels sprouts bordered by nectar plants suitable for the cabbage white Pieris rapae L., suffered higher infestation levels by this herbivore. In contrast, nectar plants providing accessible nectar for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L., did not raise densities of P. xylostella larvae in the Brassica crop. Margins with Anethum graveolens L., selected on the basis of its suitability as nectar plant for parasitoids, significantly increased the number of adult Diadegma semiclausum Hellén in the crop. This didn't translate into enhanced parasitism rates, as parasitism of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum exceeded 65 % in all treatments, irrespective of the plants in the field margin. Our findings emphasize the importance of taking a multitrophic approach when choosing flowering field margin plants for biocontrol or other ecosystem services.

AB  - This dissertation is a series of studies related to the development of a TMDL for the Olentangy watershed. In the first study, a customized version of the SWAT model was used to predict hydrology and water chemistry for the Olentangy River watershed (1985-2002). This version of SWAT simulated a restrictive layer in the soil profile and its impact on subsurface drainage, watershed hydrology, and nutrient and sediment transport. Model parameterization and calibration are presented. Following model calibration all land use in the watershed was changed to forest, prairie, or wetlands to predict potential water quality of pre-European conditions. Results suggest that sediment, total phosphorus, and nitrate-nitrogen at the watershed outlet have increased by factors of approximately 50, 20, and 3, respectively, for most subwatersheds in the watershed. The calibrated SWAT model was used to predict the potential water quality benefits of alternative management scenarios. Alternative management scenarios that were evaluated include: 1) crop rotations, 2) fertilizer application rates, 3) types of tillage, 4) timing of tillage operations, and 5) buffer strips. A 33-meter buffer strip was predicted to provide the largest water quality benefits when compared to other alternative management scenarios. Another study was conducted to develop a geomorphology assessment index to provide a logical and minimally biased framework to evaluate dynamic equilibrium at study sites in the Olentangy River watershed. Regional curves were developed using geomorphology data from study sites impacted by a variety of disturbances. A diagnostic approach that integrated multiple lines of evidence was used to develop the index. In chapter 5 a statistical analysis was conducted to examine species-environment relationships between stream biology and environmental variables such as water quality, habitat, spatial location, and geomorphology. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to elucidate relationships between biology and environmental variability. Partial CCA techniques were used to partition variation among the groups of environmental variables. Environmental variables were grouped into three categories including geomorphology variables, habitat variables, and spatial location variables. The partial CCA technique was used to partition variation between each of these variable groups. Results suggest that geomorphology variables explained the most variation.

AB  - The first field study of a genetically altered virus in the United States wa, performed with an isolate of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), which lacks a polyhedrin gene. In the first year of the study, three applications of 7.4 X 10(11) AcMNPV polyhedra containing 48% genetically altered and 52% wild-type virus particles (co-occluded) were made on a 0.1-ha circular plot of cabbage plants. The application area was surrounded by a 0.7-ha circular buffer zone. Before each application, the plants in the application area were infested with 4,500 third-instar Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) larvae. After each application, 100% of the T. ni test larvae sampled 5 d after infection were infected with AcMNPV and produced progeny polyhedra containing an average of 42 +/- 17.6% genetically altered virus particles. At the end of the 1st yr, the progeny polyhedra population in the application area was estimated at 1.6 X 10(13) polyhedra. In the 2nd yr, the application and buffer sites were replanted with cabbage plants. At four times during the growing season, the plants were seeded with T. ni larvae or eggs. Less than 2% of the test larvae became infected with AcMNPV. Polyhedra were extracted from soil samples collected in the application and buffer areas. Using neonate larval bioassays with the soil extracts, it was estimated that the soil in the application and buffer areas contained an average of 1,652 +/- 3,370 and 832 +/- 2,539 biologically active polyhedra per gram dry weight, respectively. Seventy-five larvae infected with polyhedra extracted from application area soil samples produced progeny polyhedra containing a mean of 9 +/- 19% genetically altered virus particles. In the 3rd yr, the application area soil samples contained an average of 1,671 +/- 3,274 biologically active polyhedra per gram dry weight, Eighty-four progeny polyhedral samples contained a mean of 6 +/- 14% genetically altered virus particles

AB  - Nutrients from feedlot runoff can infiltrate beneath long-term storage ponds. Pond embankments' wetting and drying cycles facilitate infiltration paths as does weed growth that form roots channels. The research objectives were to construct and evaluate a passive runoff control system to reduce or eliminate long-term liquid storage. Runoff volumes, nutrient totals, and peak discharge were estimated using the Nutrient Fate Model for Beef Cattle Feedlots (Eigenberg et al., 1995). A vegetative filter strip was sized based on these estimated values. A flat-bottom terrace was constructed to collect runoff, provide temporary liquid storage, and accumulate settable solids, while distributing the nutrient laden liquid fraction uniformly across a vegetative filter strip. No runoff from the vegetative filter strip was recorded during the study period that lasted from 1999 through 2001, indicating that the basin discharge was effectively utilized for grass production. The volume of water remaining in the basin that was available for deep infiltration was greatly reduced when compared to traditional long-term runoff storage systems. This reduction was evident as the solids storage system began to accumulate solids, thereby reducing the total liquid storage volume of the basin. The passive beef cattle feedlot runoff treatment system appeared to be an improvement to traditional storage systems.

AB  - The recent signing of the NPDES permit regulations and effluent limitations guidelines for CAFO has generated much interest from smaller beef cattle feeding operations for a more cost-effective solution for managing feedlot runoff. A passive runoff control and treatment system was constructed to reduce long-term liquid storage, provide solids separation, and evenly distribute the liquid discharge for grass hay production. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this passive system for reducing contaminant discharge. The system effectively reduced the cumulative mass of total and volatile suspended solids and reduced chemical oxygen demand by 80%, 67%, and 59%, respectively. Significant reductions of these constituents in the runoff water as it passed through the system were measured for most precipitation events. No water was measured exiting the vegetative filter strip during the three-year period of this study. Therefore, the discharge water was effectively contained and used for hay crop production. Estimated total nitrogen (TN) load in the discharge water entering the vegetative filter strip was equivalent to or less than the TN removed by the crop. System robustness was demonstrated during feedlot pen renovation when significant reductions in contaminant concentrations were measured for most all precipitation events during that period.

AB  - Runoff from beef cattle feedlots is usually stored in holding ponds. These ponds can be a concentrated source for contaminating surface and groundwater. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) can be effective in protecting surface and groundwater by reducing diffuse contamination. The objectives of this project were to evaluate the contaminant control by the system, and to determine the sustainability of the VFS for nutrient and runoff water control. A runoff control system for a small feedlot was constructed to utilize a VFS for water and nutrient control. To reduce contamination load, a debris basin was constructed to collect and store suspended solids. The basin provided 5 - 8 minute hydraulic retention, before evenly discharging the water across the VFS. Over a three year period, the debris basin effectively reduced the mass of total and volatile suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand by 80, 67, and 59%, respectively. Significant contaminant reductions in the runoff water were measured as it passed through the system for most precipitation events. No water was measured exiting the VFS during the three year study period by either infiltration below the root zone or by direct release from the site; therefore, the discharge water from the basin was effectively used for hay crop production. The estimated total nitrogen load in the discharge water entering the VFS was equivalent to or less than the total nitrogen removed by the crop. Two-dimensional electromagnetic induction maps have been generated beginning before the VFS was put in operation and have continued to the present. These maps were used to illustrate zones within the VFS where salt and nutrient loading are occurring. The apparent electrical conductivity of the VFS in the region of the debris basin discharge tubes have been disproportional increased due to salt and nutrient loading. Surface soil nitrate-nitrogen levels, particularly closest to the discharge tubes, have also increased.

AB  - 1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.

AB  - 1. Although the importance of plant community assemblages in structuring invertebrate assemblages is well known, the role that architectural complexity plays is less well understood. In particular, direct empirical data for a range of invertebrate taxa showing how functional groups respond to plant architecture is largely absent from the literature. 2. The significance of sward architectural complexity in determining the species richness of predatory and phytophagous functional groups of spiders, beetles, and true bugs, sampled from 135 field margin plots over 2 years was tested. The present study compares the relative importance of sward architectural complexity to that of plant community assemblage. 3. Sward architectural complexity was found to be a determinant of species richness for all phytophagous and predatory functional groups. When individual species responses were investigated, 62.5% of the spider and beetle species, and 50.0% of the true bugs responded to sward architectural complexity. 4. Interactions between sward architectural complexity and plant community assemblage indicate that the number of invertebrate species supported by the plant community alone could be increased by modification of sward architecture. Management practices could therefore play a key role in diversifying the architectural structure of existing floral assemblages for the benefit of invertebrate assemblages. 5. The contrasting effects of sward architecture on invertebrate functional groups characterised by either direct (phytophagous species) or indirect (predatory species) dependence on plant communities is discussed. It is suggested that for phytophagous taxa, plant community assemblage alone is likely to be insufficient to ensure successful species colonisation or persistence without appropriate development of sward architecture.

AB  - This study investigated how local habitat type and landscape structure affects the biomass, species richness and functional diversity of ground beetles sampled from a 1000ha UK arable farm. At a local scale habitat type was either crop (winter wheat and oilseed rape) or one of five field margin habitats. Surrounding each of these sampling areas, landscape structure was defined using remote sensed data from Specim AISA Eagle (400-970nm) and Hawk (970-2450nm) hyperspectral sensors. Ground beetles were divided into predatory and phytophagous trophic levels. Local habitat type only affected phytophagous ground beetle biomass, which was lowest within crops. Total biomass of predatory beetles was negatively correlated, and species richness positively correlated, with landscape habitat diversity. Only the functional diversity of predatory ground beetles responded to landscape structure, showing positive correlations with the proportion of Tussock Grass field margins. Predatory ground beetles show a greater dependence on landscape structure than phytophagous species, a response that is attributed to their high mobility needed for movement between dynamically variable food resources.

AB  - Despite extensive focus on the genetic legacy of Pleistocene glaciation, impacts of earlier climatic change on biodiversity are poorly understood. Because amphibians are highly sensitive to variations in precipitation and temperature, we use a genus of Chinese montane salamanders (Salamandridae: Pachytriton) to study paleoclimatic change in East Asia, which experienced intensification of its monsoon circulation in the late Miocene associated with subsequent Pliocene warming. Using both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences, we reconstruct the species tree under a coalescent model and demonstrate that all major lineages originated before the Quaternary. Initial speciation within the genus occurred after the summer monsoon entered a stage of substantial intensification. Heavy summer precipitation established temporary water connectivity through overflows between adjacent stream systems, which may facilitate geographic range expansion by aquatic species such as Pachytriton. Species were formed in allopatry likely through vicariant isolation during or after range expansion. To evaluate the influence of Pliocene warming on these cold-adapted salamanders, we construct a novel temperature buffer-zone model, which suggests widespread physiological stress or even extinction during the warming period. A significant deceleration of species accumulation rate is consistent with Pliocene range contraction, which affected P. granulosus and P. archospotus the most because they lack large temperature buffer zones. In contrast, demographic growth occurred in species for which refugia persist. The buffer-zone model reveals the Huangshan Mountain as a potential climatic refugium, which is similar to that found for other East Asian organisms. Our approach can incorporate future climatic data to evaluate the potential impact of ongoing global warming on montane species (particularly amphibians) and to predict possible population declines.

AB  - Substantial questions remain about the time required for groundwater nitrate to be reduced below 10 mg L- 1 following establishment of vegetated riparian buffers. The objective of this study was to document changes in groundwater nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations that occurred within a few years of planting a riparian buffer. In 2000 and 2001 a buffer was planted adjacent to a first-order stream in the deep loess region of western Iowa with strips of walnut and cottonwood trees, alfalfa and brome grass, and switch grass. Non-parametric statistics showed significant declines in NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater following buffer establishment, especially mid 2003 and later. The dissolved oxygen generally was > 5 mg L- 1 beneath the buffer, and neither NO3-N nor DO changed significantly under a non-buffered control area. These short-term changes in groundwater NO3-N provide evidence that vegetated riparian buffers may yield local water-quality benefits within a few years of planting.

AB  - Zoning-by-grazing is a unique approach to making the entry of wild animals in human habitations less likely by means of a buffer zone along the borders between forest and farmland where cattle and other livestock animals are grazed. The purpose of this study was to determine the multiple effects of zoning-by-grazing, including reduction in agricultural damage by wild boars and vitalization of farm villages. A grazing zone (pasture) was established in a 2-ha paddy field where cultivation had been abandoned, adjoining Mt. Yamada in the Koyama District in Kinomoto Town, Shiga Prefecture. While grazing Japanese cattle and other livestock animals, surveys were performed on the behavior of wild boars using wireless transmitters, their occurrence and tracks on animal trails, and agricultural damage over the six years from 2001 to 2006. In the first three years, almost no wild boars appeared in and around the pasture. In the last three years, their occurrence centralized in the wood near the pasture, with only a few entering the pasture in the sixth year. Throughout the study period, however, no wild boars entered the adjoining farmland; the grazing zone was effective in preventing agricultural damage by wild boars. A questionnaire-based survey on the people in the district showed that zoning-by-grazing was also effective in vitalizing the district, including restoration of people' s volition for farming, creation of good landscapes, and emotional education for children. Meanwhile, the clearance of wild boar damage was followed by a crop change from paddy rice to wheat or soybeans by a group of farmers in the farmland adjoining to the pasture. As a result, their average annual income for the district increased by about 1.7 million yen; revitalization of farming by zoning-by-grazing had an economic effect.

AB  - Vegetative buffers, if established around riparian areas, represent a type of beneficial management practice (BMP) that provide ecological goods and services in the form of improved water quality, improved wildlife/waterfowl habitat, etc. Establishing these buffers result in reduced area for agricultural production, with corresponding opportunity costs. This study builds on previous work from AAFC's Watershed Evaluation of Beneficial Management Practices (WEBs) project, to examine the direct farm-level economics of vegetative buffers for a representative mixed farm operation in the Lower Little Bow watershed. Simulation results suggest that the opportunity cost associated with vegetative buffers varies with buffer width, but can be as great as $600 per acre converted. The cost per acre varies inversely with the width of the buffer.

AB  - A numerical catchment-scale model capable of simulating diffuse water pollution is necessary in sustainable environmental management for better implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. This paper provides critical reviews of most popular and free models for diffuse water modelling, with detailed sources and application potential. Based upon these reviews, further work of selecting and testing the HSPF model was carried out, with a case study in the Upper Bann Catchment, Northern Ireland. The calibrated and validated HSPF model can well represent the characteristics of surface water quantity and quality. Climate change scenario evaluation in 5 years showed that when the annual mean temperature increase 3°C the mean yearly total runoff volume will decrease by 11.1% and the mean daily river flow 11.4%. If 20% crop and pasture land is converted into forest land in the study area, the mean river concentration of nitrate, nitrite, NH₄ and PO₄ in 5 years will decrease by 19.4%, 33.3%, 31.3% and 31.3% respectively. When applying filter strip method in 80% crop and pasture land in the area, the reduction of the mean concentration of nitrate, nitrite, NH₄ and PO₄ in 5 years will be 15.3%, 33.3%, 31.3%, and 5.6% respectively. This study shows that HSPF is a suitable model in handling diffuse source water pollution, which can be introduced into the Programme of Measures in the River Basin Management Plans for better implementation of the EU WFD.

AB  - Habitat selection of field vole (Microtus agrestis) was studied using radiotelemetry in buffer zones in SW Finland. Buffer zones were manipulated in a multifactorial design by mowing and providing supplementary food and cover. The aims of the study were to establish relative roles of food and cover for the vole habitat selection and to determine whether habitat use differed between filter strips (5 m) and buffer zones (>15 m). Also, seasonal differences in habitat use in these ecosystems were studied. Habitat use was measured in terms of home range size and habitat selection functions based on compositional analysis. Home range sizes tended to be larger and distances moved were longer in narrow than in wide buffer zones during manipulations. Field margin width had a significant impact on the use of available habitats. Habitats with vegetative cover were preferred to other available habitat types, particularly in wide buffer zones. Voles in the filter strips used crop fields and mowed areas significantly more than voles in buffer zones. Home ranges were smallest in winter and largest in autumn. There were no clear seasonal differences in the proportional use of crop field and buffer zone.

AB  - The Sakaerat Environmental Research Station (SERS) was established to promote long-term ecological research (LTER) and to demonstrate sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. In the past decade, the government puts a lot of efforts to rehabilitate degraded forest both inside and surrounding the SERS landscape in order to link fragmented forest patches. However, there is a lack of appropriate methods that allow the measurement of the effectiveness of reforestation. The objective of this paper is to quantify land use and landscape structure changes between 1990 and 2002. The study area encompasses the SERS and its buffer zone. Land use/land cover maps were visually interpreted into 9 classes using temporal Landsat-TM images. These classes include dry evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, dry dipterocarp forest, secondary growth, plantation, grassland, old clearing, agriculture & settlement, and water body. In addition, Geographic Information (GIS) and FRAGSTATS package were used to assess fragmentation indices. The results revealed that the annual increment rate of dry evergreen forest and dry dipterocarp forest were 0.51% and 0.97%, respectively. In addition, the surface area of forest plantation gained roughly three times or increased 193.23% during this period. On the other hand, agricultural and settlement area decreases 7.56% per year, most area was replaced by plantation and natural regeneration. The fragmentation indices indicated that the remaining dry evergreen forest was highly aggregated or low fragmentation. The number of patches decreased from 7 to 5 patches and mean patch size increased significantly. However, mixed deciduous forest and dry dipterocarp forest showed relative fragmentation. Mixed deciduous forest showed higher fragmentation. Mean patch size area was substantially decreased from 293 ha in 1990 to 123 ha in 2002 and the mean nearest neighbour distance increased approximately 400 m during this period.

Sacrifice lots are usually denuded of vegetation and have high concentrations of manure and urine that can contribute significant amounts of sediment, nutrients, and pathogens to nearby surface waters. In this study, stream water quality impacted by direct runoff from a sacrifice lot was monitored for a period of 20 months. Ambient stream water quality was monitored by grab sampling upstream and downstream of the sacrifice lot. During runoff events, stream water quality downstream of the sacrifice lot was monitored with an automatic sampler. Laboratory analyses were conducted for total suspended solids and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds). A grass filter strip (GFS) was installed as a buffer downslope of the sacrifice lot 10 months into the study period. The impact of the buffer strip on the standardized pollutant concentrations and loads was evaluated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The Wilcoxon test indicated that there was no significant difference (alpha = 0.05) in the standardized yield of sediment and dissolved pollutants before and after the GFS installation, except for phosphate-phosphorus and filtered total phosphorus concentrations, and sediment-bound total phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen loads that decreased significantly. However, load decrease could have been partially caused by the smaller rainfall volumes after the GFS installation as compared to the existing condition

AB  - A stochastic model is developed to study the spatial spread and control of tsetse flies, Glossina spp. In this model, the movement mechanism is described by the travel direction and distance of an individual tsetse fly, birth and death rates are described by probability distributions, and some control measures are considered. The model is used to estimate the straight-line distance traveled in the life span of a fly, and the distance fly populations will spread during a 10-yr period. Simulation results indicate that the straight-line distance traveled in the life span of a tsetse fly is 1.71 km from its birth place. The spread distance for fly populations is approximately 18.7 km by the end of the 10th yr based on a 99% confidence prediction limit. Strategies of preventing tsetse flies from advancing to a tsetse-free region are examined. The probabilities that a fly crosses a protective barrier (buffer zone) are obtained for different control methods. The width of a protective barrier required to prevent the tsetse flies from advancing to a tsetse-free region is estimated

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of riparian buffers between agricultural fields and waterbodies. Riparian buffers play an important role in mitigating the impacts of land use activities on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. However, evaluating the effectiveness of riparian buffer systems on a watershed scale is complex, and watershed models have limited capabilities for simulating riparian buffer processes. Thus, the overall objective of this paper is to develop an understanding of riparian buffer processes towards water quality modelling/monitoring and nonpoint source pollution assessment. The paper provides a thorough review of relevant literature on the performance of vegetative buffers on sediment reduction. It was found that although sediment trapping capacities are site- and vegetation-specific, and many factors influence the sediment trapping efficiency, the width of a buffer is important in filtering agricultural runoff and wider buffers tended to trap more sediment. Sediment trapping efficiency is also affected by slope, but the overall relationship is not consistent among studies. Overall, sediment trapping efficiency did not vary by vegetation type and grass buffers and forest buffers have roughly the same sediment trapping efficiency. This analysis can be used as the basis for planning future studies on watershed scale simulation of riparian buffer systems, design of effective riparian buffers for nonpoint source pollution control or water quality restoration and design of riparian buffer monitoring programs in watersheds.

AB  - Feitsui reservoir, the major water supply of Taipei city; has shown declining water quality in recent years. The reservoir is located in an area famous for tea cultivation, and the question arises as to whether the hillside tea plantations have contributed to increased sediment and nutrient discharge into the reservoir. In this study, soil and phosphorus redistribution were examined along a steep tea plantation in the reservoir's catchment and the provenance of reservoir sediment was assessed. Fallout radionuclides were used as soil erosion/deposition tracers and as markers of sediment sources. Continuous fertilizer application has raised (inorganic) phosphorus levels in the studied tea plantation. The plantation's narrow bench terraces trap eroded material and slow down soil and nutrient translocation. Nevertheless, eroded soil and phosphorus have accumulated on a vegetated toeslope below the tea plantation. The reservoir sediment contained significant amounts of inorganic phosphorus and cesium-137, and application of a mixing model resulted in a surface soil contribution of approximately 30%. This points towards tea plantations as possible sediment and pollutant sources and underlines the necessity of soil conservation strategies, such as the maintenance of vegetated riparian buffer zones. However, other sources, such as landslide debris and urban wastewaters, cannot be entirely ruled out. Further research is needed to better characterize the catchment's soils and sediments and to improve sediment fingerprinting efforts. Potential point and non-point pollution sources need to be examined in detail to better understand how phosphorus enters the reservoir.

AB  - Taihu Lake is located at the center of Changjiang delta region, the Lake and its effluent rivers are important water sources for 40 million around inhabitants and rapidly increasing industrial factories in Shanghai, Ji-angsu and Zhejiang. The pollutants originate mainly from acidy rain, home sewage of the vast number of inhabitants, livestock manure, agricultural fertilizers & pesticides applied over fields in the drainage basin, and the industrial sewage. Due to the kinds of pollutants, the Lake water is getting highly eutrophic, with frequent blooms of blue-green algae. Compared with point-source pollutants, diffuse pollution is much com-plicated and difficult to control. Thus combating non-point pollution (NPP) is paid much great attention. Based on analysis on source-sink of NPP in Taihu Lake basin, it is concluded that the function of forests on NPP control is multiple and important by both source reduction and sink expansion. The primary objective of planting trees through constructing forested wetlands and establishing riparian forest buffers is to control soil & water erosion, decrease agrochemicals application, and improve farming conditions in the region of Taihu Lake basin. Moreover forests help to intercept acidy rain, protect streambanks, uptake nutrients, hold up pollutants and provide habitat for wildlife.

AB  - Current management plans for nature reserves in China are ineffective and do not meet their intended goals of balancing conservation and development. Protected area zoning is an approach that can reduce conflict by partitioning the landscape into various land use units that are managed for different levels of human activity. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology that integrates a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Meili Snow Mountain National Park (MSMNP), Yunnan. A participatory process involving multiple stakeholders and technical experts was used to establish park management objectives: nature conservation; tourism and recreation; and, community development. To meet these three objectives, criteria and impact factors for each objective were identified and weighted through a participatory process, and a GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion. Three suitability maps of conservation, eco-tourism, and community development were generated. The three suitability maps were overlaid to generate a final combined suitability map, and five management zones (strict protected zone, ecosystem conservation zone, eco-tourism zone or buffer zone, park service zone, and traditional land use zone) were identified and mapped that corresponded to different protection and management strategies. Conservation targets (endangered species, alpine and forest ecosystems) and development zones were spatially segregated across the landscape, and the final zoning scheme was found to be acceptable by the various stakeholders.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation and habitat loss are one of the important factors resulting in biodiversity decrease and species extinction. A large amount of Eucalyptus have been introduced into Yunnan Province in China since 2003, replaced the native forest, farmland, wasteland and other ecosystems, leading to natural habitat loss and landscape fragmentation. In order to protect habitat and the biodiversity, the secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest were selected as “protection source”, land cover types, altitude, slope and soil texture were selected as resistance factors, to construct a medium-security and high-security level landscape eco-security patterns for Eucalyptus introduction regions by using the minimum cumulative resistance model and GIS technology. The patterns were composed of the eco-security pattern compositions and ecological function zones. The eco-security pattern compositions were composed of corridor, radiating routes and strategic point etc. The ecological function zones were composed of key eco-protection zone, eco-buffer zone, eco-transition zone, Eucalyptus planting zone, Eucalyptus banned zones, farming zone, living zone etc.

AB  - In this study, the effect of buffer zone size on the performance of a regional climate model (RCM) was investigated. In contrast to carrying out simulations where the buffer zone expands inward, numerical experiments were performed with the buffer zone expanded outward, which ensured an objective comparison on the effect of buffer zone sizes. Case simulations on the abnormal 1998 East Asian summer monsoon demonstrated that an RCM's performance depended on the outward expansion of the buffer zone. Moreover, a broader buffer zone is able to improve large-scale circulation simulation in the upper troposphere; however, a narrower buffer zone shows better performance in the middle and lower troposphere. Numerical experiments show that the performance of RCMs in simulating the seasonal evolution of rainbands over eastern China is not completely consistent with that of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). A possible reason why the configuration with the buffer zone expanding inward can improve the extension/withdrawal of the summer monsoon and the associated precipitation evolution over eastern China is discussed.

AB  - We obtained vertical distribution of diffusion coefficients of single gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the extracellular solution space of living cells with optical sectioning darkfield microscopy. It was identified that before reaching the plasma membrane surface during their cellular uptake process, AuNPs must diffuse through a viscous pericellular “buffer zone” several microns thick where their motion is retarded significantly. The pericellular layer exists in two different cell types and is unrelated to the surface chemistry of AuNPs. Further studies on its properties and manipulation may help the development of nanoparticle probes and carriers.

AB  - We determined the extent that a riparian buffer reduces stream suspended sediment concentrations by filtering road runoff during 18 rain events in a 2.5-ha, multi-use watershed in northern Thailand. The dominant buffer species was the perennial sedge Fimbristylis aphylla Zoll. ex Steud. (Cyperaceae). We monitored stream sediment concentration for situations where road runoff either flowed into the riparian buffer or was diverted directly into the stream (buffer and no buffer scenarios). These data were used to develop the following relationships between instantaneous stream sediment concentration (C(i)) and discharge (Q(i)): C(i) = 28.329Q(i)0.851 (buffer scenario) and C(i) = 22.265Q(i)1.579 (no buffer scenario). Using these functions to calculate total event suspended concentrations, we determined that the buffer reduced suspended sediment concentration by 34 to 87%, for the range of events monitored. Removal of sediment from runoff generated on a 2.4-m-wide, 165-m-long unpaved road section was achieved principally via ponding, which reduced the transport capacity as flow entered the relatively flat, saturated buffer. Sediment deposition occurred primarily within the first 10 m of the buffer. Some sediment was also deposited on the fillslope leading to the buffer. Maximum road sediment concentration during the largest buffer event approached 100 000 mg L(-1). Meanwhile, the corresponding maximum stream suspended sediment concentration was <4000 mg L(-1). In contrast, maximum stream concentrations when flow bypassed the buffer during smaller events were commonly 4000 to 7000 mg L(-1). Naturally occurring buffers represent an economical means of mitigating road-related impacts in upland basins in Southeast Asia, particularly if combined with measures limiting sediment and runoff production on contributing road sections.

AB  - The Europe‐wide decline in the populations and diversity of farmland birds has not been stopped despite dedicated conservation efforts such as agri‐environment schemes (AES). The main reason for the lack of success of AES is considered to be their low ecological quality and insufficient area. Understanding the effects of different management strategies on the ecological quality of AES is therefore important. Here, we investigate the relationship between breeding bird density and species richness and the age of sown field margins, a widely used type of AES, in southwestern Switzerland. Territories of breeding birds were mapped on 67 field margins between 2004 and 2011. Territory densities (for eight species) and species richness were analysed in relation to age of the field margin. A general negative correlation between size of the field margin and territory density indicated that territory density was higher when the birds could forage in adjacent cultivated land. Territory densities and species richness increased up to an age of 4–6� years after sowing, depending on the species, and declined thereafter. The results suggest that the co‐occurrence of newly sown margins and margins over 3� years old will have a positive effect on breeding bird densities and species diversity.
