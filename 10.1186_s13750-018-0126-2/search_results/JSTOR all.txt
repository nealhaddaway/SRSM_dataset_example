AB  - The urbanization of agricultural lands is currently one of the dominant patterns of land use change in developed countries. In the United States and parts of Europe, this has led to the implementation of agricultural land preservation programs and riparian protection and replanting efforts along urban streams. The ecological benefits of such programs for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity have yet to be fully explored. We designed a study to investigate the patterns of stream macroinvertebrate community structure along a gradient of agriculture to urban development, and the patterns among urban streams that vary in the amount of intact riparian buffer. In 2001 and 2002, we sampled the 29 small headwater streams comprising the outlying tributaries of four watersheds just north of Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This region has had dramatic urban development over the last 50 years, yet significant efforts have been made to maintain riparian buffers and promote preservation of agricultural land. Macroinvertebrate richness was strongly related to land use, with agricultural streams exhibiting the highest macroinvertebrate diversity. Taxa richness was related negatively and linearly (no statistical threshold) to the amount of impervious surface cover. For the urban streams, there was a strong positive relationship between invertebrate diversity and riparian forest cover. Urban streams with high amounts of intact riparian forest exhibited biodiversity levels more comparable to less urban areas despite high amounts of impervious cover in their catchments. The agricultural headwater streams in this study were not only more diverse than the urban headwaters, but their levels of macroinvertebrate diversity were high compared to other published estimates for agricultural streams. These higher richness values may be due to widespread use of "best management practices" (BMPs), including no-till farming and the implementation of woody and herbaceous riparian buffers, which may alleviate many acute stressors caused by cultivation. These findings suggest that, if managed properly, the preservation of agricultural land from development may help conserve stream invertebrate biodiversity, and that maintenance of riparian forests even in highly urbanized watersheds may help alleviate ecological disturbances that might otherwise limit macroinvertebrate survival.

AB  - Recent research, at Mississippi State has shown that eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and tall fescue grown as filter strips reduce herbicide losses in runoff from cotton. Field experiments were conducted in 1997 and 1998 to evaluate the response of these perennial grasses to postemergence drift and registered rates of glyphosate and paraquat in mid-April and clethodim, fluazifop-P, glyphosate, MSMA, pyrithiobac, quizalofop-P, and sethoxydim in early June. Results indicate that filter strip implementation will not simply involve establishment and maintenance. In most instances, reductions in harvested biomass were as high or higher than visual injury assessments in mid-June. This finding suggests an inability of these perennial grasses to recover from an accidental overspray or drift, within the year of the event. Management decisions must be made to protect the filter strips from contact with herbicides used in the production system to ensure filter strip integrity and survival.

AB  - Field studies were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 to determine the effectiveness of several grasses as filter strips for reducing sediment and herbicide losses in runoff. Big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and tall fescue reduced total runoff volume by at least 55, 76, 49, and 46%, respectively. Within the 127-d sampling period, each perennial grass filter strip investigated reduced total sediment loss in surface runoff by at least 66%. All four species reduced total fluometuron loss in runoff at least 59%. Big bluestem and eastern gamagrass reduced norflurazon loss in runoff 63 and 86%, respectively. When a filter strip was present, fluometuron and norflurazon losses did not exceed 5 and 3% of the total applied, respectively, compared to 12 and 5%, respectively, when a filter strip was not present.

AB  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to compare the adsorption and desorption of fluometuron between two soils, one collected from an eastern gamagrass filter strip and the other from a cropped field. Fluometuron adsorption to soil collected from the filter strip was higher than to soil collected from the cropped field. K d values for fluometuron ranged from 1.9 to 3.6 for soil from a cropped area, compared with 2.9 to 5.3 for soil from the filter strip, indicating a weak to moderate binding affinity for fluometuron. The total fluometuron desorbed ranged from 48 to 79% of that adsorbed, most of which (50 to 59% of the total amount desorbed) occurred during the first desorption cycle with both soils. Approximately 11% less fluometuron desorbed when a filter strip was present. Results indicate that eastern gamagrass filter strips can influence adsorption-desorption processes between fluometuron and a Brooksville silty clay soil by altering the soil properties, specifically soil organic matter.

AB  - In mammalian pregnancy the trophoblast normally constitutes an uninterrupted boundary of foetal tissue in immediate contact with maternal tissue, including blood in some species, and is the decisive immunological barrier to rejection of the foetus as an allograft. The ability of the trophoblast to function as a barrier evidently results from its capacity to resist immunological attack by either alloantibody or alloimmune cells and to prevent immunocompetent cells from reaching and damaging the foetus but, as yet, there is no general agreement regarding the means by which it exercises these functions. In view of the dramatic hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and the undisputed involvement of trophoblast in these endocrine events, the possibility exists of an interaction between the hormones of pregnancy and the immunological phenomena. The present account furnishes evidence that endocrine activity at the maternal surface of the trophoblast, the presumptive site of the immunological frontier between foetus and mother, may be a factor in its local survival at implantation. The placental hormones so far known that are capable of blocking the antigen receptor sites of the mother's lymphocytes and thus preventing the latter from reacting with the foetal antigens are the glycoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and the polypeptide hormone, human chorionic somatomammotrophin (HCS) or human placental lactogen (HPL), both of which are specific to the human placenta. The origin of these hormones, their spatial distribution and their probable interaction with placental steroid hormones are discussed. It is argued that the place of highest concentration of these hormones is on the surface of the syncytial microvilli and the adjacent caviolae of the apical plasma membrane, as well as on the surfaces of the persisting cytotrophoblastic cells of the basal plate (cytotrophoblastic shell), the cell islands and the septa - precisely where the immunological challenge of the foetal allograft to the maternal host occurs. An explanation is offered for the continuing production of the voluminous quantities of these hormones during human pregnancy.

AB  - AbstractN and C cycles in headwater streams are coupled, and land use can modify these cycles by increasing N availability and removing riparian vegetation. To increase our understanding of how land use modifies the controls on N cycling, we quantified rates of 2 microbial N transformations in a total of 18 agricultural and urban streams (with and without riparian buffers) for 3 y to examine how riparian vegetation and land use influence sediment nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3&#x2013; concentration (multiple linear regression, R2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Sediment C content, the primary predictor of denitrification rates, did not differ among land uses, but streamwater NO3&#x2013; concentration, the secondary predictor of denitrification rates, was highest in winter and in agricultural streams, indicating that land use and season were more important determinants of denitrification than coupled nitrification. Substrate availability (N and C) for N transformations generally did not differ between buffered and unbuffered streams within a similar landuse type, probably because of the confounding influence of tile drainage systems, which effectively decouple stream channels from their riparian zones. Land use influenced the delivery of the necessary substrates for N transformations but decreased the role of riparian zones in stream N cycling by simplifying the drainage network of headwater streams.

AB  - Efforts to stimulate more intensive land use must be based on a solid understanding of current farmer strategies and the factors that drive them. This paper discusses the influences on agricultural strategy among farmers in Pet&#xe9;n, Guatemala, and more specifically, their adoption of more intensive practices. Existing theoretical frameworks pertaining to agricultural intensification are based on a limited number of explanatory variables and thus provide an incomplete understanding of farmer strategy and of how and why it varies among farmers and communities. A more useful analytical approach is to consider the wide range of factors at both the regional/community scale and the farm/household scale that influence farmers' need, desire, and ability to alter their production strategies. An analysis based on this approach indicates that conservation and development organizations in Pet&#xe9;n should place greater emphasis on the rural economy and on fostering the conditions that would stimulate more intensive, sustainable land use.

AB  - The use of riparian land buffers to protect water quality for human consumption and wildlife habitat has become an important conservation tool of both government and non-government agencies. The funds available to acquire private lands for riparian buffers are limited, however, and not all land contributes to water quality goals in the same way. Conservation agencies must therefore identify effective ways to allocate their scarce budgets in heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate how the acquisition of land for a riparian buffer can be viewed as a binary optimization problem and we apply the resulting model to a case study in New York.

AB  - The effects of ten different management regimes on the abundance and species richness of Araneae on pre-existing and newly expanded zones of field margins surrounding arable fields are compared in a large-scale experiment conducted between 1987 and 1991. Most of the management regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were 'set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae. Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.

AB  - Pseudoscorpions (Chthonius ischnocheles (Hermann) and C. orthodactylus (Leach) sensu strictus) were collected using a D-Vac over two-years from 60 field margins at Oxford University farm at Wytham, U.K. Old and new grassland margins were subjected to six different treatments involving spraying, non-intervention and four different cutting intensities. Significantly more pseudoscorpions were found in old compared to new margins, suggesting they may be attracted to litter build-up over time. Pseudoscorpion numbers were reduced on treatments subjected to two cuts annually, particularly when a summer cut was included, although this effect was ameliorated when the cuttings were left. However, pseudoscorpions were most numerous on treatments which involved no management because of the increase in leaf litter which may replicate a woodland environment. Adjacent hedges appear to buffer the effects of management: margins with adjacent hedges (rather than ditches or tracks) having more individuals. In contrast to results for other invertebrate groups, sowing wildflower seed did not significantly increase the abundance of pseudoscorpions. The effect of different treatments on pseudoscorpion numbers demonstrates that they are useful indicators of the effects of management practice.

AB  - Vegetation, water and soil analyses were carried out along six transects in Scragh Bog, a fen in Co Westmeath, Ireland. The N and P plant tissue concentrations were higher in the buffer zone and the vegetation composition indicated eutraphent species. The available P-concentration in the soil and the N and P concentrations in water were increased in the border zone compared to the central fen samples. This eutrophic border zone is c 5m wide, which appears to be a natural width for this buffer zone. Rapidly growing grasses profit the most from this increase in nutrient availability, but the availability of N is still limiting plant growth. There is no direct threat to the rare fen communities with the present adjacent land use.

AB  - Although riparian buffers established along streams in agricultural landscapes are expected to provide water-quality functions similar to natural ecosystems, few studies have documented specific changes in the condition of aquatic resources resulting from buffer establishment. In 2000 the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, began an extensive cooperative venture under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to establish riparian buffers on agricultural lands, primarily through United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Prior to CREP implementation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a regionally tailored fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for use as a watershed assessment technique in Northern Virginia. Using this regional IBI framework, we evaluated the effects of recently established riparian buffers on aquatic condition. Within the geographic scope of the regional IBI, we evaluated all buffer segments planned between 2000 and 2003. Cumulatively during this period, we assessed stream physical condition on 36 buffer sites and 12 reference sites using the NRCS Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP); we also assessed the aquatic community at these sites using the IBI. Improvements in stream condition were clearly demonstrated at certain sites within one year of buffer establishment. Although not all buffer projects responded with positive trends, mean SVAP and IBI scores for buffered sites increased over the course of the study, whereas the trend on reference sites was level or slightly downward. We observed positive IBI response at sites with highly disturbed local conditions prior to buffer establishment combined with small, relatively undisturbed watersheds above. Simple solutions such as buffer establishment alone cannot be expected to protect streams from adverse human impacts that occur at a broader scale. Therefore, riparian restoration should be planned and carried out in concert with other conservation practices at a watershed scale in a way that maximizes buffer effectiveness.

AB  - Riparian buffers, the strips of vegetation along banks of rivers and streams, have been proposed as a key instrument to protect water quality in the United States. Riparian buffers impose a restriction on the use of private property limiting harvest and development, but buffers can also provide for aesthetic and recreational benefits that may accrue to property owners. With data from the Neuse River Basin in North Carolina, this study attempts to provide empirical evidence on the effect of a mandatory buffer rule on the value of riparian properties. Spatial autoregressive hedonic models are estimated within a quasi-experimental framework using the imposition of the buffer rule as the treatment and nonriparian properties as a control group. Results indicate that a riparian property generally commands a high premium. We find no evidence, however, that the mandatory buffer rule has had a significant impact on riparian property values when compared with the control group.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) levels are alarmingly high in fish from lakes across Fennoscandia and northern North America. The few published studies on the ways in which silviculture practices influence this problem indicate that forest operations increase Hg in downstream aquatic ecosystems. From these studies, we estimate that between onetenth and one-quarter of the Hg in the fish of high-latitude, managed forest landscapes can be attributed to harvesting. Forestry, however, did not create the elevated Hg levels in the soils, and waterbome Hg/MeHg concentrations downstream from harvested areas are similar to those from wetlands. Given the current understanding of the way in which silviculture impacts Hg cycling, most of the recommendations for good forest practice in Sweden appear to be appropriate for high-latitude regions, e. g., leaving riparian buffer zones, as well as reducing disturbance at stream crossings and in moist areas. The recommendation to restore wetlands and reduce drainage, however, will likely increase Hg/MeHg loadings to aquatic ecosystems.

We quantified species richness, diversity, and evenness and functional richness, diversity, and evenness of riparian and upland plants along 24 small streams subjected to a range of anthropogenic disturbances in the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario, Canada. We included a total of 36 functional traits related to productivity, competitive ability, reproduction, disturbance tolerance, life history, and tolerance to habitat instability. Using nested ANOVA, we examined the response of diversity indices to disturbance and whether it followed the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) and varied with habitat stability. We found that, like species richness and diversity, functional richness and diversity reached peaks at moderate disturbance intensity; functional diversity followed the predictions of the IDH. Second, disturbance&#x2014;habitat-stability coupling has very little effect on overall species and functional diversity, but the effect on particular life forms and functions may be significant. Since species richness and diversity patterns are context and system dependent, our findings should be most applicable to similar temperate riparian systems.

AB  - Research on best management practices, including vegetative filter strips, is needed to evaluate the potential for reducing herbicides in surface runoff. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the influence of different filter strip components on fluometuron adsorption. Samples were taken from a switchgrass filter strip (1-m wide) established on a Brooksville silty clay. Sampled components included switchgrass stems clipped to 4 cm, plant residue on the soil surface, and topsoil < 5-mm, 0.5- to 1-cm, 1- to 3-cm, and 3- to 5-cm deep. The filter strip topsoil samples contained 1.8, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.8% organic matter for the aforementioned depths, respectively, compared with 1.8% in soil collected from an adjacent cropped area. Fluometuron adsorption on each sample was compared at initial concentrations of 0.017, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg L&#x207b;&#xb9;, the last of these representing four times the peak concentration in surface runoff. Fluometuron adsorption was greater in soil from filter strip areas than in soil from cropped areas. Averaged over concentration, the soil-water partition coefficient (K d) value for soil 1- to 3-cm and 3- to 5-cm deep was greater than the value for soil from the cropped area. Stems and residue had K d values 4.9- and 4.1-fold greater, respectively, than soil from the cropped area. Average adsorption coefficients normalized for organic carbon content $(K_{{\rm oc}})$ of soil < 5-mm and 3- to 5-cm deep from filter strip areas were greater than the values for soil from cropped areas.

AB  - Filter strips are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted along agricultural field margins adjacent to streams or wetlands and are designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, and agrichemicals. Roughly 16,000 ha of filter strips have been established in Maryland through the United States Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. Filter strips often represent the only uncultivated herbaceous areas on farmland in Maryland and therefore may be important habitat for early-successional bird species. Most filter strips in Maryland are planted to either native warm-season grasses or cool-season grasses and range in width from 10.7 m to 91.4 m. From 2004 to 2007 we studied the breeding and wintering bird communities in filter strips adjacent to wooded edges and non-buffered field edges and the effect that grass type and width of filter strips had on bird community composition. We used 5 bird community metrics (total bird density, species richness, scrub-shrub bird density, grassland bird density, and total avian conservation value), species-specific densities, nest densities, and nest survival estimates to assess the habitat value of filter strips for birds. Breeding and wintering bird community metrics were greater in filter strips than in non-buffered field edges but did not differ between cool-season and warm-season grass filter strips. Most breeding bird community metrics were negatively related to the percent cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomeratd) in &#x2265;1 yr. Breeding bird density was greater in narrow (<30m) compared to wide (>60 m) filter strips. Our results suggest that narrow filter strips adjacent to wooded edges can provide habitat for many bird species but that wide filter strips provide better habitat for grassland birds, particularly obligate grassland species. If bird conservation is an objective, avoid planting orchardgrass in filter strips and reduce or eliminate orchardgrass from filter strips through management practices.

AB  - Forest and grass riparian buffers are a common conservation practice to control nonpoint source pollution. In the lower midwestern United States, there is significant interest in incorporating a once common native riparian species, giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea) in riparian restoration designs. Thus, assessing the water quality benefits of giant cane buffers is warranted. Ground water nitrate and ammonium concentrations were measured at the field edge (0 m), and 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 12.0 m from the field edge through giant cane and forest riparian buffers adjacent to agricultural fields along three streams in southern Illinois. Ground water nitrate and ammonium were not different between the giant cane and forest riparian buffers, nor were there significant reductions in these nutrients through the riparian zones when all three sites were considered. However, site-specific regressions of nutrient concentration vs. distance showed significant reductions (&gt;80%) in nitrate through two forest and one cane riparian buffers, and a significant reduction in ammonium (95%) through a cane buffer. Our results indicate that buffer effectiveness may be dependent on landscape position and water table depth.

AB  - Field margin weeds may contribute to the invasion and persistence of weeds in arable fields. Experimental studies of this hypothesis, however, have been inconclusive. We examined the role of field margin weed populations with a spatially explicit simulation model of Canada thistle population dynamics. We measured the contribution of field margin populations to weed pressure in the field across a wide range of parameter values and compared the weed control value of efforts applied to the field margin to that of similar efforts applied to the field. Under most combinations of parameter values, field margin weeds contributed little to weed pressure in the field, suggesting that controlling field margin weeds may often be of little value. Two conditions appeared to be necessary for field margin weeds to influence weed population dynamics within the field: the presence of unoccupied weed habitat, which increased the importance of dispersal to population growth, and high dispersal rates of field margin weeds relative to field weeds, which increased the relative contribution of field margin weeds to dispersal.

AB  - Ecosystem services provided by wetlands on agricultural landscapes include fish and wildlife habitat support, mitigation of pollution effects, water conservation, and climate change mitigation. Riparian buffer practices are also considered in this synthesis due to their implementation in wetlands or effects on wetland ecosystem service provisioning when implemented adjacent to wetlands. Conservation practices are most extensive in the first three of the following seven regions analyzed: Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Glaciated Interior Plains, Piedmont&#x2014;Coastal Plain, Prairie Pothole Region, California Central Valley, Appalachia, and the High Plains. Of the eight dominant practices available to establish and manage wetlands, the three most prevalent are Wetland Establishment, Wetland Management, and Riparian Buffer establishment and management. Differences in physiography among regions strongly influence the types of practices commonly applied. Highly altered drainage patterns and nutrient loading common to agriculture can make wetland establishment difficult. Nutrient enrichment, especially with nitrogen, can create trade-offs between reduced export of nutrients downstream (e.g., nitrate) and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., nitrous oxide). Guidance is needed that considers the full array of ecosystem functions and services of multiple practices across a range of spatial scales. Both positive and negative effects need to be addressed given the trade-offs between enhancement of ecosystem services and the lack of knowledge of thresholds at which ecosystem functions are no longer ecologically or economically sustainable. In many cases, data are not presently available, nor is there a suitable monitoring process in place to assess the long-term effects of agriculture on additional wetlands and the potential services they provide, and vice versa. This points to the need to better match practices with goals, to evaluate restoration costs and benefits, and to optimize how decision-making is distributed between national and local levels.

AB  - Understanding how birds respond to the activities of people is an important component of conserving wildlife. We measured responses of nesting black skimmers (Rynchops niger) to an approaching boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, by examining distance to first respond, distance to flush, and time to return to the colony. Our objective was to determine if response distances of skimmers changed as a function of year, reproductive stage, direction of approach (direct or tangential), or number of birds nesting in the colony. Generally, reproductive stage had the greatest effect on all responses, followed by direction of approach, number of adults present at the colony, number of nests, and year, which also explained variation in behavioral responses. The distance at which skimmers first flew when a boat approached decreased from the pre&#x2014;egg-laying period to hatching, and then increased slightly later in the season. Time (x&#x304; &#xb1; SE) for skimmers to return to the nesting colony varied seasonally, with birds taking longer to return during the pre-egg period (9.5 &#xb1; 0.6 min) than during hatching (0.7 &#xb1; 0.1 min). The decision process for determining set-back distances to protect nesting skimmers should involve selecting 1) behavioral response of highest concern, 2) reproductive stage of highest concern, and 3) an appropriate level of response at which to establish the buffer area. We recommend that managers use a set-back distance of &#x2265;118 m from the perimeter of the colony for black skimmers, which is the 95% percentile of the distance that skimmers first flew in response to approaching boats. Managers can use these data to set buffer distances for skimmers and other colonial birds.

AB  - Because freshwater wetlands often support diverse and unique species assemblages, wetland loss is a primary concern in biological conservation. U.S. federal statutes protect many wetlands by deterring development within delineated borders that segregate wetland habitats from upland regions. In addition, some state and local jurisdictions mandate buffer zones that afford varying levels of protection to upland habitats adjacent to wetlands. We used geographic information system analysis to test the adequacy of federal and state wetland protection statutes by determining the degree to which protected acreage encompassed the habitats freshwater turtles needed to complete their life cycles. Two critical life-cycle stages, nesting and terrestrial hibernation, occurred exclusively beyond wetland boundaries delineated under federal guidelines. The most stringent state buffer zone insulated 44% of nest and hibernation sites. Our data indicate that the freshwater turtles examined in this study required a 275-m upland buffer zone to protect 100% of the nest and hibernation sites. Insulating 90% of the sites required a 73-m buffer zone. We suggest that the habitat needs of freshwater turtles demonstrate the dependence of wetland biodiversity on the preservation of adequate amounts of upland habitats adjacent to wetlands.

AB  - AbstractRestoration of riparian vegetation is widely recognized as a tool in stream rehabilitation, but information on whether local riparian characteristics can mitigate the effects of catchment-level stressors on in-stream processes is limited. We measured community metabolism in 21 streams in the Canterbury region of New Zealand along 2 independent gradients of agricultural intensity and riparian cover (from closed canopied to open canopied) to assess relative effects of landscape and local factors on stream trophic state. We measured stream metabolism with the single-station open-channel diel O2 method. We found a correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), indicating a gradient of trophic states across sites. Streams were strongly heterotrophic with P&#x2236;R values varying from 0.01 to 0.25. GPP and ER increased with % agriculture and % macrophyte cover, but decreased with % shade from riparian vegetation. Hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that % agriculture was the only landuse variable to have a significant independent effect on GPP and ER. Among local variables, % shade and % macrophyte cover had significant independent effects on GPP. Percent shade was the only local variable to have a significant independent effect on ER. Percent shade had a stronger effect on both GPP and ER than did % agriculture, and a trade-off exists between the importance of agricultural and forest cover on stream metabolism at different spatial scales. Our results highlight the role of local riparian conditions in controlling trophic state and the importance of riparian buffers as a tool to mitigate eutrophication in streams and rivers.

AB  - As part of The Mountain Institute's monitoring and evaluation program, historic landscape photographs from 10 photopoints of the 1936 and 1939 German/Austrian climbing and cartographic expeditions to the Cordillera Blanca (Huascar&#xe1;n National Park) were replicated in 1997 and 1998. Comparisons revealed contemporary changes in native forest cover, nonnative forest cover, glacial recession, grazing impacts, and urban expansion. Results indicated an apparent stability and/or increase in native Polylepis forest cover, significant regional increases in nonnative Eucalyptus and Pinus forest cover, improved pasture conditions in some areas, widespread glacial recession, and increases in regional urbanization. Important management-related questions in need of further study are identified, such as the impacts of cattle on Polylepis regeneration, correlations between road construction and forest loss, long-term impacts of nonnative forests, and strategies for the reintroduction of native forest species. Increasing the photographic, quantitative, and oral databases for the Huascar&#xe1;n National Park and buffer zone will continue to provide important insights regarding contemporary landscape change processes, human versus natural impacts, and future management and restoration options.

A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used to evaluate 2 montane riparian communities as filters for removing ${\rm NO}_{3}{}^{-}\text{-}{\rm N},{\rm NH}_{4}{}^{+}\text{-}{\rm N}$, and ${\rm PO}_{4}{}^{-3}\text{-}$P nutrients from sediment laden overland flow water. One riparian community was characterized by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) Beauv.), while the second community was dominated by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata Stokes) and water sedge (Carex aquatilus Wahl.). Three vegetation height treatments were evaluated: control (natural condition), moderate treatment (clipped to 10-cm height and clipped material removed), and heavy treatment (clipped to ground level, clipped material removed, and litter vacuumed up). A 10-m wide riparian buffer zone was an efficient filter as about 84% ${\rm NO}_{3}{}^{-}\text{-}{\rm N}$ and 79% ${\rm PO}_{4}{}^{-3}\text{-}{\rm P}$ was removed from the applied water and sediment. However, there were no consistent differences among specific vegetation height treatments or communities in the removal of N and P nutrients. /// Se formulo la hip&#xf3;tesis de que el tipo y altura de la vegetaci&#xf3;n ribere&#xf1;a podr&#xed;a afectar su capacidad para filtrar y retener nitrogeno inorg&#xe1;nico [nitrato $({\rm NO}_{3}{}^{-}\text{-}{\rm N})$ y amonio $({\rm NH}_{4}{}^{+}\text{-}{\rm N})$] y f&#xf3;sforo inorg&#xe1;nico [fosfato $({\rm PO}_{4}{}^{-3}\text{-}{\rm P})$].

AB  - 1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes.

AB  - The management of field margin strips for the enhancement of biodiversity of plant-insect communities and natural-enemy populations was studied on experimental farms near G&#xf6;ttingen (Germany). Young and old, sown and naturally developed field margin strips were compared and differences to large fallows established. The five types of field margin strips (around cereal fields) were: (1, 2) 1- or 6-year-old naturally developed strips, (3) strips sown with a Phacelia mixture, (4) strips sown with a mixture of 19 wild flower species, and (5) strips sown with winter wheat or oat as a control. The naturally developed vegetation of the field margin strips was dominated by aggressive weeds, presumably due to the intensive farming practices and the fertile soils. Cirsium arvense populations decreased, while Elymus repens populations increased with age of habitat. Sowings were suitable to suppress these aggressive weeds. Potted plants of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) were exposed in the field margin strips to study arthropod colonization of these experimentally standardized plant patches. Arthropod species richness did not differ between field margin types, reflecting the overall similarity in floristic diversity, but sprayed and strip-free edges of cereal fields had a reduced diversity. Dispersal of insect populations of red clover into the cereal fields decreased with increasing distance, but benefited from adjacent field margin strips. Populations of predators (mainly spiders) as well as predator-prey ratios were significantly larger in 6-year-old than in 1-year-old strips emphasizing the importance of habitat age for natural enemies and possible biological control. Predator-prey ratios were also higher on old than young fallows. Large fallows had greater predator-prey ratios than small field margin strips emphasizing the trophic-level hypothesis of island biogeography in that the relative importance of natural enemies increased with habitat area. Insect species richness was only marginally influenced by area and not by age. As species richness of predators did not increase with area and age, species diversity and the possible biological-control function did not covary.

AB  - Tall fescue vegetative filter strips 0.5 to 4.0 m wide were evaluated for their ability to reduce losses of metolachlor, metribuzin, and runoff (water and sediment) in conventionally tilled soybean. Differences in the parameters studied were significant between filter and no filter strips, regardless of filter strip width. Two days after treatment, metribuzin concentration in runoff from the unfiltered treatment was 231 ng ml&#x207b;&#xb9;; filter strips reduced this amount to 119 ng ml&#x207b;&#xb9; or less. Similar trends were observed with metolachlor, with concentrations of 1,009 ng ml&#x207b;&#xb9; from the unfiltered, whereas filter strips of any width reduced this to 523 ng ml&#x207b;&#xb9; or less. Metribuzin loss during the growing season was 41 g ai ha&#x207b;&#xb9;, or 9.8% of the amount applied when no filter strip was present. The addition of a filter strip, regardless of width, reduced cumulative metribuzin losses to 11 g ha&#x207b;&#xb9; or less. Similar results were noted with metolachlor. Filter strips, regardless of width, reduced cumulative runoff and sediment loss at least 46 and 83%, respectively.

AB  - We sampled amphibians on 3 red alder (Alnus rubra) sites 1 year before and 1 and 2 years after the following treatments were applied to each site: (1) control (uncut), (2) clearcut and broadcast burned, and (3) clearcut, broadcast burned, and then sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate. All sites included uncut riparian buffer strips. For 3 of the 6 species with &#x2265;20 captures in pitfall traps, we did not detect changes in capture rates after clearcutting. Capture rates of ensatinas (Ensatina eschscholtzii) and Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) decreased after logging. Capture rates of western redback salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum) increased the first year after logging, probably because the salamanders sheltered in pitfalls, but effects on populations were unclear. Logging did not significantly alter capture rates of rough-skin newts (Taricha granulosa), Dunn's salamanders (P. dunni), and red-legged frogs (Rana aurora). Planning the location and timing of clearcuts or other silvicultural practices over a landscape and retaining riparian buffer strips may be necessary to ensure long-term persistence of Pacific giant salamanders. We did not detect any effects of herbicide spraying on capture rates. Capture rates for rough-skin newts and red-legged frogs were higher in uncut red alder stands than in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands sampled in other studies, an indication that, when red alder stands are converted to Douglas-fir, some alders should be left adjacent to streams to provide habitat for these species and other hardwood associates.

AB  - Conversion of hardwood stands to conifers is a common practice in the Oregon Coast Range, but little is known of the effect on small mammals. We sampled small mammals on 3 replicate red alder (Alnus rubra) sites 1 year before and 2 years after the application of forest management treatments. On each site, 1 unit each was (1) left uncut (control), (2) clearcut and broadcast burned, and (3) clearcut and broadcast burned and then sprayed with glyphosate herbicide. All sites included uncut riparian buffer strips at least 20 m wide. In upslope areas, capture rates of creeping voles (Microtus oregoni; P < 0.001) and vagrant shrews (Sorex vagrans; P = 0.005) increased after logging, while capture rates of Pacific shrews (S. pacificus; P < 0.02) and Trowbridge's shrews (S. trowbridgii; P = 0.006) decreased. For Townsend's chipmunk (Tamias townsendii), capture rates increased in the buffer areas after logging (P < 0.02). Capture rates for deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) did not differ among treatments (P > 0.20). Capture rates of the shrew species that declined did not decrease in the buffer areas, indicating riparian buffer strips may support populations of these species up to 2 years after logging. For the 6 species analyzed, changes in capture rates did not differ between areas sprayed with glyphosate and logged, unsprayed areas (Ps > 0.15).

AB  - La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve&#x2014;created in 1995 in Chiapas, Mexico&#x2014;is well known for its biodiversity. Its buffer zone, harboring the upper &#x201c;Tabl&#xf3;n&#x201d; river basin, has been intensively managed by peasants for 48 years. We carried out interviews with cattle producers at the Los &#xc1;ngeles ejido, coupled with field surveys of vegetation presence, to determine the nature and allocation of different vegetation associations and their relation to indicators of tree regeneration (sapling presence). Our data showed that 96% of the producers surveyed owned areas with open pastures, and 83% owned at least 1 patch of forested pastures where cattle browse. For oak-forested pastures, the results suggest a trend of high sapling presence with high tree cover. In contrast, for deciduous pastures, the results suggest a trend of high sapling presence with intermediate tree cover. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that woody vegetation within grazing areas may facilitate natural tree recruitment around reserves. Furthermore, these vegetation cover results suggest that within the pasturelands found today in the Los &#xc1;ngeles ejido, some ranchers may be inadvertently conducting practices that are consistent with agro-silvo-pastoral systems.

AB  - This paper explores the development of a so-called asylum 'buffer zone' around the eastern frontiers of the west European region as a result of the Schengen, EU and EFTA member states' introduction of more restrictive asylum policies during the first half of the 1990s. Restrictive policies in western Europe are forcing central and east European states into a 'buffer role', obliging them to absorb asylum-seekers who fail to gain entry into western Europe and/or restrict asylum-seekers' access to the borders of potential 'receiving' states. In addition to examining the mechanisms by which this 'buffer zone' is developing and questioning what it might mean for future asylum trends and policies in Europe, the paper considers the wider questions raised by this development in relation to the changing geopolitical landscape of Europe, particularly in relation to the changing political and security relations between western, central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

AB  - 1. Vegetative buffers in agricultural landscapes can provide a range of important ecological services, including conservation of native flora and fauna, enhancement of biological pest control and reduction of agrochemical drift. Typically, studies addressing the impact of such vegetative elements focus on one particular benefit. We investigated whether the benefits of field margins that had been established for conservation of northern bobwhite quail Colinus virginianus populations extended to the enhancement of biological pest control in adjacent conservation tillage cotton fields. 2. Densities of a selection of insect species and the predation and parasitism rates of insect pest species were measured in first- and second-year field margins established for bobwhite quail as well as in an adjacent cotton crop. 3. Second-year field margins yielded higher densities of all species sampled, with the exception of staphylinids and cotton aphids. Despite this, thrips and their predator, Orius insidiosus, were the only species that were also more abundant in the adjacent cotton field. Tachinids and Trichogramma and Lygus species, appeared to prefer the field margin vegetation over the cotton. 4. Overall, the impact of second-year margins on the cotton crop did not significantly differ from first-year margins with regard to pest occurrence or biological control. 5. Analysis of the sugar content in Meteorus autographae, a generalist parasitoid of Lepidoptera larvae, suggested that this species is severely food-limited in the field margins established for bobwhite quail. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field margins designed to specifically benefit bobwhite quail may be unsuitable for providing other ecological services. By making small adjustments in the vegetative composition of these field margins, such as adding early season nectar-producing plants, it may be feasible to combine biodiversity and pest-control benefits and thereby optimize the overall ecological services to be gained.

AB  - AbstractUrbanization is degrading stream ecosystems worldwide. Tropical island streams may respond to urbanization differently than temperate streams because of their overall climate differences, and they may respond differently than continental tropical urban streams because of their reduced biological diversity and short drainages. We characterized the physicochemistry, physical habitat, and macroinvertebrate assemblages of 16 stream tributaries in the Rio Piedras Watershed (San Juan, Puerto Rico). We also described landuse patterns upstream from each sampling site for the entire subwatershed and for riparian buffers of 5- and 100-m width. Urbanization had a negative effect on the physicochemical and biological condition of the Rio Piedras. Streams were distributed in ordination space along a strong physicochemical gradient that was related to concentrations of K+, Mg2+, dissolved O2 (DO), and PO43&#x2212;. Along this gradient, DO and Mg2+ decreased and PO43&#x2212; and K+ increased with higher % urban cover in the subwatershed. Macroinvertebrate assemblages also were related to urbanization, and more macroinvertebrate families and pollution-sensitive taxa were found at sites where physicochemistry reflected less urban cover. Family richness and pollution-sensitive taxa were positively associated with greater % forest cover in the 5-m riparian buffer zone, a result that supports the use of riparian buffers to ameliorate the effects of urbanization on stream biointegrity in the Rio Piedras. Our results are similar to findings in urban streams in temperate zones and in tropical continental streams. Therefore, despite island characteristics, tropical island stream physicochemistry and macroinvertebrate assemblages responded to urbanization in ways that are in general agreement with the predictions of the Urban Stream Syndrome.

AB  - In the eastern U.S. Coastal Plain and Piedmont region, diverse inland wetlands (riverine, depressional, wet flats) have been impacted by or converted to agriculture. Farm Bill conservation practices that restore or enhance wetlands can return their ecological functions and services to the agricultural landscape. We review the extent of regional knowledge regarding the effectiveness of these conservation practices. Riparian buffers and wetland habitat management have been the most commonly applied wetland-related practices across the region. Riparian Forest Buffers (RFB) have been most studied as a practice. Water quality functions including pollutant removal, provision of aquatic habitat, and enhanced instream chemical processing have been documented from either installed RFBs or natural riparian forests; forest buffers also serve wildlife habitat functions that depend in part on buffer width and connectivity. Wetland restoration/creation and habitat management practices have been less studied on regional agricultural lands; however, research on mitigation wetlands suggests that functional hydrology, vegetation, and faunal communities can be restored in depressional wetlands, and the wetland habitat management practices represent techniques adapted from those used successfully on wildlife refuges. Other conservation practices can also support wetland services. Drainage management on converted wetland flats restores some water storage functions, and viable wetlands can persist within grazed flats if livestock access and grazing are managed appropriately. Because wetland hydrogeomorphic type influences functions, ecosystem services from conservation wetlands will depend on the specifics of how practices are implemented. In a region of diverse wetlands, evaluation of ecological benefits could be improved with more information on the wetland types restored, created, and managed.

Field experiments, designed to investigate the transport of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphate from areas of confined livestock activity, as influenced by flow characteristics and filter strip length, were conducted. Results indicated that VFS are effective for the removal of sediment and other suspended solids contained in surface runoff from feedlots if runoff is shallow and uniform; effectiveness of VFS for sediment removal decreases with time as sediment accumulates within the filters; total nitrogen and phosphorus are not removed as effectively as sediment; and soluble nitrogen and phosphorus are not removed effectively.

AB  - 1. Uncropped field margins are important foraging habitats on farmland for many declining bird species and are a key component of Agri-Environment Schemes across Europe. Maximizing the value of foraging habitats requires detailed knowledge of the factors influencing habitat selection and food availability. 2. We firstly conducted an observational study of foraging habitat selection by breeding yellowhammers Emberiza citrinella L. on lowland mixed farmland, in relation to underlying invertebrate and vegetation characteristics. 3. There was a clear seasonal shift in the relative use of field margins and cereal crops. Margins were used less than crops in late summer, despite supporting higher invertebrate abundance relative to cereals. Seasonal increases in vegetation height were most marked in margins, suggesting the seasonal decline in margin use may reflect reduced food accessibility. 4. In the second phase of the study, field margins were cut experimentally to create short, open patches within taller margin swards. The use of cut patches by foraging yellowhammers increased significantly between early and late summer, and patches were used more frequently with increasing height of adjacent uncut margin. These findings strongly support the theory that tall vegetation reduces margin accessibility in late summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Provision of invertebrate-rich field margins is a core component of Agri-Environment Schemes, but current prescriptions may result in them having limited value in late summer. More effective management, such as more frequent cutting, may be required to maximize the benefits for foraging birds by creating short, open vegetation patches. Measures to increase accessibility to invertebrates on farmland are likely to benefit a range of bird species across a variety of crop types.

AB  - Deforestation of riparian zones is known to influence the numbers and kinds of organisms that inhabit adjoining streams, but little quantitative information is available on how much deforestation must occur before the biota isaffected. We sampled fishes and stream habitats in 12 stream segments downstream from deforested but vegetated riparian patches 0-5.3 km long, all downslope from watersheds with at least 95% forest cover. We found an overall decrease in fish abundance with increasing length of nonforested riparian patch; sculpins, benthic minnows, and darters decreased, and sunfishes and water-column minnows increased in numbers. Introduced species were more common downstream from longer riparian patches. Habitat diversity decreased and riffles became filled with fine sediments as upstream patch length increased. Length of upstream nonforested patch and substrate particle size were much stronger predictors of fish occurrence than riparian patch width. Faunal characteristics and physical features of the stream changed in direct proportion to the gradient of riparian disturbance, but the abundance of several species underwent pronounced change at particular threshold patch lengths. These results suggest that riparian forest removal leads to shifts in the structure of stream fish assemblages due to (1) decreases in fish species that do not guard hidden eggs or that are dependent on swift, shallow water that flows over relatively sediment-free substrates, or (2) increases in fishes that guard their young in pebble or pit nests or that live in slower, deeper water. When watershed development is anticipated or planned, limited clearing of riparian trees may cause minor disturbance to the fish assemblage, but streams in even a heavily forested watershed with vegetated riparian buffers cannot tolerate disruption of riparian-zone trees over much more than 1 km in length. Riparian buffer length and area should be given stronger consideration in stream protection and restoration plans.

AB  - Anthropologists have described, but seldom explained, the existence and persistence of common pool resource systems among hunting and gathering populations. Land tenure practices in the Fort Irwin area of the Mojave desert, California are explored. Ecological, ethnographic, archeological, and ethnohistoric information suggests that this area was jointly owned and intermittently used by several distinct ethnic groups. Although the region was important as a buffer against resource shortfall during certain seasons, sporadic use and meager and variable resource yield may have made exclusive ownership difficult and costly. A jointly managed region with common pool resources better served surrounding groups, while simultaneously creating a spatial buffer to diffuse social tensions. Following presentation of the Fort Irwin case, the paper considers the formation of such land tenure practices among hunting and gathering populations.

AB  - The problem of supporting decision- and policy-makers in managing issues related to solid waste and water quality was addressed within the context of a participatory modeling framework in the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone in Nepal. We present the main findings of management-oriented research projects conducted within this framework, thus providing an overview of the current situation in the park regarding solid waste and water quality issues. We found that most of the solid waste generated in the park is composed of organic matter, paper, and minor reused waste that is mainly reused for cattle feeding and manure, while disposal of other nondegradable categories of collected waste (glass, metal, and plastic) is not properly managed. Particularly, burning or disposal in open dumps poses a great hazard to environmental, human, and animal health, as most dump sites situated close to water courses are prone to regular flooding during the rainy season, thereby directly contaminating river water. Pollutants and microbiological contamination in water bodies were found and anthropogenic activities and hazardous practices such as solid waste dump sites, open defecation, and poor conditions of existing septic tanks are suggested as possibly affecting water quality. Collection of these data on solid waste and water quality and compilation of management information on the targeted social-ecological system allowed us to develop consensusbuilding models to be used as management supporting tools. By implementing such models, we were able to simulate scenarios identifying and evaluating possible management solutions and interventions in the park. This work reveals insights into general dynamics that can support the quest for solutions to waste and water quality management problems in other protected areas and mountain landscapes where traditional livelihood and land use patterns are changing under the influence of a growing population, changing consumption patterns, and international tourism.

AB  - Metolachlor and metribuzin loss in runoff was determined in three soybean tillage systems with and without a 4 by 2 m tall fescue vegetative filter strip. Soil erosion plots were 4 by 22 m with 3% slope. Regression analysis was used to describe herbicide concentration in runoff, and to determine if vegetative filter strips reduced herbicide concentration. Analysis of covariance indicated no difference in concentration of metolachlor or metribuzin in runoff from the three tillage systems within any vegetative filter strip treatment. Metolachlor loss in 1991 was highest from the no-till monocrop without a vegetative filter strip, and it was 65 g ha&#x207b;&#xb9; or approximately 2% of the amount applied. In 1992 and 1993, the no-till doublecrop had a total loss of 120 and 147 g ha&#x207b;&#xb9;, respectively, approximately 4% of the amount applied. Similar results were noted with metribuzin, but total loss was as high as 46 g ha&#x207b;&#xb9; or 11% of the amount applied in 1993 from a no-till doublecrop system without a vegetative filter strip. When a vegetative filter strip was present, losses of metribuzin and metolachlor were reduced over 85% in 1993, and totaled 1.2 and 0.5%, respectively, of the amount applied. The vegetative filter strip reduced herbicide and suspended solids from runoff produced by a conventional-till production system to levels equal to or lower than a no-till doublecrop system.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips for controlling sediment generated from the bare ground (i.e., ground not protected by mulch or plant cover) were studied. Plots consisted of a 4.6-m clean-tilled upslope sediment source area and a 12.2-m vegetative filter strip located downslope from the sediment source area. Vegetative filter strips consisted of pure stands of six adapted cool season grasses and two cereal grains. Sediment-laden runoff was transported into the upslope edge of each filter strip. Runoff samples were collected from the lower end of each plot and analyzed for nonflow weighted sediment concentration. The rate of advance of water through each vegetative filter strip was measured. Additional measurements were made to define the plant characteristics of each vegetative filter strip species. In general, planted vegetative filter strips resulted in a 68% reduction in concentration of sediment in initial runoff from a 50-year, 24-hour storm event on prewetted soil. Crested wheatgrass and smooth bromegrass vegetative filter strips reduced water flow velocity an average of 217% compared with the clean-tilled control plot. The length of time that water remained in the vegetative filter strip modestly correlated with average sediment concentration in runoff that was 5.5 g/L and 5.0 g/L, respectively, compared with the control plot, which yielded 16.3 g of sediment/L of runoff. Under dry soil conditions, sediment concentration in runoff from bromegrass and crested wheatgrass was reduced by an average of 85% compared with the bare control plot. Length of time for water to advance through the smooth bromegrass and crested wheatgrass vegetative filter strips increased an average of 325% compared with the length of time required to flow through the clean-tilled bare strip.

AB  - A river basin is similar to a watershed, but it is much larger in area. The Mississippi River Basin, Colorado River Basin, and Salt River Basin include all of the lands that drain through these rivers and their tributaries. River basins contain upland watershed lands and large downstream drainage areas. Water and entrained sediment and chemicals connect upland watersheds and large river basins as they flow from one into the other. The upland watersheds in the Salt-Verde River Basin in north-central Arizona and the reservoirs of the Salt River Project, which is one of the oldest reclamation projects in the western United States, illustrate the water-flow connection between upland watersheds and a large river basin.

AB  - We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of breeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were significantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Numbers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed elsewhere. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small- and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.

AB  - Litter cover is known to protect ground surfaces from raindrop impact and therefore reduces soil erosion. Significant differences were found to exist in the abundance, composition and size of trees, in their litter production rates, and in the resulting potential for soil erosion of the foreshore (0&#x2014;20 m from shorelines) compared with the backshore (20&#x2014;50 m upslope) regions of riparian zones around four boreal lakes located in northwestern Ontario, Canada. These findings support a global pattern wherein litter production adjacent to waterbodies is often considerably reduced compared with that characteristic of upland forests. This study therefore raises questions of the presumed effectiveness of existing forestry guidelines concerning widths of protective buffer strips around boreal, coldwater lakes in Ontario, which are presently based on an erroneous assumption of uniform tree cover and litterfall throughout riparian zones.

AB  - This paper presents the results of managementoriented research on energy, forest, and human health issues in a remote mountain area, the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ), Nepal. The research was based on a broader, integrated participatory framework ultimately intended for use in adaptive management. The present study focused on the application of a participatory modeling framework to address problems related to energy demand and consumption, forest condition, and indoor air pollution, which were defined by the stakeholders as important issues to be addressed. The models were developed using a generalizing design that allows for user-friendly adaptation to other contexts (free download at http://hkkhpartnership.org). Moreover, we simulated management scenarios in collaboration with all modeling actors with the aim of building consensus on the understanding of the system as well as supporting decisionmakers' capacity not only to respond to changes, but also to anticipate them. Importantly, the system dynamics assessment found that the SNPBZ forests are affected by an increasing demand for fuelwood (occurring due to tourism growth), as one of the main sources of energy. Selected forests show an average reduction of 38% in forest biomass from 1992 to 2008. This shows that the business-as-usual scenario is unlikely to result in the preservation of the current forest status; in fact, such preservation would require 75% of fuelwood to be replaced with alternative energy sources. At the same time, a 75% reduction of fuelwood use (and an 80% reduction of dung use) would reduce indoor carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations to the standard limits for CO exposure set by the World Health Organization.

AB  - River floodplain landscapes are diverse and dynamic, yet little is known about long-term changes in land-cover patterns in these systems. We quantified floodplain land-cover change between the 1930s and the 1990s along nine 12-21-km reaches of the Wisconsin River by analyzing and digitally classifying 200 historic aerial photos corrected against modern orthophotographs. Several metrics of landscape structure were used to determine changes in amount and connectivity of deciduous forest, wetlands, grassland, and agriculture within the 100-yr floodplain. Deciduous forest increased by up to 51% between the 1930s and the 1990s. However, number of patches declined, and edge density increased in almost every reach, indicating that amount and connectivity of forest cover increased but that forest patches became more complex in shape. Grasslands declined, and the number, edge density, and mean size of grassland patches illustrated a progression to fewer, smaller, isolated remnants. Wetland patch dynamics demonstrated complex and divergent patterns, as wetland cover decreased in northern reaches, increased in patch density but not mean patch size in the central region, and increased in both patch density and patch size in the south. Agricultural areas declined in eight of nine reaches, and tended to fragment into fewer, smaller patches. These trends underscore a complicated and dynamic pattern of landscape change over a relatively short time scale. We explored realistic conservation scenarios to determine how disparate strategies would affect floodplain forest connectivity in four of the study reaches. One approach filled gaps in the buffer zone immediately adjacent to the river channel; the other reverted small or large agricultural patches to forest cover. Filling buffer zone gaps resulted in dramatic changes in forest connectivity in one half of the reaches, whereas greatest forest connectivity was gained by reverting agricultural patches to forest in the other half of the reaches. These scenarios emphasize that the way that forest conservation occurs (e.g., filling gaps vs. patch conversion) is just as significant as how much land is actually protected, and the ideal management option must be tailored to the specific land-cover arrangements of a given river reach. In addition to evaluating changes in forest connectivity, the number of landowners that would be affected by conservation strategies was determined. Greatest increases in forest connectivity under the buffer scenarios involved from 15 to 21 different landowners, whereas the greatest increases under the reversion scenarios affected from 14 (using several large agricultural parcels) to 67 (using many small parcels) landowners. Thus the number of landowners affected by different management scenarios represents a critical constraint on idealized conservation plans. Such scenarios may prove useful in floodplain management and facilitate synthesis of ecological research and land management.

AB  - Irregularly disturbed forests surrounding crop fields in agricultural landscapes often serve as ecological buffers that separate undesirable agricultural elements such as agrichemicals and weedy species from adjacent ecosystems. However, the nature of this interface between fields and forests remains little studied, particularly within the context of how species composition changes with field distance and how far exotic species penetrate into forest interiors. In three agricultural landscapes in the North Carolina Piedmont, we surveyed plant communities in multi-scale, nested quadrats arrayed along transects perpendicular to field boundaries and penetrating &gt;200 m into adjacent forests. Rates of species turnover, patterns of species richness, and the distribution of exotic species were assessed for 18 transects. Plant communities exhibited high rates of compositional turnover within 50 m of field boundaries, but species turnover was considerably reduced beyond this threshold. Vegetation composition within borders immediately adjacent to cornfields was dominated by a relatively predictable set of weedy forb and graminoid species, of which a substantial proportion was exotic. Composition of surrounding forest communities more reflected local environmental conditions and contained few exotic species overall. Species richness was not influenced by field proximity. We suggest that agricultural influences on landscape-scale vegetation patterns are most apparent in plant communities located very close (&lt;50 m) to continuous agricultural operations. Although weed communities associated with agricultural management are represented by a large pool of exotic species, relatively few of these species are able to penetrate forest boundaries.

AB  - Abstract. The Neotropical Region has experienced large habitat transformations as a result of intensified agriculture. These changes have affected the populations of many species of birds in the Espinal ecoregion of Argentina. However, relationships between birds and agriculture in the neotropics are poorly known. We assessed the effects of crops and field margins in an area of agriculture typical for the Espinal ecoregion on the structure of the bird community, and we assessed the value of this habitat for species of conservation concern. Birds and vegetation were sampled in and along the margins of fields of soybean (the most widespread crop) and alfalfa. Twenty-five of the 41 species recorded&#x2014;including all the species of conservation concern&#x2014;were found almost exclusively in field margins; only five species occurred almost exclusively in within the fields. All other species were found in both margins and fields. Density, richness, and diversity were much greater on the margins than in the fields. Bird density in soy fields was lower than in alfalfa. Bird richness and diversity in the two crops, however, did not differ. Density in field margins increased with the cover and height of trees and shrubs. Most of the field-margin species were woodland-border species, but the species of conservation concern were all associated with grassy field margins. Because further declines in the populations of these threatened species are expected, their conservation in agricultural areas would benefit from a broad policy of habitat-conservation plans for field margins such as those practiced in North America and Europe.

AB  - We used artificial nests to examine predation in riparian buffer strips created by commercial clear-cutting and in unharvested control areas on industrial forestlands in eastern Maine. Nests in riparian buffer strips were depredated more often than those in intact riparian forests. This pattern was similar for both ground and shrub nests and for both trials. Predation rate for nests in control stands was 15%, compared to 31% in 20-40m wide buffer strips along tributary streams (P = 0.016) and 23% in 60-80m wide buffer strips along mainstem streams (P = 0.045). Predation rates were similar (P = 0.41) in mainstem and tributary buffer strips. Greater predation rates documented for nests in riparian buffer strips likely resulted from an elevated number and diversity of predators associated with the narrow, linear forest stands. Remotely-triggered cameras placed on a subset of nests revealed 6 species of nest predators. Predators identified at nests were mostly forest species and not species directly associated with riparian habitats. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) were responsible for >50% of the identified depredations. Black bears (Ursus americanus) were photographed only in tributary buffer strips and may have been using them to travel between larger forested stands. Increased predation of eggs and young probably reduces the nesting success of birds in riparian buffer strips. Managers should leave wide (&#x2265;150-m) buffer strips along riparian zones to reduce edge-related nest predation, especially in landscapes where buffer strips are an important component of the existing mature forest.

AB  - The goals of current management practices in riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest include protecting and maintaining habitat for terrestrial wildlife. However, little is known about the use of riparian buffers by terrestrial wildlife, particularly how buffer width may affect abundance and species composition of wildlife communities. In this study, I compared bird assemblages in logged and unlogged riparian areas along headwater streams and assessed the relations between bird abundance and riparian buffer width. The abundances of 4 species of forest-associated birds that were more abundant in unlogged than in logged headwater riparian stands (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], chestnut-backed chickadee [Poecile rufescens], winter wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) increased with increasing width of riparian buffers. However, 4 other species that also were more abundant in unlogged than logged riparian stands (Hammond's flycatcher [Empidonax hammondii], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], varied thrush [Ixoreus naevius], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]) were rarely observed in even the widest buffers sampled (40-70 m on 1 side of the stream). Although riparian buffers along headwater streams are not expected to support all bird species found in unlogged riparian areas, they are likely to provide the most benefit for forest-associated bird species if they are >40 m wide, and density of large trees within buffers is not reduced by harvesting.

AB  - Previous freshwater mussel surveys conducted in Copper Creek showed a decline in the fauna from 1980 to 1998. In 2004 and 2005, we sampled 47 sites acquiring relative abundance estimates (measured in catch-per-unit-effort) to assess the current status of the mussel fauna relative to previous surveys. We also obtained absolute density estimates for 4 select sites for comparison with future and past surveys. Of the 25 mussel species reported from this and previous surveys, 16 were represented by living specimens, 5 are extant but may soon be extirpated, and 8 are likely extirpated from the creek. Presence-absence analysis showed a significant decline in species per site since 1980. Absolute density estimates (at Copper Creek river km 3.1) decreased significantly from 4.07 mussels/m&#xb2; in 1981 to 0.63 mussels/m&#xb2; in 2005. The cause of this faunal decline is likely due to several factors, including, most notably, the loss of riparian buffers. Nearly half of the stream banks in Copper Creek have inadequate riparian vegetation to provide even minimal sediment control. Precipitous declines of the Clinch River fauna (a likely source population for several species) may be another significant factor influencing the faunal decline in Copper Creek. Despite these declines, populations of several species may be in a state of recovery. Based on 18 comparable sites, average catch-per-unit-effort in 2005 was 25.16 mussels/hr, significantly higher than the 1998 survey (12.92 mussels/hr).

AB  - We examined response of breeding bird communities to forest harvest that removed varying amounts of tree basal area from riparian buffers on a 2- to 4-m-wide stream in northern Minnesota, USA. We compared bird species and communities in 30-m-wide riparian buffers along the stream. Buffers were established within plots in which upland forests were clear-cut (basal area 2 m2/ha) according to standard local forest management practice. Buffers had 4 treatments (3 plots/treatment): (1) no harvest (riparian control); (2) reduction of basal area to an average of 7-10 m2/ha; (3) reduction of basal area to an average of 2 m2/ha (defined as a clear-cut); and (4) control (no harvest in either riparian buffer or adjacent upland). Bird surveys were conducted 1 year prior to harvest and for 4 years after harvest.Results revealed a significant response of the bird community to varying amounts of tree basal area retention in the riparian area. Univariate (analysis of variance) and multivariate (principal response curves [PRC]) analyses showed that in the first year after harvest, bird community composition in the riparian buffers changed in all 3 treatments relative to the control plots, and continued to diverge over time. More species and individuals, primarily those species associated with edge or early-successional habitats, colonized the harvested riparian buffers after treatment. In contrast, the number of birds and species that inhabit interior forests declined in the riparian buffers. Results suggest that any amount of harvest in riparian buffers next to clear-cut upland forest will affect breeding bird communities along small headwater streams. Because individual bird species are differentially affected by riparian forest harvest, management should consider the desired future condition of the forest and choose a harvest prescription to benefit the desired avifauna community.

AB  - The simultaneous influence from multiple edges on remnant forest patches (such as wildlife corridors, protection buffers, small unharvested remnants or corners of larger patches) in harvested forest landscapes could impair, or possibly enhance, their effectiveness. When multiple edges are in close proximity, there may be interactions of edge influence such that the observed response is greater or less than would result from the influence of either edge alone. We examined possible ways in which two nearby forest edges of similar or different types might interact in terms of their influence on forest structure. We present an 'edge interaction' model for three possible types of interaction of edge influence: (1) no interaction, edge influence is limited to the strongest influence from either edge, (2) positive interaction, observed edge influence is greater than from either edge alone; (3) negative interaction or resistance, the influence from both edges is less than from a single edge (e.g., an older edge is resistant to effects from a younger edge). Empirical data for forest structure at the edges of cutblocks (harvested areas) and water bodies were entered into the models to predict edge influence in narrow forest corridors assuming the null hypothesis of no interaction. Randomization tests were used to compare predictions to observed edge influence on recently-fallen logs and Populus spp. (P. tremuloides Michx. and P. balsamifera L.) sapling density in lakeshore buffers in boreal mixedwood forest as well as on canopy cover and log, tree and snag abundance in riparian buffers and forested corridors separating cutblocks in Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP. forest. In lakeshore buffers, there was evidence of both positive and negative interaction at different locations within the buffer or at different times since buffer creation for both the abundance of logs and Populus sapling density. Trends suggested positive interaction for canopy cover and live tree density in riparian buffers and cutblock separators, and for snag density near the cut edges of riparian buffers. Testing hypotheses arising from our model of interaction of edge influence could lead to a clearer understanding of edge influence in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Field margins are susceptible to agro-chemical spray drift, and the effects of herbicide on spiders in semi-natural habitats have been little studied. In this experiment, an arable field margin was sprayed with three rates of glyphosate (90 g active ingredient/hectare (a.i/ha), 180 g a.i./ha & 360 g a.i./ha) and control plots left unsprayed. Spiders were sampled monthly (June-October) using a converted garden-vac and adult spiders were identified to species. A total of 23,393 spiders was sampled with the web-spinners representing more than 90% of the individuals. The effects of glyphosate application on the abundance of wandering and web-spinning prey-capture guilds, and the two most abundant species (Gonatium rubens and Lepthyphantes tenuis) were analyzed using ANOVA F tests. The highest rate of glyphosate consistently reduced the total number of spiders, the numbers of web-spinners, G. rubens and L. tenuis, but not numbers of wandering spiders. Changes in vegetation structure and microclimate caused by the glyphosate are implicated in the reduction of numbers of spiders in plots receiving the highest rate of glyphosate. We conclude that glyphosate drift at rates of more than 360 g a.i./ha (active ingredients per hectare) into arable field margins could result in significant losses of important arthropod predators in farmland and a reduction in spider biodiversity in agroecosystems.

AB  - The problem of nitrogen pollution in European surface- and groundwaters has become a focus of recent European and Scandinavian directives, with legislation calling for a 50% reduction of N losses by the years 1995 and 2000, respectively. This paper provides a conceptual framework upon which management strategies to reduce losses of diffuse nitrogen pollution to surface waters may be based. The control of nitrogen pollution may take place through an increase in the complexity of the landscape, not throughout the catchment area, but rather in specific zones, the river corridor in particular. Within river corridors, riparian areas have been recognized globally for their value as nutrient removal "buffer systems". Studies have identified vegetation uptake and microbial denitrification as the primary mechanisms responsible for N removal in these systems. For these processes to function optimally on an annual basis, both vegetation and water regime must be managed. The establishment and management of riparian buffer zones in suitable places within river corridors, will provide a stable and sustainable water-protection function. This will complement future nitrogen input control strategies, needed for both the long-term protection of groundwater and surface waters in Europe as a whole, and for the proposed 50% reduction in nitrogen loading to the Baltic and North Sea coastal waters by the turn of the century.

AB  - Spatial variability in hydrological flowpaths and nitrate-removal processes complicates the overall assessment of riparian buffer zone functioning in terms of water quality improvement as well as enhancement of the greenhouse effect by N&#x2082;O emissions. In this study, we evaluated denitrification and nitrous oxide emission in winter and summer along two groundwater flowpaths in nitrate-loaded forested riparian buffer zone and related the variability in these processes to controlling soil factors. Denitrification and emissions of N&#x2082;O were measured using flux chambers and incubation experiments. In winter, N&#x2082;O emissions were significantly higher (12.4 mg N m&#x207b;&#xb2; d&#x207b;&#xb9;) along the flowpath with high nitrate removal compared with the flowpath with high nitrate removal compared with the flowpath with low nitrate removal (2.58 mg N m&#x207b;&#xb2; d&#x207b;&#xb9;). In summer a reverse pattern was observed, with higher N&#x2082;O emissions (13.6 mg N m&#x207b;&#xb2; d&#x207b;&#xb9;) from the flowpath with low nitrate-removal efficiencies. Distinct spatial patterns of denitrification and N&#x2082;O emission were observed along the high nitrate-removal transect compared to no clear pattern along the low nitrate-removal transect, where denitrification activity was very low. Results from this study indicate that spots with high nitrate-removal efficiency also contribute significantly to an increased N&#x2082;O emission from riparian zones. Furthermore, we conclude that high variability in N&#x2082;O:N&#x2082; ratio and weak relationships with environmental conditions limit the value of this ratio as a proxy to evaluate the environmental consequences of riparian buffer zones.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under its Continuous Enrollment Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has actively promoted establishment of conservation buffers. Although these programs are intended to benefit wildlife in addition to protecting soil and water resources, benefits to grassland birds may be compromised by narrow widths, presence of woody vegetation, and high predation pressure. During 2001 and 2002, we surveyed breeding grassland birds and searched for nests in 33 CRP filter strips that varied in planting mixture (cool-season vs. warm-season grasses) and adjacent edge type (non-wooded vs. wooded). The most abundant species in filter strips were red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), dickcissel (Spiza americana), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas). Relative abundances of birds and nests were similar between cool-season and warm-season planting mixtures. Dickcissels and red-winged blackbirds and their nests were relatively less abundant at wooded than non-wooded sites. Our nest success estimates generally were low in all treatments, and nest success varied little with the variables we studied. Predation was the major cause of nest failure; 62% of all nests were depredated. Although the most common birds using filter strips are generalists, filter strips also have potential to provide breeding habitat for some species of management concern.

AB  - Studies on the effectiveness of forest buffer strips left along streams after logging have long overlooked the biota of the buffers themselves, despite their high species richness. We investigated mosses and liverworts (bryophytes), abundant and species-rich groups in boreal forests, before and 2.5 years after logging along 15 small streams. In each site, two 1000-m2 (20 x 50 m) plots along the stream were inventoried; one plot in an area subjected to clear-cutting, and another in a buffer strip (10 m wide on each side of the stream). Ten plots along small streams in forest reserves in the same region were used as references. We found that less than half as many bryophyte species per plot disappeared after logging in the buffer strips compared to the clearcuts. The changes in bryophyte cover and in species composition were smaller in the buffer strips, and the species that were negatively affected in the clearcuts were less affected in the buffer strips. However, there was a significant change in species composition in the buffer strips compared to the references. Substrate form and taxonomic group were important factors in understanding this turnover. Many species growing on substrates with a convex form (e.g., logs, tree bases, and mesic ground) decreased or disappeared, while species on concave substrates were rather unaffected. This held for both mosses and liverworts, although liverworts were generally more sensitive than mosses. The difference in response of assemblages on convex vs. concave substrates makes changes in microclimate due to logging a likely explanation. The species in most need of protection (i.e., the red-listed species) were among the ones with strongest declines in the 20 m wide buffer strips. In order to function optimally for bryophyte conservation, forests along small streams need to be protected from high wind-throw frequency and strong edge effects. Increasing the width of buffer strips at sites with known or potential values (e.g., large amounts of woody debris or boulders) should be considered a better strategy than using narrow buffer strips with a fixed width.

AB  - Buffer strips have recently become the main management practice for reducing logging impact on stream habitats in boreal and temperate regions. The habitat value of buffer strips, however, has not received much attention, although riparian forests belong to the systems with the highest biodiversity in these regions. We used plants as indicators of the ability of buffer strips to maintain an environment similar to intact riparian forests in a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. We measured the growth of three common bryophyte species (Hylocomiastrum umbratum, Calypogeia integristipula, and Tritomaria quinquedentata} transplanted to riparian habitat close to a stream in clear-cut logged sites, 10-15 m wide buffer strips on each side of the stream, and intact (reference) sites. Each of the three site categories included six wet and six moist-mesic sites and the experiment was followed over three months in 1999. The species remained vital in the reference sites and grew substantially during the 3-mo-long experiment, but in the logged sites almost no growth was registered, and many shoots died (except for T. quinquedentata). The pattern was consistent irrespective of the ground moisture class. The performance of bryophytes in the moist-mesic buffer strips was almost as bad as in the logged sites, whereas in the wet buffer strips it was either intermediate between that in logged and reference sites (H. umbratum) or very similar to that in reference sites (C. integristipula and T. quinquedentata). The edge effect has previously been shown to vary depending on edge orientation, edge physiognomy, and weather conditions. We found that ground moisture can be of major importance as well. Although many buffer strips function better than no strips, 20-30 m wide strips (with a stream in the middle) through a logged area consist entirely of edge habitat. Increasing the buffer width and avoiding clear-cut logging on both sides of a watercourse would be the first steps to take for improving biodiversity conservation in riparian habitats. Our results also show that bryophytes are good indicators of habitat quality and efficient tools for assessing the ecological function of buffer strips.

AB  - We investigated the short-term effects of forest clearcutting on land snails (terrestrial gastropods) in 15 forest stands along small streams in Sweden. Two different silvicultural treatments were applied at each site: clearcutting across the stream channel and buffer strips 10 m wide on each side of the stream. Additionally, we studied 10 reference sites in unlogged riparian forests along similar-sized streams. All sites were studied before logging and then 2.5 years after logging. After clearcutting the number of individuals in a $0.5 m^2$ sample from each site decreased on average from 107 to 87, and the mean number of species per sample decreased from 9.9 to 7.7. Most species were negatively affected, but there were also clear differences in sensitivity. There were correlations between species survival and ground moisture. At the wettest clearcut sites with an almost intact bryophyte cover, the land snails were unaffected by clearcutting. This result suggests that wet or moist forest floors can serve as refugia even at very small spatial scales (e.g., shallow hollows, crevices). If this is an important mechanism, the spatial distribution of small habitats could be important for the long-term survival of the snail fauna or other small, dispersal-limited organisms at clearcut sites. In the buffer strips, the number of individuals decreased but not the number of species, indicating that buffer-strip retention is a good practice for protecting land snails in riparian forests. The varying effectiveness of the buffer strip could partly be explained by the proportion of the remaining basal area, emphasizing that buffer strips could be even more effective if efforts are made to avoid heavy damage by windthrows.

AB  - Alternative futures analysis can inform community decisions regarding land and water use. We conducted an alternative futures analysis in the Willamette River Basin in western Oregon. Based on detailed input from local stakeholders, three alternative future landscapes for the year 2050 were created and compared to present-day (circa 1990) and historical (pre-EuroAmerican settlement) landscapes. We evaluated the likely effects of these landscape changes on four endpoints: water availability, Willamette River, stream condition, and terrestrial wildlife. All three futures assume a doubling of the 1990 human population by 2050. The Plan Trend 2050 scenario assumes current policies and trends continue. Because Oregon has several conservation-oriented policies in place, landscape changes and projected environmental effects associated with this scenario were surprisingly small (most &#x2264;10% change relative to 1990). The scenario did, however, engender a debate among stakeholders about the reasonableness of assuming that existing policies would be implemented exactly as written if no further policy actions were taken. The Development 2050 scenario reflects a loosening of current policies, more market-oriented approach, as proposed by some stakeholders. Estimated effects of this scenario include loss of 24% of prime farmland; 39% more wildlife species would lose habitat than gain habitat relative to the 1990 landscape. Projected effects on aquatic biota were less severe, primarily because many of the land use changes involved conversion of agricultural lands into urban or rural development, both of which adversely impact streams. Finally, Conservation 2050 assumes that ecosystem protection and restoration are given higher priority, although still within the bounds of what stakeholders considered plausible. In response, most ecological indicators (both terrestrial and aquatic) recovered 20-70% of the losses sustained since EuroAmerican settlement. The one exception is water availability. Water consumed for out-of-stream uses increased under all three future scenarios (by 40-60%), with accompanying decreases in stream flow. Although the conservation measures incorporated into Conservation 2050 moderated the increase in consumption, they were not sufficient to reverse the trend. Results from these analyses have been actively discussed by stakeholder groups charged with developing a vision for the basin's future and a basin-wide restoration strategy.

AB  - Sustainable management of rangeland ecosystems has direct implications for conservation of biological diversity and for the livelihoods of local communities in the Himalayan region in general and the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ) in particular. This study aims to analyze the status of rangeland management in the SNPBZ from an ecological perspective. We used multivariate and bivariate analysis and geographic information system techniques to analyze ecological data and land use trends. A significant annual change with a 3.38% decrease in glacier area was observed between 1978 and 1996. We observed 168 plant species in the SNPBZ with a range of 3&#x2013;17 species per sample plot, where about 67% of plants were found to be palatable for livestock. Our study shows that total available fodder biomass on rangeland in the SNPBZ has not been fully utilized yet, because the total available supply exceeds the present demand under some assumptions: reduction of biomass through grazing causes higher productivity, resulting in a higher number of species, according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The results of this study could help improve decision-making related to sustainable rangeland management.

AB  - 1. Riparian trees regulate aquatic ecosystem processes, such as inputs of light, organic matter and nutrients, that can be altered dramatically when these trees are harvested. Riparian buffers (uncut strips of vegetation) are widely used to mitigate the impact of clear-cut logging on aquatic ecosystems but there have been few experimental assessments of their effectiveness. 2. Forests along 13 headwater stream reaches in south-western British Columbia, Canada, were clear-cut in 1998, creating three riparian buffer treatments (30-m buffer, 10-m buffer and clear-cut to the stream edge), or left as uncut controls, each treatment having three or four replicates. 3. We predicted that periphyton biomass and insect consumers would increase as buffer width decreased, because of increased solar flux. We used two complementary studies to test this prediction. 4. In one study, we compared benthic communities before and after logging in all 13 streams; a second study focused on periphyton and insect colonization dynamics over 6-week periods in each of four seasons in four streams, one in each treatment. 5. Photosynthetically active radiation, and mean and maximum water temperature, increased as buffer width narrowed. 6. Periphyton biomass, periphyton inorganic mass and Chironomidae abundance also increased as buffer width narrowed, with the largest differences occurring in the clear-cut and 10-m buffer treatments. 7. Photosynthetically active radiation, water temperature, periphyton biomass and periphyton inorganic mass were significantly greater in the 30-m buffer treatment than in controls during some seasons. 8. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that a gradient of riparian buffer widths created a gradient in light and temperature that led to non-linear increases in periphyton biomass and insect abundance. For example, Chironomidae abundance was generally greater in the 10-m and 30-m buffer treatments than in controls, whereas this was not always the case in the clear-cut treatment. This pattern may be due to the high sediment content of the periphyton mat in the clear-cut treatment, which potentially limited the response of some insects to increased food resources. Overall, our results indicate that uncut riparian buffers of 30-m or more on both sides of the stream were needed to limit biotic and abiotic changes associated with clear-cut logging in headwater, forested watersheds.

AB  - AbstractPrevious studies on the effects of logging on streams have suggested that light and water temperature were important variables structuring stream communities but, in many cases, these effects were confounded. We observed pronounced gradients in the flux of solar energy and water temperature in an earlier large-scale experiment in which we manipulated the width of riparian buffers along headwater streams. Associated with these abiotic changes were increases in periphyton biomass and primary consumer abundance. We present results from a study in streamside channels that was designed to isolate the effects of light on stream communities, while holding water temperature constant. Light treatments in the channel experiment simulated inputs of solar radiation created during the prior watershed-scale experiment. Results from the present study suggested that consumers limited periphyton biomass early in the study; however, a rainstorm midway through the experiment reduced periphyton biomass and insect consumer abundance. Following this disturbance, chlorophyll a biomass was 2 to 4 times higher in the full sunlight treatment compared to the 2 lowest light treatments. At the end of the study, primary consumer abundance, biomass, survival, and growth rate were positively related to light and periphyton resources. Therefore, we inferred biotic control of periphyton during the early part of the channel study, whereas light appeared to control periphyton at the end of the study. Results from the large-scale and channel experiments suggested that light was the primary constraint on periphyton biomass accrual. Moreover, both experiments, especially the channel study, showed that light indirectly influenced consumer performance as mediated by increased primary production.

AB  - Forested buffer strips are used to mitigate fragmentation and habitat loss and are a common feature in management of riparian landscapes. Low-elevation, old-growth coastal forests are a rare riparian habitat that can benefit from similar conservation measures. We evaluated the effectiveness of postlogging, forested buffer strips for forest-dwelling birds in the coastal temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska, USA. Our objective was to compare bird composition and density among forested buffer strips of differing widths and controls at the stand and landscape scales. We applied a 2-stage sampling design stratified by forested buffer width and randomly selected 24 managed and 18 control sites to sample over 2 breeding seasons. We estimated abundance of birds using the paired-observer, variable-circular plot method. We modeled combined effects of buffer width and vegetation and landscape characteristics on bird density at 2 spatial scales. Species richness and diversity were greatest in the narrowest buffers, but species composition in the largest buffers (&#x2265;400 m) was most similar to that in control blocks. Abundance of 3 of 10 common species differed across forested buffer treatments and controls. Densities of red-breasted sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) and Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) were positively related to buffer width, whereas density of ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) was negatively associated with buffer width. Parameter estimates for buffer width effects at both spatial scales were similar within species. We found few habitat and landscape variables that clearly affected density of our focal species, and among species no predictor variables affected density in a similar fashion. We recommend retaining forested buffers &#x2265;400 m to support composition and abundance of forest-dwelling birds, particularly those species that rely on interior forest conditions.

AB  - Forested riparian and wetland buffers can help protect stream water quality, provide wildlife habitat, preserve floodplains and wetlands, protect against erosion, and provide recreational value. Many waterways have no buffers or buffers that have been degraded by human activities, including agriculture and urban development. To plan, evaluate, and restore riparian buffers, wetland managers need to monitor the conditions of constantly changing buffers over time. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective monitoring approach. Because riparian and wetland buffer zones exhibit extreme variations in width, length, spatial complexity, soil, and vegetation cover, mapping their hydrology and land cover requires high-spatial-and high-spectral-resolution data. The recent availability of high-spatial-resolution satellite and high-spectral-resolution aircraft imagery has significantly improved the capacity for mapping riparian buffers, wetlands, and other ecosystems. However, satellite sensors still do not have the combined spatial and spectral resolution to reliably identify buffer vegetation types and conditions. New interpretation strategies need to be developed to maximize the information obtained from high-resolution satellite sensors while minimizing the problems specific to high-resolution imagery, such as high variability within scene elements and within scene objects. The objective of this article is to review applications of remotely sensed data for modeling, designing, and evaluating riparian and wetland buffers.

AB  - Although the effectiveness of vegetative filter strips (VFS) for reducing herbicide runoff is well documented, a comprehensive review of the literature does not exist. The objective of this article are to denote the methods developed for evaluating herbicide retention in VFS; ascertain the efficacy of VFS regarding abating herbicide runoff; identify parameters that affect herbicide retention in VFS; review the environmental fate of herbicides retained by VFS; and identify future research needs. The retention of herbicide runoff by VFS has been evaluated in nutural rainfall, simulated rainfall, and simulated run-on experiments. Parameters affecting herbicide retention in VFS include width VFS, area ratio, species established in the VFS, time after establishment of the VFS, antecedent moisture content, nominal herbicide inflow concentration, and herbicide properties. Generally, subsequent transport of herbicides retained by VFS is reduced relative to adjacent cultivated soil because of enhanced sorption and degradation in the former.

AB  - This study investigates how proximity to cropland influences residential property values and considers the public policy implications. The hedonic model generalizes previous studies by recognizing that the bundle of externalities generated by crop production may increase the price of some homes and decrease the price of others, depending on their respective locations. Using an instrumental variables approach to estimate the model for San Joaquin County, California, suggests that proximity to cropland increases the value of most, but not all, single-family homes near the agricultural-urban edge. The results imply an agricultural buffer zone of 68 meters would mitigate most cropland disamenities.

AB  - In managed forests, riparian buffer strips typically are maintained to protect water quality. If properly designed, buffer strips also may act as wildlife reserves. However, forest managers have lacked the information to develop standards for buffer strips to maximize benefits for wildlife species. We assessed the conservation potential of 20-, 100-, and 200-m wide buffers for an area-sensitive songbird in boreal mixed-wood forest in Alberta. We measured abundance, territory characteristics, and pairing success of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) at treatment and control lakes one year before and after upland timber harvest. After harvest, Ovenbirds were absent from 20-m buffer strips. Harvesting did not significantly influence abundance or territory size in 100-m or 200-m buffers, although territories generally became narrower. Postharvest territory position did not change in 200-m buffers, but territories in 100-m strips shifted lakeward and included more habitat adjacent to the riparian edge than before harvest. Despite this shift in territory position, males that occupied 100-m strips successfully attracted mates. High availability of regional forest cover may have muted the more pronounced effects of habitat alteration observed in other studies. Our research is among the first to evaluate individual behavioral responses to the creation of forest edges. Our data indicate that 20-m buffer strips do not support breeding Ovenbirds, whereas 100- and 200-m buffers retain Ovenbirds during the year following harvest. Longterm harvest effects may differ from those we monitored and require study, particularly as timber extraction increases in the boreal mixed-wood ecoregion.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to gain information on the temporal occurrence, spatial range and dispersion of maize pollen, and thus potentially Bt maize pollen densities in field margins in Bavaria, South Germany. This information is an important part of the risk assessment of Bt maize as it characterises the potential environmental exposure of non-target organisms to Bt pollen. The majority (91 %) of maize fields shed pollen in July, but the beginning of anthesis could be recorded as early as June 27 and as late as August 8. The Bt176 event 'Navares' shed pollen about 1 week earlier than the average anthesis date of other maize cultivars. Pollen numbers deposited in field margins were highly variable, and decreased with distance to field edge. The main factors determining pollen densities were relative humidity, growth stage of the maize, and distance to field edge explaining together 48 % of the variance of pollen amounts. The more pollen were deposited in maize field margin, the more pollen was found on leaves of wild carrots located at maize field edge. Cry1Ab amounts in pollen of the events Bt176 and Mon810 were found to be roughly in the range reported so far. The results provide helpful and effective information with regard to the evaluation of the exposure of butterflies to Bt maize pollen. Zur &#xf6;kologischen Risikoabsch&#xe4;tzung von Bt-Mais ist es notwendig, Informationen &#xfc;ber das zeitliche Auftreten von Maispollen sowie Menge und Reichweite des Polleneintrages in Feldr&#xe4;nder zu ber&#xfc;cksichtigen, da diese Faktoren die Exposition betroffener Nichtziel-Organismen mitbestimmen. Der Gro&#xdf;teil der untersuchten Maisfelder (91 %) bl&#xfc;hte im Juli, der Beginn der Pollensch&#xfc;ttung konnte aber auch fr&#xfc;hestens Ende Juni oder sp&#xe4;testens Anfang August liegen. Der Bl&#xfc;hbeginn der Bt176-Sorte 'Navares' lag circa 1 Woche fr&#xfc;her als der Durchschnittswert der anderen Maissorten. Die Maispollendichte in Feldr&#xe4;ndern war sehr variabel und nahm mit steigender Entfernung zum Maisfeld ab. Relative Feuchte, Bl&#xfc;hstadium des Mais' und Entfernung zum Maisfeld waren die Faktoren, welche die Pollendichte am st&#xe4;rksten beeinflussten (R&#xb2; = 48 %). Je mehr Maispollen im Maisfeldrand eingetragen wurden desto mehr Pollen fanden sich auch auf Bl&#xe4;ttern von Wilder M&#xf6;hre. Die Konzentration an nachgewiesenem Cry1Ab-Toxin in Bt176-und Mon810-Mais lag im Wesentlichen im bekannten Bereich. Die Ergebnisse tragen zu einer verbesserten Einsch&#xe4;tzung der Exposition durch Bt-Maispollen von Schmetterlingslarven am Feldrand bei.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) potentially reduce herbicide transport from agricultural fields by increasing herbicide mass infiltrated $(M_{{\rm inf}})$ and herbicide mass adsorbed $(M_{{\rm as}})$ compared with bare field soil. However, there are conflicting reports in the literature concerning the contribution of ${\rm M}_{{\rm as}}$ to herbicide trapping efficiency (TE). Moreover, no study has evaluated TE among metolachlor and metolachlor metabolites in a VFS. This experiment was conducted to compare TE, $M_{{\rm inf}}$, and $M_{{\rm as}}$ among metolachlor, metolachlor oxanilic acid (OA), and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (ESA) in buffalograss filter strips. Runoff was applied as a point source upslope of a 1- &#xd7; 3-m microwatershed at a rate of 750 L h&#x207b;&#xb9;. The point source was fortified with metolachlor, metolachlor OA, and metolachlor ESA, each at 0.12 &#x3bc;g ml&#x207b;&#xb9;. After moving through the plot, water samples were collected at 5-min intervals and stored at 5 C until analysis. Water samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection. TE was significantly greater for metolachlor (25.3%) as compared with the OA (15.5%) and ESA metabolites (14.2%). The average $M_{{\rm inf}}$ was 8.5% and was not significantly different among compounds. Significantly more metolachlor (17.3%) was retained as ${\rm M}_{{\rm as}}$ compared with either metolachlor OA (7.0%) or metolachlor ESA (5.5%). Moreover, $M_{{\rm as}}$ accounted for 68 and 42% of the total TE for metolachlor and metolachlor metabolites, respectively. These results demonstrate that adsorption to the VFS grass, grass thatch, or soil surface (or all) is an important retention mechanism for metolachlor and metolachlor metabolites, especially under saturated conditions. Moreover, the ${\rm M}_{{\rm as}}$ data indicate that metolachlor is preferentially retained by the VFS grass, grass thatch, or soil surface (or all) compared with the OA and ESA metabolites. Greater metolachlor retention in VFS compared with the OA and ESA metabolites may partially explain why metolachlor metabolites are frequently measured at higher concentrations than metolachlor is in surface water.

AB  - AbstractFire and grazers (such as Bison bison) were historically among the most important agents for maintaining and managing tallgrass prairie, but we know little about their influences on water-quality dynamics in streams. We analyzed 2&#xa0;y of data on total suspended solids (TSS), total N (TN), and total P (TP) (3 samples per week per stream during flow) in 3 prairie streams with fire and bison grazing treatments at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas (USA), to assess whether fire and bison increase the concentrations of these water-quality variables. We quantified the spatial and temporal locations of bison (&#x223c;0.21 animal units/ha) with Global Positioning System collars and documented bison trails, paw patches, wallows, and naturally exposed sediment patches within riparian buffers. Three weeks post-fire, TN and TP decreased (t-test, p < 0.001), but TSS did not change. Bison spent <6% of their time within 10&#xa0;m of the streams, increased the amount of exposed sediment in the riparian areas, and avoided wooded mainstem branches of stream (&#x3c7;2 test, p < 0.001). Temporal trends suggest that low discharge or increased bison density in the stream may increase TSS and TP during the summer months. Our results indicate a weak connection between TSS and nutrients with bison access to streams over our 2-y study and indicate that low TSS and nutrients characterize tallgrass prairie streams with fire and moderate bison densities relative to surrounding land uses.

AB  - This study analyzed a variety of satellite imagery, aerial photography, digital land-use/land-cover data, and historical maps to document existing conditions, as well as assess long-term trends of habitat loss and alteration in Barnegat Bay and its watershed. As part of the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP), land cover was mapped at three different time periods: 1972, 1984, and 1995. Based on the CCAP data, a set of landscape-level environmental indicators was developed to provide quantitative estimates of estuarine resource condition: watershed land cover, riparian corridors, shoreline buffer, and tidal salt marsh. By all of these measures, Barnegat Bay has been significantly impacted by human land-use activities. The amount of human development in the Barnegat Bay watershed has increased from 18% to 28% between 1972 and 1995. The region's riparian corridors are similarly impacted, with approximately 20% of the adjacent buffer areas (out to 90 m) developed or otherwise altered. Development intensifies closer to the bay shoreline, with approximately 36% of the total length bulkheaded and over 70% of the adjacent upland shoreline buffer developed. Barnegat Bay lost more than 25% of its salt marshes during the past century due to infilling and development. Through government legislation and regulation, some of the most destructive past practices, such as dredging and filling of coastal salt and freshwater marshes and large-scale development of the headwater portions of the bay's watershed, have been largely eliminated.

AB  - We quantified breeding bird abundance, diversity, and indicator species in riparian and upland dry forests along 6 third- to fourth-order streams on the east slope of the Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Upland dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages, diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species accounted for 75% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests. Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects between riparian and upland zones.

AB  - Nutrient retention mechanisms in riparian buffer strips are reviewed with emphasis on surface runoff and subsurface flows, the main pathways of exchanges between the stream and its surroundings. Unique physical and biogeochemical properties prevailing in these riparian ecotones dictate the flux of water, nutrients and other exogenous substances between the upland areas and the stream. Removal of nutrients from surface inflows is induced by deposition of sediment bound nutrients and exchange of dissolved nutrients with the soil/litter surface. Removal of nitrogen in subsurface flows can partly be explained by vegetation uptake, but the main mechanism for removal is usually denitrification. In channelized streams, the subsurface inflows have, in most cases, been altered to discharges via drainage tiles, with the exchange flows (water leaving and re-entering the open-channel via the stream bed and banks) being greatly decreased. Consequently, to improve nitrogen removal in these systems, these flows have to be intercepted or re-established either through restoration of the old stream valley or through managed structures in the buffer strips.

AB  - This paper examines the potential to reverse bed degradation trends in the Dr&#xf4;me River (southeast France), a prealpine gravel-bed stream, by assessing coarse sediment supply in tributary subbasins. Two approaches are developed. First, a Principal Component Analysis was performed on 24 subwatersheds to characterize the most productive ones. Second, fieldwork and aerial photographs provide detailed assessment for two mountain streams, one characterized by abundant bed-load (the Esconavette Creek), the other characterized by 30 yr of inactivity (the Barnavette Creek). Active tributaries (with developed active gravel bars) have been discriminated according to variables describing watershed sediment storage and production potential. Variables describing human intervention on erosion and vegetation cover appear to exert secondary influences on geomorphic activity in a context of general geomorphic stabilization. Declining activity associates features such as bed incision, channel narrowing, and vegetation development in riparian buffer strips in the two mountain streams studied. They are more frequent on the Barnavette Creek, the inactivity of which is partly explained by smaller lateral inputs from valley-filling.

AB  - Riparian forest buffers may play a critical role in moderating the impacts of deforestation on tropical stream ecosystems, but very few studies have examined the ecological effects of riparian buffers in the tropics. To test the hypothesis that riparian forest buffers can reduce the impacts of deforestation on tropical stream biota, we sampled fish assemblages in lowland headwater streams in southeastern Costa Rica representing three different treatments: (1) forested reference stream reaches, (2) stream reaches adjacent to pasture with a riparian forest buffer averaging at least 15 m in width on each bank, and (3) stream reaches adjacent to pasture without a riparian forest buffer. Land cover upstream from the study reaches was dominated by forest at all of the sites, allowing us to isolate the reach-scale effects of the three study treatments. Fish density was significantly higher in pasture reaches than in forest and forest buffer reaches, mostly due to an increase in herbivore-detritivores, but fish biomass did not differ among reach types. Fish species richness was also higher in pasture reaches than in forested reference reaches, while forest buffer reaches were intermediate. Overall, the taxonomic and trophic structure of fish assemblages in forest and forest buffer reaches was very similar, while assemblages in pasture reaches were quite distinct. These patterns were persistent across three sampling periods during our 15-month study. Differences in stream ecosystem conditions between pasture reaches and forested sites, including higher stream temperatures, reduced fruit and seed inputs, and a trend toward increased periphyton abundance, appeared to favor fish species normally found in larger streams and facilitate a native invasion process. Forest buffer reaches, in contrast, had stream temperatures and allochthonous inputs more similar to forested streams. Our results illustrate the importance of riparian areas to stream ecosystem integrity in the tropics and provide support for Costa Rican legislation protecting riparian forests.

AB  - The importance of managing weeds in seminatural habitats that are adjacent to farm fields is unclear. Weedy-margin vegetation may harbor pests or pathogens and may also serve as source populations for ongoing immigration of weeds into the field. It is also possible, however, that margin vegetation provides habitat for organisms that consume weed seeds or suppress the likelihood of pest or pathogen outbreak. We examined the nature of margin habitat using spatial-scaling of weed-species richness as an ecological assay. In 2003, we recorded the occurrence of weedy species along the perimeters of 63 fields in Wisconsin. The fields were distributed within six counties that differed in topography, geological history, local climate, and soil type and which spanned the range of variability in the agricultural landscape. We identified seven habitats that differed in geology and land use. The relationship between species richness and margin class was estimated using an analog of the power law. Additionally, we investigated broadscale correlates of habitat heterogeneity at the field level, using a modeling strategy that included additional explanatory factors logically connected to plant diversity. Using a model-confrontation approach, the survey supported the inclusion of two topographical diversity indices, elevation gradient and a field-shape index, into our model. Our broadscale survey provides information on one of a suite of important considerations needed to make decisions about the importance of managing weeds in field margins.

AB  - Question: How does agricultural land usage affect plant species diversity in semi-natural buffer strips at multiple scales? Location: Leps&#xe4;m&#xe4; River watershed, Nurmij&#xe4;rvi, Southern Finland. Methods: Species diversity indicators included both richness and evenness. Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324 ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses. Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coefficients for species richness at the second largest scale (196 ha). The density of arable field edges between the fields was the only metric that correlated with species evenness for all scales, which had highest predictive power at the second smallest scale (36 ha). Conclusions: Species richness and evenness of buffer strips had scale-dependent relationships to land use in agricultural ecosystems. The results of this study indicated that species richness depends on the pattern of arable land use at large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool. Meanwhile, species evenness depended on the level of field edge density at small scales, which relates to how the nearby farmland was divided by the edges (e.g. many small-scale fields with high edge density or a few big-scale fields with low edge density). This implies that it is important to manage the biodiversity of buffer strips within a landscape context at multiple scales.

AB  - We conducted a 3-year field experiment to measure the frequency of bird movements through riparian buffer strips before and after harvesting of adjacent forest. Our study was conducted in the boreal mixed wood forest of Alberta and was designed to determine empirically whether songbirds use riparian buffer strips of forest connecting forest reserves as corridors and if they move along these buffer strips more frequently than they cross adjacent clearcuts. We used mist nets to obtain an index of the frequency of bird movement in the forest, and we observed bird movements across adjacent clearcuts for comparison. We predicted that the frequency of movement would be greater (1) in buffer strips after harvesting of adjacent forest than before harvesting, (2) in buffer strips than across clearcuts and, (3) in buffer strips than at control sites (lakeshore forest with no adjacent clearcuts). After adjusting for year-to-year variation in abundance, we found that capture rates increased significantly from pre- to post-harvest, but only for juveniles. Capture rates of adults decreased immediately after harvesting, probably because of the removal of an adjacent source of birds that previously moved through the lakeside forest. Movement rates of forest species in clearcuts were significantly lower than capture rates in the forest. The number of adults captured was positively correlated with the number of territories in the buffer strips, indicating that most birds captured were probably residents. The number of local territories was a poor predictor of juvenile captures, supporting the notion that juveniles were likely dispersing individuals. Our results indicate that buffer strips enhanced movements of juveniles (i.e., acted as corridors) and maintained movement rates of adults. Furthermore, there appeared to be a threshold distance between reserves below which birds may be less reluctant to fly across openings, making corridor use less important.

AB  - Studies of forested rural watersheds provide estimates of background contamination for comparison with streams and rivers in other settings. We performed a landscape analysis and measured major dissolved ions and benthic macroinvertebrates for a small rural watershed in Albany County, NY, to determine spatial variation in water quality. An estimated 73% of the surface cover is post-agricultural forest, with only 2.3% of the watershed covered by roads and other impervious surfaces. Although water quality was consistently high in most of the creek, we detected three relatively distinct zones separated by impoundments; zonation was most apparent in relative concentrations of major ions, less so with benthic macroinvertebrate community similarity. At ten sample stations, buffer size, measured as upstream land cover and distance to nearest road, did not correlate well with chemical water quality indicators. In particular, we found the highest levels of chloride, indicative of road-salt contamination, in areas of maximum forest buffer. Small feeder creeks that drain nearby roads may function as "leaks" in otherwise well-buffered watersheds with low road densities.

AB  - Historically, forested riparian buffers have been created to provide protection for aquatic organisms and aquatic ecosystem functions. Increasingly, new and existing riparian buffers are being used also to meet terrestrial conservation requirements. To test the effectiveness of riparian buffers for conserving terrestrial fauna, we conducted a meta-analysis using published data from 397 comparisons of species abundance in riparian buffers and unharvested (reference) riparian sites. The response of terrestrial species to riparian buffers was not consistent between taxonomic groups; bird and arthropod abundances were significantly greater in buffers relative to unharvested areas, whereas amphibian abundance decreased. Edge-preferring species were more abundant in buffer sites than reference sites, whereas species associated with interior habitat were not significantly different in abundance. The degree of buffer effect on animal abundance was unrelated to buffer width; wider buffers did not result in greater similarity between reference and buffer sites. However, responses to buffer treatment were more variable in buffers <50 m wide, a commonly prescribed width in many management plans. Our results indicate that current buffer prescriptions do not maintain most terrestrial organisms in buffer strips at levels comparable to undisturbed sites.

AB  - Riparian forest management plans for numerous regions throughout the world must consider long-term supply of wood to streams. The simulation model OSU STREAM-WOOD was used to evaluate the potential effects of riparian management scenarios on the standing stock of wood in a hypothetical stream in the Pacific Northwest, USA. OSU STREAMWOOD simulates riparian forest growth, tree entry (including breakage), and inchannel processes (log breakage, movement, and decomposition). Results of three simulation scenarios are reported. The first scenario assessed total wood volume in the channel from Douglas-fir plantations clearcut to the stream bank using three rotation periods (60, 90, and 120 yr). Without a forested riparian management zone, accumulation of wood in the channel was minimal and did not increase through time. In the second scenario, response of total wood volume to forested riparian management zones of widths between 6 m and 75 m was evaluated. Total wood volume associated with the 6 m wide nonharvested forest for forest ages &#x2265;240 yr was 32% of the standing stock associated with a nonharvested forest buffer one potential tree height in width. Maximum standing stock associated with the channel for nonharvested riparian forests &#x2265;30 m required 500-yr-old forests. In the third scenario, contribution of wood from forest plantations beyond nonharvested forests of various widths was explored. Forest plantations associated with nonharvested riparian buffers with widths >10 m contributed minimal amounts of wood volume to the stream. These results suggest that forest age and width of the nonharvested buffers are more important than the rotation age of plantation forests in providing long-term supplies of wood to streams.

AB  - Alberta's boreal mixedwood forest has seen intensifying industrial activity in the past several decades, largely from logging and petroleum extraction. At the same time, populations of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) have been recovering from past near-extirpation. We conducted detailed field surveys of six beaver dam sites on low-order streams in northeastern Alberta and examined a 50-y chronosequence of air photos at each site to quantify beavers' effects on riparian forests. Beaver activity increased the width and diversity of riparian zones along first- and second-order streams. Over the 50-y time sequence, dam number increased considerably and beaver activity converted narrow, entirely lotie habitats to a mix of lentie and lotie. Current forestry operating ground rules in Alberta require 30- to 60-m unharvested buffer strips on permanent streams. Around dams, beaver felling removed most or all Populus trees within 30-40 m of the pond edge. The abundance of dams and their tendency to be built in chains altered vegetation structure over long stretches of riparian corridors. Beavers thus could be removing forest cover from entire buffer strips in direct conflict with forest management objectives. We argue that beavers may be the primary disturbance agent structuring riparian zones on low-order streams in the study area and that unharvested riparian buffer strips should be much wider than currently prescribed in order both to provide beaver habitat and to ensure appropriate protection of riparian habitats. Les activit&#xe9;s industrielles telles que la coupe foresti&#xe8;re et l'extraction de p&#xe9;trole se sont intensifi&#xe9;es ces derni&#xe8;res d&#xe9;cennies dans les for&#xea;ts mixtes de l'Alberta. Durant la m&#xea;me p&#xe9;riode, les populations de castor d'Am&#xe9;rique du Nord (Castor canadensis) presque &#xe9;teintes dans le pass&#xe9; &#xe9;taient en voie de r&#xe9;cup&#xe9;ration. Nous avons &#xe9;tudi&#xe9; en d&#xe9;tail six sites o&#xf9; l'on retrouvait des barrages de castor sur des ruisseaux d'ordre inf&#xe9;rieur dans le nord-est de l'Alberta. Pour chacun des sites, nous avons examin&#xe9; une chronosequence de photos a&#xe9;riennes sur 50 ans afin de d&#xe9;terminer les effets des castors sur les for&#xea;ts riveraines. Pour les ruisseaux de premier et de second ordre, l'activit&#xe9; du castor a caus&#xe9; une augmentation de la largeur et de la diversit&#xe9; des for&#xea;ts riveraines. Au cours de la s&#xe9;quence temporelle de 50 ans, le nombre de barrages a augment&#xe9; consid&#xe9;rablement et l'activit&#xe9; du castor a converti d'&#xe9;troits habitats compl&#xe8;tement l&#xe9;nitiques en un m&#xe9;lange d'habitats l&#xe9;nitiques et lotiques. Actuellement, en Alberta, les r&#xe8;gles de base des op&#xe9;rations foresti&#xe8;res requi&#xe8;rent de laisser une bande tampon intacte de 30-60 m le long de cours d'eau permanents. Pr&#xe8;s des barrages, la coupe d'arbres par le castor a presque compl&#xe8;tement fait dispara&#xee;tre les peupliers des 30-40 premiers m&#xe8;tres autour des &#xe9;tangs. L'abondance de barrages et la tendance qu'ils soient construits en cha&#xee;ne ont provoqu&#xe9; une alt&#xe9;ration de la structure de la v&#xe9;g&#xe9;tation sur de longues portions de corridors riverains. Les castors peuvent donc faire dispara&#xee;tre le couvert forestier de bandes tampons enti&#xe8;res entrant ainsi en conflit avec les objectifs d'am&#xe9;nagement forestier. Nous croyons que les castors repr&#xe9;sentent l'agent de perturbation principal structurant les zones riveraines des ruisseaux d'ordre inf&#xe9;rieur dans la zone d'&#xe9;tude. Nous sugg&#xe9;rons que les bandes tampons laiss&#xe9;es intactes soient beaucoup plus larges que ce qui est pr&#xe9;sentement requis afin de procurer un habitat aux castors tout en s'assurant d'une protection ad&#xe9;quate des habitats riverains.

AB  - Remnants of old forests left on the landscape following forest harvesting, especially corridors, provide benefits of connectivity and facilitation of movement or dispersal, which may be hindered by the presence of edges. Our objective was to determine the extent of edge influence on forest structure in these forest remnants in black spruce boreal forest. We sampled canopy cover and the density of trees, snags, and logs along clearcut edge-forest gradients in large forest patches, cutblock separators, and riparian buffers. The distance-of-edge influence was determined by comparing values at different distances from the edge to values in interior forest using randomization tests. Forest remnants had lower live tree density and canopy cover and higher mortality and windthrow than interior forest. Distance-of-edge influence on forest structure extended 10-30 m from the edge, and was slightly more extensive into cutblock separators where two edges are in close proximity, but was less extensive in riparian buffers, possibly due to the presence of stable internal edges near the stream. Because of edge influence, structure near the edges of forest remnants and across narrow corridors is modified; wider corridors would be required to provide a core habitat of interior forest conditions. Les parcelles r&#xe9;siduelles de vieilles for&#xea;ts laiss&#xe9;es &#xe0; la suite de coupes foresti&#xe8;res, particuli&#xe8;rement les corridors, procurent des b&#xe9;n&#xe9;fices au niveau de la connectivit&#xe9; en facilitant les mouvements ou la dispersion, ces b&#xe9;n&#xe9;fices peuvent &#xea;tre entrav&#xe9;s par la pr&#xe9;sence de bordures. Notre objectif &#xe9;tait de d&#xe9;terminer l'&#xe9;tendue de l'influence des bordures sur la structure des for&#xea;ts r&#xe9;siduelles dans la pessi&#xe8;re noire bor&#xe9;ale. Nous avons &#xe9;chantillonn&#xe9; le couvert forestier et la densit&#xe9; des arbres, des chicots et des billes au sol le long d'un gradient de bordures entre des coupes &#xe0; blanc et des for&#xea;ts r&#xe9;siduelles pour de grandes parcelles r&#xe9;siduelles, des s&#xe9;parateurs de coupe et des bandes riveraines. L'&#xe9;tendue de l'effet de bordure a &#xe9;t&#xe9; d&#xe9;termin&#xe9;e en comparant les valeurs mesur&#xe9;es &#xe0; diff&#xe9;rentes distances de la bordure avec celles mesur&#xe9;es &#xe0; l'int&#xe9;rieur de la for&#xea;t en utilisant des tests de randomisation. Les for&#xea;ts r&#xe9;siduelles avaient une densit&#xe9; d'arbres vivants et un couvert inf&#xe9;rieurs, une plus grande mortalit&#xe9; et plus de chablis que les for&#xea;ts int&#xe9;rieures. L'effet de bordure sur la structure de la for&#xea;t s'&#xe9;tendait jusqu'&#xe0; 10-30 m de la bordure et &#xe9;tait l&#xe9;g&#xe8;rement plus important dans les s&#xe9;parateurs de coupes o&#xf9; les deux bordures sont proches l'une de l'autre mais &#xe9;tait moins important dans les bandes riveraines probablement en raison de la bordure interne stable pr&#xe8;s du ruisseau. &#xc0; cause de l'effet de bordure, la structure des for&#xea;ts r&#xe9;siduelles pr&#xe8;s des bordures et dans les corridors &#xe9;troits est modifi&#xe9;e. Ainsi des corridors plus larges seraient n&#xe9;cessaires pour procurer des habitats intacts de for&#xea;ts int&#xe9;rieures.

AB  - In a declining herd, surviving deer inhabited overlapping edges of wolf-pack territories. There, wolves hunted little until desperate, in order to avoid fatal encounters with neighbors. Such encounters reduce wolf numbers and predation pressure and apparently allow surviving deer along territory edges to repopulate the area through dispersal of their prime, less vulnerable offspring into territory cores.

Twenty-three percent of the wolves were killed precisely on the borders of their estimated territories; 41%, within 1.0 km (16% of the radius of their mean-estimated territory) inside or outside the estimated edge; 91%, within 3.2 km inside or outside (50% of the radius of their mean-estimated territory) of the estimated edge.

AB  - Retention of riparian buffers is a common management practice used to protect streams from the effects of upslope forest harvest. We compared bird use of riparian buffers along main stem rivers, tributary streams, and reference riparian zones having intact, upslope forests. Community composition differed considerably between buffers and references, and also between main stems and tributaries. Density of the more common species (those detected >20 times) was significantly higher along main stems than along tributaries. Four species (bay-breasted warbler, black-throated green warbler, blue jay, Cape May warbler) were more abundant along main stems than along tributaries; no species was more abundant along tributaries. The overall density of less common species was significantly higher in buffer strips than in reference sites, but four of the more common species (bay-breasted, blackburnian, black-throated green, and Cape May warblers) were more abundant in reference sites than in buffer strips. We did not detect differences in species diversity or richness among the different site types, but edge-species were significantly more common in buffer strips than in reference sites. Interior-species, in contrast, were significantly more common in reference sites.

AB  - Climate change is expected to drive species extinct by reducing their survival, reproduction and habitat. Less well appreciated is the possibility that climate change could cause extinction by changing the ecological interactions between species. If ecologists, land managers and policy makers are to manage farmland biodiversity sustainably under global climate change, they need to understand the ways in which species interact with each other as this will affect the way they respond to climate change. Here, we consider the ability of nectar flower mixtures used in field margins to provide sufficient forage for bumble-bees under future climate change. We simulated the effect of global warming on the network of plant&#x2014;pollinator interactions in two types of field margin: a four-species pollen and nectar mix and a six-species wildflower mix. While periods without flowering resources and periods with no food were rare, curtailment of the field season was very common for the bumble-bees in both mixtures. The effect of this, however, could be ameliorated by adding extra species at the start and end of the flowering season. The plant species that could be used to future-proof margins against global warming are discussed.

AB  - Recognition is growing that the successful management of protected areas ultimately depends on the cooperation and support of local people. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in financial support for projects attempting to link the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas with local social and economic development. Drawing on our recent analysis of 23 integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs) in 14 developing countries, this paper explores the challenges which have arisen in operationalizing two key concepts which lie at the heart of community-based conservation. First, buffer zones around park boundaries. Second, greater participation of local people in conservation and development. We describe important practical constraints which have so far limited the effective implementation of these two concepts. But-despite some critical constraints operating outside individual projects' sphere of influence-we conclude that innovative, well-designed projects at carefully selected protected area sites that constructively address local people-park relationships will be essential to the conservation of biodiversity, and thus to sustainable development.

AB  - An experiment compared 2 yr of mowing, mulching, spot treatment with glyphosate, or no maintenance for reed canarygrass control and measured their effect on the establishment of red alder and arroyo willow. At one site, pretransplant control of reed canarygrass was poor, and mulching or no maintenance gave 9 and 14% control, respectively, at 5 mo after planting (MAP), but glyphosate spot treatment and mowing resulted in 89% and 72% control, respectively. The highest leafiness percentage by 24 MAP for arroyo willow and red alder at that site occurred in spot-treated plots (59 and 6%, respectively). Tree protection resulted in 30% more arroyo willow saplings with leaves at 24 MAP, at an average height of 68 cm at 17 MAP. Over the 2-yr trial at that site, mowing required far more time (30.6 min/plot) than either mulching or spot spraying (18.6 and 13.5 min/plot, respectively). At a second site, pretransplant weed control was excellent and maintenance programs controlled reed canarygrass from 88 to 98% by 5 MAP. Tree leafiness of red alder was improved 20% at 24 MAP by tree protection, with protected trees being 107 cm tall compared with 64 cm when left bare. Over the 2-yr trial at that site, mulching required 14.8 min/plot, compared with 12.9 and 7.6 min/plot for mowing and spot treatment. Annual spot treatment of reed canarygrass regrowth with glyphosate may be the most cost-effective means of achieving successful reestablishment of native broadleaf trees in northwestern riparian systems.

AB  - In the past, transhumant pastoralists in the Indian Himalaya used resources available in various subsystems for their livelihoods. Recent sedentarization of a section of the transhumant pastoralist population resulted in competition with the existing sedentary population for resources in some areas. Resources such as grazing areas and forests are becoming less productive and can no longer cover growing demand (both human and livestock). In the Niti valley (Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve [NDBR] buffer zone), changes in government policies during the past 50 years have produced a land-use system that is not conducive to traditional transhumant pastoralism. The present article analyzes the impact of loss of grazing area on transhumant pastoralism, the current state of monetary return from livestock rearing, and the output-input ratio in terms of energy currencies in villages inhabited by transhumant pastoralist populations and villages now practicing sedentarized lifestyles. Although small ruminant-dominated animal husbandry is providing monetary benefits to local populations, the system is consuming more resources than it produces in terms of energy currencies. The prospects for transhumant pastoralism in the buffer zone villages of NDBR are discussed.

AB  - Filter strips or buffers are areas of grass or other perennial herbaceous vegetation established along waterways to remove contaminants and sediments from agricultural field runoff. In the heavily cultivated regions of the Midwestern United States, these buffer zones established under the Farm Bill provide important habitat for wildlife such as butterflies. The question of how the landscape context of these plantings influences their use has not been adequately researched. We used multiple regression and Akaike's Information Criteria to determine how habitat width and several landscape-level factors (i.e., landscape composition [total herbaceous cover, amount of developed area, and amount of wooded cover] and configuration [herbaceous edge density]) influenced the abundance and diversity of the butterfly community using filter strips in southwestern Minnesota, USA. Habitat-sensitive butterfly abundance and all richness and diversity measures were positively correlated with filter-strip width. Butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the amount of developed areas (cities, towns, and roads) within the area of a 1-km radius ($3.14 km^2$) surrounding the sites. Percentage of wooded cover in the landscape was an important variable explaining individual species abundance, although the direction of the relationship varied. Our finding that landscape context influences butterfly use of filter strips highlights the importance of landscape-level approaches to wildlife conservation in agroecosystems.

AB  - Mitigating nutrient losses from anthropogenic nonpoint sources is today of particular importance for improving the water quality of numerous freshwater lakes worldwide. Several empirical relationships between land use and in-lake water quality variables have been developed, but they are often weak, which can in part be attributed to lack of detailed information about land use activities or point sources. We examined a comprehensive data set comprising land use data, point-source information, and in-lake water quality for 414 Danish lakes. By excluding point-source-influenced lakes (n = 210), the strength in relationship (R 2 ) between in-lake total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and the proportion of agricultural land use in the watershed increased markedly, from 10&#x2013;12% to 39&#x2013;42% for deep lakes and from 10&#x2013;12% to 21&#x2013;23% for shallow lakes, with the highest increase for TN. Relationships between TP and agricultural land use were even stronger for lakes with rivers in their watershed (55%) compared to lakes without (28%), indicating that rivers mediate a stronger linkage between landscape activity and lake water quality by providing a "delivery" mechanism for excess nutrients in the watershed. When examining the effect of different near-freshwater land zones in contrast to the entire watershed, relationships generally improved with size of zone (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m from the edge of lake and streams) but were by far strongest using the entire watershed. The proportion of agricultural land use in the entire watershed was best in explaining lake water quality, both relative to estimated nutrient surplus at agricultural field level and near-lake land use, which somewhat contrasts typical strategies of management policies that mainly target agricultural nutrient applications and implementation of near-water buffer zones. This study suggests that transport mechanisms within the whole catchment are important for the nutrient export to lakes. Hence, the whole watershed should be considered when managing nutrient loadings to lakes, and future policies should ideally target measures that reduce the proportion of cultivated land in the watershed to successfully improve lake water quality.

AB  - The creation of temporal and newly sown field margins for 6 years is a common agri-environment scheme (AES) in the Netherlands. Conservation profits resulting from AES vary over different areas and need further studying. We examined plant species richness in such field margins and adjacent ditch banks in the province of Zeeland, where these linear elements do not experience plant biomass removal after mowing as management strategy. First, during 2 years, we inventoried field margins sown with a wildflower mixture and related the species composition and richness to the age of the margins. In a second assessment, we studied plant species richness on ditch banks protected from arable fields by these margins. Major clusters in a principal component analysis (PCA) on species composition in the field margins showed a succession from sown and ruderal annual species (year 1), to sown perennial species (year 2) and ending with a dominance by tussock forming grass species and Urtica dioica (year 5-6). Total plant species richness decreased with increasing age of the margins, and this was caused by the combination of a decline in sown species and a stable number of not-sown species. The presence of field margins during several years did not result in an increase in plant species richness on adjacent ditch banks. In both the field margins and on the ditch banks, mowing management is not followed by the removal of the cuttings. For plant conservation, the results of these field margins are disappointing, probably due to the lack of a proper management. Therefore, we recommend implementing a haymaking and opening management, to increase plant richness and to reduce noxious weeds in the margins and on the ditch banks.

AB  - 1. Habitat features and macroinvertebrate communities were surveyed in 66 predominantly upland streams throughout Wales and Scotland to assess the efficacy of riparian management (as `buffer strips') in protecting stream resources during commercial forestry. 2. Habitat data were reduced by principal components analysis (PCA). Macroinvertebrates in the stream margins and riffles were considered separately, and ordination of the community data was by DECORANA. 3. Habitat gradients recognized between the streams from PCA included trends in size, ionic strength, acidity, substratum type, and in the characteristics of marginal habitats. The latter represented a change from margins dominated by `soft' vegetation features to margins composed of `hard' features such as tree roots, rock and stones. 4. Marginal habitat characteristics differed between streams with different riparian management. Streams with `harder' margins occurred where the banks were covered with either conifers or broadleaves. Streams with `softer' margins occurred in seminatural moorland, and where a `buffer strip' of moorland vegetation had been retained along the stream at the planting stage. Streams in conifer forest in which a riparian buffer strip had been cleared retrospectively were intermediate. 5. For any given pH, aluminium concentrations were significantly higher in streams draining conifer catchments than in streams draining whole catchments of moorland or deciduous woodland. This effect occurred irrespective of buffer strips in conifer catchments. 6. The taxon richnesses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and all taxa combined, in both riffles and margins, declined significantly with increasing acidity and aluminium concentration. Primary ordination axes from both habitats correlated with taxon richness, and hence also with pH and aluminium. However, there were significant effects on the ordination scores by riparian management, due mostly to reduced taxon richnesses in conifer sites without buffer strips. Significant effects remained even after accounting for increased aluminium concentration at conifer sites. 7. We conclude that gradients related to acidity are dominant correlates with the composition of invertebrate communities in upland British streams. However, riparian management can influence stream habitat structure and, to some extent, the macroinvertebrate fauna in the stream margins. Buffer strips consisting of broadleaf trees and moorland/grassland vegetation have different effects on taxonomic composition and abundance. They are most effective when implemented at the planting stage, though further data are required to assess succession with time where buffer strips have been cleared retrospectively.

AB  - "Interface" organizations are groups created to foster the use of science in environmental policy, management, and education. Here we compare interface organizations that differ in spatial scale, modes of operation, and intended audience to illustrate their diversity and importance in promoting the application of science to environmental issues. There has been exciting recent growth in the nature and extent of activities by interface organizations and in new methods for science communication and engagement. These developments can help scientists &#x2014; who face personal and institutional challenges when attempting to convey the results of their research to various audiences &#x2014; interact with society on specific issues in specific places, and with a wide range of non-traditional audiences. The ongoing mission for these organizations should be to move beyond simply increasing awareness of environmental problems to the creation of solutions that result in genuine environmental improvements.

AB  - 1. An understanding of how farming practices in adjacent fields and the dimensions of the hedge and other components of the boundary affect birds is essential for efficient conservation management of field boundaries. This paper is based upon surveys of field boundary transects at two sites in eastern England. 2. The first study, near Huntingdon (1983-85), was based upon a range of field boundaries, from small ditches to tall hedges. The boundaries were between small pasture, small arable or large arable fields. 3. The second study, at Swavesey (1985-87), covered the various permutations of boundary structure, and adjacent cropping, available within a catchment of a tributary of the River Great Ouse. This study also included a range of drainage regimes. 4. Regression models were used to relate measures of bird species richness, in both winter and summer over several years, to field boundary attributes, including adjacent land use. 5. Bird variables were positively correlated with the physical size of the hedge, the number and height of trees and adjacent permanent pasture. These attributes accounted for most of the observed variation in bird variables. Ditch and verge dimensions played a statistically significant but relatively less important role. 6. Field boundary management options, beneficial for bird conservation with relatively little agricultural cost, are presented.

AB  - 1. An earlier paper related bird species richness to hedgerows and other field boundary attributes including adjacent land use. The study was over several years (winter and summer) at two sites, Huntingdon and Swavesey, in East Anglia UK. 2. The present paper deals with similar relationships, but the bird variables used are the abundance of individual species, of groups of species (all finches, all raptors, etc.) and of all birds, as well as Simpson's index of diversity. This required extensive modelling - 105 models for Huntingdon and 174 for Swavesey. 3. The results of all 279 models are presented in a condensed form, highlighting the importance of given field boundary attributes to particular species or groups of species. 4. Like bird species richness in the earlier paper, the abundance of many species was strongly influenced by the land use, and by the main vegetation variables (tree height and number, hedgerow length, height and width). Land use was important to a larger majority of species, the exceptions being carrion crow, pheasant, reed bunting and wren. 5. Verge width appeared important for small insectivores (blue tit) and was particularly important for seed eating birds, e.g. most finches and buntings, red-legged partridge in summer, and carrion crow and skylark in winter. 6. Ditch dimensions were associated with the abundance of some seed eaters (linnet, reed bunting and goldfinch) and insectivores (blackbird, great tit, skylark, song thrush and wren). Kestrel and the groups raptors, corvids, waders and aquatics were associated with large ditches. 7. Though the general management prescriptions to benefit the majority of farmland birds were found to be similar to those in the earlier paper, the detailed species specific modelling made it possible to examine the habitat requirements of particular species. 8. Ecological evaluation of the results from the two studies are presented in a form considered to be of value for practical management. Bird species and groups of birds are categorised with respect to their likely requirements of particular attributes of the field boundaries.

AB  - We examined the relative importance of riparian vs. upland habitats to breeding birds by comparing species abundance, richness, and similarity of bird communities in managed Douglas-fir forests in western Washington State, USA. We also examined whether forested buffer strips along second-and third-order streams effectively maintain the pre-logging riparian breeding bird community by comparing species abundance, richness, and turnover among three treatments: (1) unharvested controls; (2) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a narrow (~14 m) forested buffer on both sides of the stream; and (3) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a wide (~31 m) forested buffer along both sides of the stream. Deciduous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and other deciduous shrubs less common in adjacent upland forest characterized streamside zones. Despite different vegetation features, riparian and upland habitats did not differ in any measures of bird species richness and composition. No species or species group was more abundant in the upland. Neotropical migrants, resident species, and species associated with deciduous trees and shrubs in forested habitats were more abundant in riparian habitats than in adjacent uplands. Total bird abundance and abundance of four species (American Robin [Turdus migratorius], Pacific-slope Flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], Black-throated Gray Warbler [Dendroica nigrescens], and Winter Wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) were higher in riparian habitats. Abundance of these riparian associates was correlated with percent cover of berry-producing shrubs and the number of deciduous trees in the canopy. We found that the number of breeding bird species on sites with narrow buffers increased from slightly fewer than controls before harvest to an average of 10 more species than controls after harvest, a change reflected in an average 20% increase in species turnover on narrow-buffer sites relative to controls. Total bird abundance did not differ between treatments and controls. Resident species, those species associated with shrubs in forested habitats and conifer trees, declined on both buffer treatments. Species associated with upland and riparian forests (Black-throated Gray Warbler, Golden-crowned Kinglet [Regulus satrapa], and Brown Creeper [Certhia americana]) decreased in abundance on riparian buffer treatments relative to controls, whereas species associated with open, shrubby habitats (Dark-eyed Junco [Junco hyemalis], Cedar Waxwing [Bombycilla cedrorum], and Song Sparrow [Melospiza melodia]) increased in abundance on one or both riparian buffer treatments. High species turnover on narrow-buffer treatments indicated that buffers <14.m on each side of the stream did not maintain the pre-logging bird community. There was little difference in species turnover or species richness between the wide-buffer treatment and the control, indicating that a 30-m buffer on both sides of second-order and third-order streams maintains most of the pre-logging bird community in the first two years postharvest. The Black-throated Gray Warbler was the only riparian associate to decline on both the narrow- and wide-buffer treatments; its abundance was positively correlated with buffer width, and a buffer &#x2265;45 m wide on each side of second- and third-order streams was needed to support populations at densities found on unharvested controls. To maintain the entire breeding bird community associated with forested riparian habitats in the coastal Northwest, we recommend a minimum buffer of 45 m along both sides of second- and third-order streams. Habitat features such as deciduous trees (Alnus rubra and Acer macrophyllum) and berry-producing shrubs (especially Rubus spectabilis) appear to be important and should be maintained within forested riparian buffer strips. This study documents short-term effects of riparian treatments on the breeding bird community, which may take several years to respond to habitat manipulations. Thus, we recommend continued monitoring to assess long-term effects of buffer width reduction.

AB  - Hardwood forests and plantations are an important economic resource for the forest products industry worldwide and to the international trade of lumber and logs. Hardwood trees are also planted for ecological reasons, for example, wildlife habitat, native woodland restoration, and riparian buffers. The demand for quality hardwood from tree plantations will continue to rise as the worldwide consumption of forest products increases. Tree improvement of temperate hardwoods has lagged behind that of coniferous species and hardwoods of the genera Populus and Eucalyptus. The development of marker systems has become an almost necessary complement to the classical breeding and improvement of hardwood tree populations for superior growth, form, and timber characteristics. Molecular markers are especially valuable for determining the reproductive biology and population structure of natural forests and plantations, and the identity of genes affecting quantitative traits. Clonal reproduction of commercially important hardwood tree species provides improved planting stock for use in progeny testing and production forestry. Development of in vitro and conventional vegetative propagation methods allows mass production of clones of mature, elite genotypes or genetically improved genotypes. Genetic modification of hardwood tree species could potentially produce trees with herbicide tolerance, disease and pest resistance, improved wood quality, and reproductive manipulations for commercial plantations. This review concentrates on recent advances in conventional breeding and selection, molecular marker application, in vitro culture, and genetic transformation, and discusses the future challenges and opportunities for valuable temperate (or "fine") hardwood tree improvement.

AB  - 1. This study estimated the importance of in situ denitrification in the nitrate buffering capacities of a riparian forest. 2. Spatial and temporal patterns of in situ denitrification were investigated along a riparian catena. 3. Highest rates of in situ denitrification (up to 78 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) were measured in the riparian forest soils in late winter and early spring. Lowest rates (3 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) were measured in summer and autumn. 4. Whatever the season considered, 30 m of riparian buffer strip were enough to remove all the nitrates coming through the groundwater. 5. Rehabilitation of riparian zones with riparian vegetation together with the maintenance of waterlogged conditions induced by riverflow regulation appear to be a good point from which to start the restoration of buffering capacities of river ecosystems against nitrogen loads.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips may protect streams from phosphorus (P) pollution. We compared 2 years of daily P-yield ($\mu {\rm g}\ {\rm m}^{-2}\ \text{day}^{-1}$) from six southeast Wisconsin watersheds with contrasting riparian buffer attributes. Of the variables measured, mean daily P-yield was most closely correlated with the variability in riparian patch size. Variability in P-yield was most closely correlated with characteristics of the riparian buffer, such as percent wetland land cover, riparian continuity, and stream sinuosity. During the most extreme events, mean P-yield was negatively correlated with the percentage of wetland land cover in the upland watershed. Correlations suggest that riparian continuity may influence P-loading in these watersheds. Our results corroborate the importance of continuity and uniformity of riparian buffers as moderators of P flow from upland agricultural lands into streams.

AB  -.&#x2003; Riparian buffers provide improved protection for water quality and biota, and narrow, fixed-width buffers of native vegetation along streams have been used to mitigate the effects of forest harvest at least since the 1960s. The practice of leaving unmanaged strips of vegetation along water courses in agricultural lands had been used before the 1960s in southern Europe and in eastern North America, but the scientific basis for leaving riparian buffers on forested lands came from observations in the coastal temperate rainforests of western North America. Those observations often were applied to other forested landscapes without further considerations. Fixed-width buffers are administratively simple to implement and assess, and have come to be the norm for streamside protection from forestry. Most guidelines for streamside protection allow some local modification for site and watershed-scale considerations, but frequently, the option to deviate from fixed-width buffers is not exercised because of uncertainty about outcomes. Few experiments have been done to test the efficacy of buffers of a particular width or of site- or landscape-specific modifications.

AB  - Agricultural land use has often been linked to nutrient enrichment, habitat degradation, hydrologie alteration, and loss of biotic integrity in streams. The U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment Program sampled 226 stream sites located in eight agriculture-dominated study units across the United States to investigate the geographic variability and causes of agricultural impacts on stream biotic integrity. In this analysis we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to develop a national and set of regional causal models linking agricultural land use to measured instream conditions. We then examined the direct, indirect, and total effects of agriculture on biotic integrity as it acted through multiple water quality and habitat pathways. In our nation-wide model, cropland affected benthic communities by both altering structural habitats and by imposing water quality-related stresses. Region-specific modeling demonstrated that geographic context altered the relative importance of causal pathways through which agricultural activities affected stream biotic integrity. Cropland had strong negative total effects on the invertebrate community in the national, Midwest, and Western models, but a very weak effect in the Eastern Coastal Plain model. In the Western Arid and Eastern Coastal Plain study regions, cropland impacts were transmitted primarily through dissolved water quality contaminants, but in the Midwestern region, they were transmitted primarily through particulate components of water quality. Habitat effects were important in the Western Arid model, but negligible in the Midwest and Eastern Coastal Plain models. The relative effects of riparian forested wetlands also varied regionally, having positive effects on biotic integrity in the Eastern Coastal Plain and Western Arid region models, but no statistically significant effect in the Midwest. These differences in response to cropland and riparian cover suggest that best management practices and planning for the mitigation of agricultural land use impacts on stream ecosystems should be regionally focused.

AB  - Water pollution from nonpoint sources is increasingly a focal point for efforts to reduce water quality impairments. These efforts often require or subsidize riparian buffer strips. However, the costs of these buffer strips are not always well understood. This article estimates the annualized costs of establishing and maintaining 45.7-meter (150-feet) riparian buffer strips on all agricultural land adjoining a waterway in Tennessee's Harpeth River watershed. A mandatory requirement for buffer strips of this width would result in 4,955 hectares (12,245 acres) of buffer strips at an annualized cost of $1.3 million. A supply curve for buffer strips is also constructed.

AB  - Outdoor recreation and ecotourism can have negative effects on wildlife species, so it is important to determine buffer zones within which activities near critical wildlife areas are limited. We exposed 23 species of waterbirds (Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes, Falconiformes, Charadriiformes) to the direct approach of a personal watercraft (PWC) and an outboard-powered boat to determine their flush distances. We used 11 sites with a mixture of low, moderate, and high amounts of human activity along the east and west coasts of Florida during September-November 1998 and April-June 1999. We detected considerable variation in flush distances among individuals within the same species and among species in response to both types of vessels. Average flush distances for the PWC ranged from 19.5 m (Least Tern [Sterna antillarum]) to 49.5 m (Osprey [Pandion haliaetus]), whereas average flush distances for the outboard-powered boat ranged from 23.4 m (Forster's Tern [S. forsteri]) to 57.9 m (Osprey). Larger species generally exhibited greater average flush distances for both types of watercraft. A comparison of the flush distances elicited by each watercraft indicated that only the Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) exhibited significantly larger flush distances (t test, p < 0.01) in response to the approach of the PWC than in response to the outboard, whereas four species (Anhinga [Anhinga anhinga], Little Blue Heron [Egretta caerulea], Willet [Catoptrophorus semipalmatus], and Osprey) exhibited significantly larger flush distances (t test, p < 0.05) in response to the approach of the outboard-powered boat than in response to the PWC. Eleven species (68.8%) showed no significant difference (t test, p > 0.05) in their flush distances in response to the fast-moving PWC and the outboard-powered boat. Our data suggest that a single buffer-zone distance can be developed for both PWC and outboard-powered vessels. Buffer zones of 180 m for wading birds, 140 m for terns and gulls, 100 m for plovers and sandpipers, and 150 m for ospreys would minimize their disturbance at foraging and loafing sites in Florida.

AB  - We exposed 13 species of waterbirds (Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes, Falconiformes) to the direct approach of an airboat to determine their flush distances. Five lakes with different levels of airboat activity were visited in central Florida during April-August 1999 to 2001. We detected considerable variation in flush distances among individuals within the same species and significant differences among species in response to an airboat. Average flush distances among all species ranged from 49 m for the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) to 172 m for the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Average flush distances among herons ranged from 65 m for the Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor) to 113 m for the Great Egret (Ardea alba). Larger species generally exhibited greater average flush distances. A comparison of the flush distances elicited by a fast moving outboard-powered boat and an airboat indicated that all nine species exhibited significantly greater flush distances to the approach of an airboat. Recommended buffer zones that would minimize disturbance of waterbirds while foraging and loafing ranged from about 130 m (Snail Kite) to 365 m (Bald Eagle) for raptors and 165 m (Tricolored Heron) to 255 m (Great Egret) for wading birds.

AB  - Sixteen species of waterbirds (Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes, Charadriiformes) in north and central Florida were exposed to 4 types of human disturbances (walking, all-terrain vehicle, automobile, boat) to determine buffer zones that minimize flushing of foraging or loafing birds. Both intraspecific and interspecific variation were observed in flushing-response distances to the same type of disturbance. Buffer zones were estimated using a formula based on the mean plus 1.6495 standard deviations of the observed flushing distance plus 40 m (buffer distance = exp [&#x3bc; + 1.6495&#x3c3;] + 40). A buffer of about 100 m should minimize disturbance to most species of waterbirds we studied in Florida. We recommend follow-up studies to test our buffer distances for other species and disturbance situations.

AB  - Riparian areas alone are often insufficient for preservation of riparian taxa. Case studies on many vertebrate taxa have addressed the importance of establishing buffer zones around riparian habitats. The goal of this investigation was to build upon previous studies and assess the relative importance of buffer zones to riparian snakes. A case study was conducted on a Cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma) population within a stream/riparian habitat. Using radio-telemetry, I examined the spatial distribution of males, gravid females, and non-gravid females. Although 83% of all snake observations were within 10 m of the stream, population subunits exhibited different patterns of spatial use. Gravid females provided most of the distant observations, inhabiting the surrounding terrestrial habitat up to 94 m from the shoreline. Thus, disturbances to terrestrial areas surrounding the riparian habitat would likely have the greatest impact on gravid females. These results further establish a need for buffer zones around riparian ecosystems, and highlight the importance of considering spatial use differences between population subunits when outlining buffer zone applications for conservation management.

AB  - The effects of management of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops on adjacent field margins were assessed for 59 maize, 66 beet and 67 spring oilseed rape sites. Fields were split into halves, one being sown with a GMHT crop and the other with the equivalent conventional non-GMHT crop. Margin vegetation was recorded in three components of the field margins. Most differences were in the tilled area, with fewer smaller effects mirroring them in the verge and boundary. In spring oilseed rape fields, the cover, flowering and seeding of plants were 25%, 44% and 39% lower, respectively, in the GMHT uncropped tilled margins. Similarly, for beet, flowering and seeding were 34% and 39% lower, respectively, in the GMHT margins. For maize, the effect was reversed, with plant cover and flowering 28% and 67% greater, respectively, in the GMHT half. Effects on butterflies mirrored these vegetation effects, with 24% fewer butterflies in margins of GMHT spring oilseed rape. The likely cause is the lower nectar supply in GMHT tilled margins and crop edges. Few large treatment differences were found for bees, gastropods or other invertebrates. Scorching of vegetation by herbicide-spray drift was on average 1.6% on verges beside conventional crops and 3.7% beside GMHT crops, the difference being significant for all three crops.

AB  - To better understand the distribution and abundance of headwater-stream salamanders in managed conifer forests, we examined relationships between Cascade torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton cascadae) and biotic and abiotic habitat attributes at landscape and within-stream levels in western Oregon, USA. In 2001 we found 145 torrent salamanders in 25% of 59 headwater (first-order) streams from randomly selected <tex-math>$2.58\text{-}{\rm km}^{2}$</tex-math> sections of the study area. Landscape-level variation in torrent salamander distribution and relative abundance were related to the age of adjacent riparian forests and to the landform features parent geology and stream aspect. In 2002 we conducted a more detailed study of salamander occurrence and abundance within 49 10-m stream reaches, stratified by gradient, that were randomly selected from 15 streams known to contain salamanders. We recorded 475 salamanders from 33 (67%) of the stream reaches. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) model selection indicated that a streambed substrate model best explained salamander occupancy in stream reaches, but a model containing only the parameter distance to stream origin and another model containing abiotic landform features also received strong empirical support. In contrast, the distance to stream origin model was the best candidate model explaining reach-level salamander abundance. However, 2 additional models explaining abundance, including one that discriminated between the northern and southern portions of our study area and another that reflected stream reach habitat parameters, also received strong empirical support. Physical features of stream habitats appear to have an important influence on the distribution and abundance of torrent salamanders at multiple spatial scales, and these parameters should be addressed when designing management strategies (e.g., riparian buffers) to conserve these species.

AB  - Plantation forests were established on western Irish peatlands before it became apparent that riparian buffer zones were essential for the health of important salmonid habitats and aquatic ecosystems. The option to retrofit a riparian buffer zone several years before the clearfelling of the main plantation may lessen the possible effect of the clearfelling on receiving waters and provide some protection against sediment and nutrient runoff. The option to create a riparian buffer zone can only be considered if it can be shown that clearfelling this zone of coniferous forestry along the stream does not pose a significant risk to the water bodies in the short term. To assess this risk, the hydrology, water chemistry and biota at three locations in western peatland catchments within mature, harvestable-age forestry plantations were studied before, during and immediately after riparian buffer zones were created. Results indicate that water discharge and suspended sediment increased significantly at two experimental sites post-felling. Maximum and minimum daily temperature and pH also increased significantly at two of the sites. The biological results from macroinvertebrate analysis indicated some significant changes in richness and abundance of species post-felling. The juvenile trout (Salmo trutta L.) densities remained stable over the sampling period and appeared unaffected by the clearfelling operations.

AB  - Headwater streams and their riparian zones are a common, yet poorly understood, component of Pacific Northwest, USA, landscapes. We describe the ecological importance of headwater stream riparian zones as habitat for forest-floor invertebrate communities and assess how alternative management strategies for riparian zones may impact these communities. We compared community composition of forest-floor invertebrates at increasing distances along trans-riparian (stream edge to upslope) transects in mature forests, clearcuts, and riparian buffers of ~30-m width with upslope clearcuts. Invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps in five replicate blocks of three treatments each in the Willamette National Forest, Oregon, USA. We measured microclimate and microhabitat variables at pitfall locations. Despite strong elevation and block effects on community composition, community analyses revealed a distinct "riparian" invertebrate community within 1 m of the stream edge in mature forest treatments, which was strongly related to cool, humid microclimate conditions. Invertebrate community composition in buffer treatments was far more similar to that of mature forests than to clearcuts; a pattern mirrored by microclimate. These results suggest that, within our study sites, forest-floor invertebrate distributions are strongly associated with microclimate and that riparian buffers of ~30-m width do provide habitat for many riparian and forest species. Riparian reserves may serve as effective forest refugia and/or dispersal corridors for invertebrates and other taxa, and their incorporation into watershed management plans likely will contribute to meeting persistence and connectivity objectives.

AB  - We evaluated nitrogen (N) removal efficiency by riparian buffers at 14 sites scattered throughout seven European countries subject to a wide range of climatic conditions. The sites also had a wide range of nitrate inputs, soil characteristics, and vegetation types. Dissolved forms of N in groundwater and associated hydrological parameters were measured at all sites; these data were used to calculate nitrate removal by the riparian buffers. Nitrate removal rates (expressed as the difference between the input and output nitrate concentration in relation to the width of the riparian zone) were mainly positive, ranging from $5\%\ {\rm m}^{-1}$ to $30\%\ {\rm m}^{-1}$, except for a few sites where the values were close to zero. Average N removal rates were similar for herbaceous $(4.43\%\ {\rm m}^{-1})$ and forested $(4.21\%\ {\rm m}^{-1})$ sites. Nitrogen removal efficiency was not affected by climatic variation between sites, and no significant seasonal pattern was detected. When nitrate inputs were low, a very large range of nitrate removal efficiencies was found both in the forested and in the nonforested sites. However, sites receiving nitrate inputs above $5\ {\rm mg}\ {\rm N}\ {\rm L}^{-1}$ showed an exponential negative decay of nitrate removal efficiency $(\text{nitrate removal efficiency}=33.6\ {\rm e}^{-0.11\ {\rm NO}_{3}\ \text{input}},r^{2}=0.33,P<0.001)$. Hydraulic gradient was also negatively related to nitrate removal (r = -0.27, P < 0.05) at these sites. On the basis of this intersite comparison, we conclude that the removal of nitrate by biological mechanisms (for example, denitrification, plant uptake) in the riparian areas is related more closely to nitrate load and hydraulic gradient than to climatic parameters.

AB  - Many semi-aquatic organisms, such as salamanders, depend on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their life cycle and maintain viable populations. But current U.S. federal and state regulations protect only the wetland itself or arbitrarily defined portions of terrestrial habitat, if any. Part of the reason terrestrial habitats adjacent to wetlands are not protected is the lack of a clear understanding of the distances from shorelines that are biologically relevant to wetland fauna. Such information is critical for delineation of terrestrial "buffer zones" for wetlands, and thus for the conservation of semi-aquatic organisms. I summarized data from the literature on terrestrial habitat use by one group of pond-breeding salamanders, especially distances individuals traveled away from ponds. The results provide a basis for setting terrestrial buffer zones determined from actual habitat use by adult and juvenile salamanders. The mean distance salamanders were found from the edge of aquatic habitats was 125.3 m for adults of six species and 69.6 m for juveniles of two of these species. Assuming that the mean distance encompasses 50% of the population, a buffer zone encompassing 95% of the population would extend 164.3 m (534 ft) from a wetland's edge into the terrestrial habitat. Data from other amphibians suggest that this buffer zone is applicable to a range of species, but caution should be taken for taxa suspected to be more vagile. Wetland managers and policymakers must recognize the special needs of semi-aquatic organisms during their entire life cycle, not just during the breeding season. To maintain viable populations and communities of salamanders, attention must be directed to the terrestrial areas peripheral to all wetlands. Data on habitat use from salamanders and other semi-aquatic species make it increasingly apparent that maintaining the connection between wetlands and terrestrial habitats will be necessary to preserve the remaining biodiversity of our vanishing wetlands.

AB  - Terrestrial habitats surrounding wetlands are critical to the management of natural resources. Although the protection of water resources from human activities such as agriculture, silviculture, and urban development is obvious, it is also apparent that terrestrial areas surrounding wetlands are core habitats for many semiaquatic species that depend on mesic ecotones to complete their life cycle. For purposes of conservation and management, it is important to define core habitats used by local breeding populations surrounding wetlands. Our objective was to provide an estimate of the biologically relevant size of core habitats surrounding wetlands for amphibians and reptiles. We summarize data from the literature on the use of terrestrial habitats by amphibians and reptiles associated with wetlands (19 frog and 13 salamander species representing 1363 individuals; 5 snake and 28 turtle species representing more than 2245 individuals). Core terrestrial habitat ranged from 159 to 290 m for amphibians and from 127 to 289 m for reptiles from the edge of the aquatic site. Data from these studies also indicated the importance of terrestrial habitats for feeding, overwintering, and nesting, and, thus, the biological interdependence between aquatic and terrestrial habitats that is essential for the persistence of populations. The minimum and maximum values for core habitats, depending on the level of protection needed, can be used to set biologically meaningful buffers for wetland and riparian habitats. These results indicate that large areas of terrestrial habitat surrounding wetlands are critical for maintaining biodiversity.

AB  - The effects of habitat edges on nest survival of shrubland birds, many of which have experienced significant declines in the eastern United States, have not been thoroughly studied. In 2007 and 2008, we collected data on nests of 5 shrubland passerine species in 12 early successional forest patches in North Carolina, USA. We used model selection methods to assess the effect of distance to cropland and mature forest edge on nest pr&#xe9;dation rates and additionally accounted for temporal trends, nest stage, vegetation structure, and landscape context. For nests of all species combined, nest pr&#xe9;dation decreased with increasing distance to cropland edge, by nearly 50% at 250 m from the cropland edge. Nest pr&#xe9;dation of all species combined also was higher in patches with taller saplings and less understory vegetation, especially in the second year of our study when trees were 4-6 m tall. Pr&#xe9;dation of field sparrow (Spize Ila pusilla) nests was lower in landscapes with higher agricultural landcover. Nest pr&#xe9;dation risk for shrubland birds appears to be greater near agricultural edges than mature forest edges, and natural forest succession may drive patterns of local extirpation of shrubland birds in early successional forest patches. Thus, we suggest that habitat patches managed for shrubland bird populations should be considerably large or wide (>250 m) when adjacent to crop fields and maintained in structurally diverse early serai stages.

AB  - Catchment and riparian degradation has resulted in declining ecosystem health of streams worldwide. With restoration a priority in many regions, there is an increasing interest in the scale at which land use influences stream ecosystem health. Our goal was to use a substantial data set collected as part of a monitoring program (the Southeast Queensland, Australia, Ecological Health Monitoring Program data set, collected at 116 sites over six years) to identify the spatial scale of land use, or the combination of spatial scales, that most strongly influences overall ecosystem health. In addition, we aimed to determine whether the most influential scale differed for different aspects of ecosystem health. We used linear-mixed models and a Bayesian model-averaging approach to generate models for the overall aggregated ecosystem health score and for each of the five component indicators (fish, macroinvertebrates, water quality, nutrients, and ecosystem processes) that make up the score. Dense forest close to the survey site, mid-dense forest in the hydrologically active nearstream areas of the catchment, urbanization in the riparian buffer, and tree cover at the reach scale were all significant in explaining ecosystem health, suggesting an overriding influence of forest cover, particularly close to the stream. Season and antecedent rainfall were also important explanatory variables, with some land-use variables showing significant seasonal interactions. There were also differential influences of land use for each of the component indicators. Our approach is useful given that restoring general ecosystem health is the focus of many stream restoration projects; it allowed us to predict the scale and catchment position of restoration that would result in the greatest improvement of ecosystem health in the regions streams and rivers. The models we generated suggested that good ecosystem health can be maintained in catchments where 80% of hydrologically active areas in close proximity to the stream have mid-dense forest cover and moderate health can be obtained with 60% cover.

AB  - This study investigates methods to rejuvenate the flora of previously degraded field margins on a pastoral farm in County Longford. We also assess the effects of individual treatments on the abundance of various orders of invertebrates recorded within the experimental plots. Field margin treatments were 1.5m-wide unfenced control margins, 1.5m-wide fenced margins or 3.5m-wide fenced margins. Nutrient inputs were excluded from all of the experimental plots. The botanical composition of the plots was examined on four occasions between 2002 and 2004 using permanent, nested quadrats. Emergence traps were used to measure invertebrate abundance within treatment plots and the main sward. Results indicated that 1) exclusion of nutrient inputs had a positive effect on plant species richness within the field margins; 2) plant species richness decreased with increased distance from the hedgerow; 3) herb species richness was greatest in the 1.5m closest to the hedgerow; 4) greater abundance of invertebrates occurred within the 3.5m-wide margins; 5) successful control of Pteridium aquilinum was achieved through spot treatment with the selective herbicide 'Asulox'; and 6) a combination of management techniques such as cutting and grazing is likely to enhance plant species richness and facilitate the structural diversity of vegetation that is necessary for many invertebrate taxa.

AB  - The Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the western Himalaya has a high level of biological and cultural diversity. The Bhotiya community, whose livelihood is highly dependent on local natural resources, inhabits the buffer zone of NDBR. Bhotiya practice seasonal and altitudinal migration and stay inside the buffer zone of NDBR for only 6 months (May-October). A survey was conducted in 1996 in 5 villages in Pithoragarh District of the buffer zone, where Bhotiya cultivate medicinal plants on their agriculture fields. The aim of the survey was to understand the socioeconomics of medicinal plant cultivation and evaluate the future prospects of this practice in promoting sustainable development among the local community. Of a total of 71 families, 90% cultivated medicinal plants on 78% of the total reported cultivated area (15.29 ha). At the time of the survey, a total of 12 species of medicinal plants were under cultivation, of which 6 were being marketed while the remaining 6 were still under nursery plantation for future propagation. On average, a family earns about Rs.2423 &#xb1; 376.95 per season from the sale of medicinal plants (Rs.38 = US$1 in 1996). Based on the average productivity (kg/ha/y), we estimated that an average family could earn between Rs.4362 and Rs.86,500 from the sale of medicinal herbs. Encouragement of medicinal plant cultivation at high altitudes in the Himalayas would help to generate better monetary returns as well as conserve these herbs in the wild and preserve traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge among local people.

AB  - Logging, deforestation and oil palm plantations have increased forest fragmentation in Borneo. Given the extent of forest loss and logging, evaluating the ability of remnant forests, especially fragments and riparian buffers, to provide aboveground biomass (AGB) storage and retain tree biodiversity is essential. This paper examines the variation in AGB stocks and tree species richness of riparian buffers located in forests of different disturbance intensities situated at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystem (SAFE) site in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Disturbance intensities ranged from pristine old growth forests to oil palm monocultures. The AGB of riparian buffers showed no significant variation between riparian buffers located in unlogged, once-logged and twice-logged forests but underwent sharp decline in heavily logged forests and oil palm (OP) plantations. However, riparian zones located within OP plantations exhibited significantly higher AGB than that of OP monoculture plantations. OP riparian buffers had the highest species richness although most were small, successional species. The retention of riparian buffers in OP plantations can yield AGB storage benefits while maintaining speciesrich assemblages of trees.

AB  - 1. The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity. These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna. 2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire, UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut, herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type. 3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae, Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop. 4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities, although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity.

AB  - Riparian buffers can be valuable refuge areas for wildlife in otherwise homogeneous agricultural landscapes. Government sponsored programs like the Cropland Reserve Program generally require the planting of specific vegetative species during buffer restoration, although the effectiveness of such an approach when compared to restoration by volunteer species is unknown. We studied the effect of differences in vegetation structure on avian habitat in riparian buffer zones. A 25 m (82 ft) wide planted woodland buffer, 30 m (98 ft) wide grass, shrub, and woodland three-zone buffer, and a 9 m (30 ft) wide shrub buffer were evaluated for habitat potential using breeding-bird counts and vegetation surveys. Bird density and species richness varied with the structure of the vegetative communities present at the three sites. Avian species richness and total detections were higher in the three-zone buffer than in both the shrub and planted buffer, likely a result of the diversity of vegetation at the site. These data suggest that restoration of riparian areas by allowing fallow vegetation to recolonize is at the very least equally beneficial to avian wildlife as is restoration by planting specific grass, shrub, and tree species. Buffer restoration by natural revegetation using this method could be recommended as an alternative to implementation by planting riparian species due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness.

AB  - In an effort to provide wildlife habitat and link blocks of forested habitat, coastal forested buffer strips in the Pacific Northwest are managed to mitigate effects of fragmentation that result from timber harvesting adjacent to a coastline. We examined the effect of coastal forest buffer strip width on avian nest survival on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, in 2003 and 2004. We established nest monitoring plots in two buffer width treatments, narrow (<250 m, n = 4) and wide (>350 m, n = 3), and monitored a total of 142 nests of six species: the Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Chestnut-backed Chickadee (Poecile rufescens), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus), and Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius). We modeled and compared the daily survival rate (DSR) of each species in both buffer width treatments. Point estimates for DSRs were slightly higher within wide buffers, but confidence intervals overlapped for all species. Overall, Pacific-slope Flycatchers had the highest nest success (87%) and Varied Thrushes had the lowest (22%). In addition, we used an information-theoretic approach to examine support for hypotheses concerning the effects of edge on nest survival of the Hermit Thrush, the only species for which we had sufficient data. Hermit Thrush nest survival was negatively affected by proximity to the coastline. Predators associated with the productive intertidal zone likely increase the predation risk of Hermit Thrush nests located near the coast.

AB  - The ecological knowledge and understanding of indigenous peoples and long-term settlers is heterogeneous and continually in flux as they adapt to ecological, political and economic changes. This research focuses on Khumbu Sherpa ecological knowledge and its relation to environmental decision-making. The Sherpa, Tibetan Buddhists who practice agro-pastoralism, provide tourism services to visitors of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone. Utilizing mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, I selected a stratified random sample of 100 individuals to assess spiritual values, and species and landscape knowledge. The results generally showed that individuals who lived on the tourist route and younger generations had less knowledge of these domains. These findings suggest that some Sherpa ecological knowledge and understanding had shifted from spiritual and agropastoralist socioeconomic values to a more tourismcentered economic logic. Future environmental decisions may be influenced by these changes.

AB  - Although riparian buffers are an important aspect of forest management in the boreal forest of Canada, little is known about the habitat conditions within buffers, due in part to complex edge effects in response to both the upland clearcut and the stream. We investigated microclimatic conditions and bryophyte growth and vitality in seven locations between the stream edge and 60 m into the upland undisturbed conifer forests and at the clearcut sites with riparian buffer 30 km northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that the growth and vitality of a pleurocarpous moss, Hylocomium splendens, and an acrocarpous moss, Polytrichum commune, would be directly related to the microclimatic gradients detected. We further hypothesized that sensitivity of the bryophytes to environmental factors will vary depending on their life form type, i.e., pleurocarpous moss will respond differently than the acrocarpous moss. Both bryophyte species were transplanted in pots and placed at 10-m intervals along 60-m transects perpendicular to the stream across the buffer and undisturbed sites. Bryophyte growth, cover, and vitality, as well as microclimatic parameters and plant cover, were measured over the summer in 2003. The riparian buffers were simultaneously affected by microclimatic gradients extending from both the clearcut edge and the riparian-upland ecotonal edge. Both bryophyte species responded to changes in the microclimatic conditions. However, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was the most important factor influencing the growth of H. splendens, whereas for P. commune growth soil moisture was most important. Our study confirms earlier findings that interior forest bryophytes such as H. splendens can be used as indicators to monitor edge effects and biodiversity recovery following forest harvesting. We demonstrate that growth and vitality of these bryophytes reflect the prevailing near-ground microclimatic conditions at the forest edges. Abundance estimates of such bryophytes can be used to determine the depth of edge effects across both ecotonal edges (e.g., riparian-upland forest edge) and anthropogenically created edges (e.g., clearcut edge). Forest management practices must consider depth of edge in determining the appropriate width of riparian buffers that would be necessary to sustain biodiversity and associated values at the land/water interface.

AB  - We studied riparian habitat use by a high density brown bear (Ursus arctos) population on the Tongass National Forest (Tongass) where spawning salmon (Oncorhyncus spp.) provide an important seasonal food resource. The Tongass contains large tracts of pristine old-growth coniferous forest and some of these tracts are within riparian zones that are subject to timber harvest and various timber management guidelines. Determining the size of protective riparian no-cut buffers to conserve fish and wildlife habitat and water quality was a major component of a revision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service's Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP; U.S. Forest Service 1997). We radiocollared 111 brown bears on a 1,119 km<sup>2</sup> portion of Chichagof Island to evaluate bear use of riparian habitats and to determine how proposed buffers might be used by brown bears. Our study area was managed for timber harvest and had>25 salmon spawning streams and associated riparian habitats with various riparian-zone management opportunities. Sixty-three percent of 2,069 aerial radiotelemetry locations were in riparian habitats during August and 61% of all August locations were <1,000 m from a salmon-spawning stream. The new Tongass forest plan has 2 types of administrative buffers on salmon streams: (1) a riparian standard and guideline, which is a variable-width buffer and usually incorporates <150 m of protection, and was established primarily to protect salmon habitat and water quality, and (2) a 153-m no-cut buffer established to protect foraging areas for brown bears. Twenty-four percent of the August locations were within the riparian standard and guideline buffer, and 39% fell within the brown bear buffer, assuming it was applied across all salmon spawning streams used by bears. These results were useful in revising the Tongass forest plan and in assisting decision-makers with the necessary information to change historic land allocations and provide more habitat conservation for brown bears. A panel of brown bear scientists recommended that a 153-m no-cut forest buffer be placed on all salmon spawning streams that are used by brown bears. The final forest plan weakened this recommendation, and its implementation will be subject to future interpretation. However, compared with previous forest planning efforts that had little protection of riparian habitats and none specifically for brown bears, this conclusion was an important measure for brown bear conservation.

AB  - Future economic growth and land development have the potential to produce tradeoffs in which economic values increase at the expense of environmental values. Although such tradeoffs have not been empirically verified in mountain ecosystems, they are likely to exist for an ecosystem containing abundant natural resources and environmental amenities that is undergoing rapid economic and population growth. Quantifying future tradeoffs between economic and environmental values is important because it provides information for natural resource managers and community planners that is useful in alleviating the adverse impacts of future growth and development on wildlife. Such tradeoffs are quantified for Flathead County, Montana, located in the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, using the Ecosystem Landscape Modeling System (ELMS). In particular, the ELMS is used for the following: (1) to simulate the extent of the tradeoffs between economic values (ie total output of goods and services) and wildlife habitat suitability (ie extent of habitat disturbance and the degree of loss in habitat security) in buffer zones for 5 protected areas in Flathead County between 2005 and 2024; and (2) to determine whether implementing a more restrictive land use policy than existed in 2005 would reduce future adverse impacts of growth and development on wildlife habitat. Simulation results indicate that future growth in Flathead County increases total output of goods and services, and the resulting land development reduces the suitability of wildlife habitat in the buffer zones. Degradation in habitat suitability can be alleviated by implementing a more restrictive land use policy. The methods used in the study provide a coarse assessment of the tradeoffs between economic values and wildlife habitat suitability in buffer zones for mountain protected areas.

AB  - We quantified rates of soil respiration among sites within an agricultural landscape in central lowa, USA. The study was conducted in riparian cool-season grass buffers, in re-established multispecies (switchgrass + poplar) riparian buffers and in adjacent crop (maize and soybean) fields. The objectives were to determine the variability in soil respiration among buffer types and crop fields within a riparian landscape, and to identify those factors correlating with the observed differences. Soil respiration was measured approximately monthly over a two-year period using the soda-lime technique. Mean daily soil respiration across all treatments ranged from 0.14 to 8.3 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; d&#x207b;&#xb9;. There were no significant differences between cool-season grass buffers and re-established forest buffers, but respiration rates beneath switchgrass were significantly lower than those beneath cool-season grass. Soil respiration was significantly greater in both buffer systems than in the cropped fields. Seasonal changes in soil respiration were strongly related to temperature changes. Over all sites, soil temperature and soil moisture together accounted for 69% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration. Annual soil respiration rates correlated strongly with soil organic carbon (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) and fine root (<2 mm) biomass (R = 0.85, P < 0.001). Annual soil respiration rates averaged 1140 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; for poplar, 1185 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; for cool-season grass, 1020 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; for switchgrass, 750 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; for soybean and 740 g C m&#x207b;&#xb2; for corn. Overall, vegetated buffers had significantly higher soil respiration rates than did adjacent crop fields, indicating greater soil biological activity within the buffers.

AB  - Severed human heads constitute one of the hallmarks of the Early Intermediate period of the Peruvian South Coast region. The ancient art of this region (including pottery and textiles) frequently portrays severed heads that are often associated with mythical beings. Actual heads, identified as trophies, have also been found in all the valleys of the region, suggesting that human decapitation and trophy head taking were important aspects of Early Intermediate period society on the South Coast. Notwithstanding the occurrence of trophies, decapitated human bodies are seldom found in the archaeological record. Recent archaeological excavations carried out at Amato, an Early Intermediate period site in the Acari Valley, resulted in the unprecedented finding of dozens of decapitated bodies buried inside a centrally located structure. In addition to the heads, several cervical bones are also absent, and the uppermost cervical vertebrae that remain often exhibit unmistakable cut marks. Victims of decapitation represent all ages and both sexes, some of whom had their wrists and ankles tied. Many of the victims exhibit parry fractures, which indicate a violent, face-to-face confrontation. The presence in Acari of several sites with constructed defensive systems (and with buffer zones between them), in conjunction with the evidence of decapitation, strongly indicate that outright violence occurred in Acari and that human decapitation likely was a direct outcome of that conflict.

AB  - Intensification of human sprawl in buffer zones of globally important African wilderness areas is of worldwide concern. The paper identifies two major conflicting (yet potentially reconcilable) pathways of rural sprawl in African wilderness buffer regions, described as the subsistence pathway and the wildlife-tourism pathway. Containment of rural sprawl near important ecological reserves requires addressing both pathways and their underlying conflicts. Reconciliation of subsistence sprawl with wildlife-conservation based tourism may occur through adequate compensation for community subsistence resource losses by the creation of sufficient alternatives to local communities that may reduce the need to rely on subsistence resources.

AB  - Streams, as low-lying points in the landscape, are strongly influenced by the stormwaters, pollutants, and warming that characterize catchment urbanization. River restoration projects are an increasingly popular method for mitigating urban insults. Despite the growing frequency and high expense of urban stream restoration projects, very few projects have been evaluated to determine whether they can successfully enhance habitat structure or support the stream biota characteristic of reference sites. We compared the physical and biological structure of four urban degraded, four urban restored, and four forested streams in the Piedmont region of North Carolina to quantify the ability of reachscale stream restoration to restore physical and biological structure to urban streams and to examine the assumption that providing habitat is sufficient for biological recovery. To be successful at mitigating urban impacts, the habitat structure and biological communities found in restored streams should be more similar to forested reference sites than to their urban degraded counterparts. For every measured reach-and patch-scale attribute, we found that restored streams were indistinguishable from their degraded urban stream counterparts. Forested streams were shallower, had greater habitat complexity and median sediment size, and contained less-tolerant communities with higher sensitive taxa richness than streams in either urban category. Because heavy machinery is used to regrade and reconfigure restored channels, restored streams had less canopy cover than either forested or urban streams. Channel habitat complexity and watershed impervious surface cover (ISC) were the best predictors of sensitive taxa richness and biotic index at the reach and catchment scale, respectively. Macroinvertebrate communities in restored channels were compositionally similar to the communities in urban degraded channels, and both were dissimilar to communities in forested streams. The macroinvertebrate communities of both restored and urban degraded streams were correlated with environmental variables characteristic of degraded urban systems. Our study suggests that reach-scale restoration is not successfully mitigating for the factors causing physical and biological degradation.

He suggests that the shape and character of the unoccupied region relates to the distribution and density of Virginia Deer populations which became a contested resource. This paper attempts to statistically test the possibility that an unoccupied buffer zone did exist in Minnesota during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods from about A. D. 1200 to A. D. 1800, and that site distributions for this period seem to substantiate the existence of such a zone.

AB  - Watershed analyses of nutrient removal in riparian buffers have been limited by the geographic methods used to map buffers and by the statistical models used to test and quantify buffer effects on stream nutrient levels. We combined geographic methods that account for buffer prevalence along flow paths connecting croplands to streams with improved statistical models to test for buffer effects on stream nitrate concentrations from 321 tributary watersheds to the Chesapeake Bay, USA. We developed statistical models that predict stream nitrate concentration from watershed land cover and physiographic province. We used information theoretic methods (AICc) to compare models with and without buffer terms, and we demonstrate that models accounting for riparian buffers better explain stream nitrate concentrations than models using only land cover proportions. We analyzed the buffer model parameters to quantify differences within and among physiographic provinces in the potentials for nitrate loss from croplands and nitrate removal in buffers. On average, buffers in Coastal Plain study watersheds had a higher relative nitrate removal potential (95% of the inputs from cropland) than Piedmont buffers (35% of inputs). Buffers in Appalachian Mountain study watersheds were intermediate (retaining 39% of cropland inputs), but that percentage was uncertain. The absolute potential to reduce nitrate concentration was highest in the Piedmont study watersheds because of higher nitrate inputs from cropland. Model predictions for the study watersheds provided estimates of nitrate removals achieved with the existing cropland and buffer distributions. Compared to expected nitrate concentrations if buffers were removed, current buffers reduced average nitrate concentrations by 0.73 mg N/L (50% of their inputs from cropland) in the Coastal Plain study watersheds, 0.40 mg N/L (11%) in the Piedmont, and 0.08 mg N/L (5%) in the Appalachian Mountains. Restoration to close all buffer gaps downhill from croplands would further reduce nitrate concentrations by 0.66 mg N/L, 0.83 mg N/L, and 0.51 mg N/L, respectively, in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Mountain study watersheds. Aggregate nitrate removal by riparian buffers was less than suggested by many studies of field-to-stream transects, but buffer nitrate removal is significant, and restoration could achieve substantial additional removal.

AB  - For landscapes with riparian buffers, we develop and analyze models predicting landscape discharge based on material release by an uphill source area, the spatial distribution of riparian buffer along a stream, and retention within the buffer. We model the buffer as a grid of cells, and each cell transmits a fixed fraction of the materials it receives. We consider the effects of variation in buffer width and buffer continuity, quantify the relative contributions of source elimination and buffer retention to total discharge reduction, and develop statistical relationships to simplify and generalize the models. Width variability reduces total buffer retention, increases the width needed to meet a management goal, and changes the importance of buffer retention relative to source elimination. Variable-width buffers are less efficient than uniform-width buffers because transport through areas of below-average buffer width (particularly gaps) dominates landscape discharge, especially for narrow buffers of highly retentive cells. Uniform-width models overestimate retention, so width variability should be considered when testing for buffer effects or designing buffers for water quality management. Adding riparian buffer to a landscape can decrease material discharge by increasing buffer retention and by eliminating source areas. Source elimination is more important in unretentive or wide buffers, while buffer retention dominates in narrow, retentive buffers. We summarize model results with simpler statistical relationships. For unretentive buffers, average width is the best predictor of landscape discharge, while the frequency of gaps was best for narrow, retentive buffers. Together, both predictors explain >90% of the variance in average landscape transmission for any value of buffer retentiveness. We relate our results to ecological theory, landscape-scale buffer effects, buffer management, and water quality models. We recommend more empirical studies of buffer width variability and its effects on material discharge. Landscape models should represent width variability and the nonlinear interactions between buffers and source areas.

AB  - Throughout most of the North American boreal forest, riparian buffer strips are left during clearcutting. Although this practice is considered a means to reduce adverse effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial fauna, little research has been conducted to quantify the extent to which buffer strips are used by wildlife. We compared breeding bird assemblages (grouped into 5 habitat guilds) in undisturbed shoreline habitats with those in 20-50-m-wide riparian buffer strips in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forests on insular Newfoundland, Canada. Total avian abundance was higher along buffer strips than undisturbed shorelines because of a greater abundance of ubiquitous species and species associated with clearcut edge habitats. Abundances of forest generalist, interior forest, and riparian species were similar between buffers and controls. Riparian buffer strips provided habitat for a diverse avian assemblage and maintained many riparian and woodland species in areas of intensive clearcutting. Counts of riparian species did not increase in wider buffers, likely due to their association with habitats adjacent to water, which do not increase in proportion to strip width. Total numbers of interior forest birds, many species of which may be declining in northeastern North America, may increase in wider buffers, but these species were rare even in the widest strips sampled (40-50 m) when compared to local interior forest habitat. Furthermore, 3 of 6 species in the interior forest guild were not observed in any buffer strip. While riparian conservation is essential, separate but complementary conservation strategies clearly are required to protect riparian and interior forest species.

AB  - Hydrochemical changes caused by slash-and-burn agricultural practices in a small upland catchment in the central Amazon were measured. Solute concentrations were analyzed in wet deposition, overland flow, shallow throughflow, groundwater and bank seepage in a forested plot (about 5 ha) and an adjacent plot (about 2 ha) which had been deforested in July 1989 and planted to manioc, and in stream water in partially deforested and forested catchments. Measurements were made from November 1988 to June 1990. The effects of slash-and-burn agricultural practices observed in the experimental plot included increased overland flow, erosion, and large losses of solutes from the rooted zone. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and Mn in throughflow of the experimental plot were higher than those of the control plot by more than a factor of 10. Extensive leaching occurred after cutting and burning, but solute transfers were diminished along pathway stages of throughflow to groundwater, and particularly within the riparian zone of the catchment. High concentrations of N and P in overland flow indicate the importance of using forested riparian buffers to mitigate solute inputs to receiving waters in tropical catchments.

AB  - With human populations increasing worldwide, habitat destruction and degradation are among the greatest threats facing wildlife. To minimize the impacts of development on aquatic habitats, numerous conservation measures have been implemented, including the use of riparian buffer zones along streams and rivers. We examined the effectiveness of current buffer-zone systems for management of small watersheds in conserving stream-dwelling salamander populations in 10 small streams (draining <40.5 ha) in the western Piedmont of North Carolina. We captured salamanders by means of funnel traps and systematic dipnetting and used a geographic information system to calculate the percentage of disturbed habitat within the watershed of each stream and within 10.7-, 30.5-, and 61.0-m buffer zones around each stream, upstream from our sampling locations. Although the relative abundance of salamanders was strongly inversely proportional to the percentage of disturbed habitat in the entire watersheds (R2 = 0.71 for Desmognathus fuscus and 0.48 for Eurycea cirrigera), we found little to no correlation between the relative abundance of salamanders and the percentage of disturbed habitat present within buffer zones (R2 = 0.06-0.27 for D. fuscus and 0.01-0.07 for E. cirrigera). Thus, conservation efforts aimed at preserving salamander populations in headwater streams must consider land use throughout entire watersheds, rather than just preserving small riparian buffer zones.

AB  - Border effects were demonstrated for injury by the sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghiella (Coquillet). Distinct and rather limited distance effects on yeild loss were observed within 30 m of an adjoining field which had produced many midges. This suggests that border treatments with an effective insecticide might be used to advantage and that more central parts of a field could receive less insecticide.

The beds are designed to catch surface runoff, leachate, and subsurface lateral flow. Switchgrass was established on beds filled with Cullen clay loam or Emporia sandy loam. Switchgrass established on Cullen clay loam beds reduced surface runoff by 60% and by 11% in sandy loam containing switchgrass compared to respective bare soils. Infiltration was 64, 26, 17, and 8% for clay loam with switchgrass, clay loam without switchgrass, sandy loam with switchgrass, and sandy loam without switchgrass, respectively.

AB  - 1. Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to intensification of agricultural management practices, including changes in cutting, fertilizer, grazing and drainage regimes. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that would have application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of grassland biodiversity, the beetles. 2. In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England, 10-m wide field margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing sward architectural complexity. This was achieved through combinations of inorganic (NPK) fertilizer, cattle grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to species level from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and their assemblage structure was related to margin management, floral assemblages and sward architecture. 3. Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin management treatment and its interaction with year. Correlations with sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds were found in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer. 4. The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments, sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses. The most extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories from the control treatment. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides management options suitable for use within agri-environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with intensively managed lowland grasslands. Field margins receiving either no management or a single July silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness of beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may also be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while maintaining grazing and silage cutting systems.

AB  - 1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.

One of the villages retains a mixed population and sometimes serves to funnel workers and goods from the Turkish-occupied north to the Greek market in the south.

AB  - Algal carbon has been increasingly recognized as the primary carbon source supporting large-river food webs; however, many of the studies that support this contention have focused on lotic main channels during low-flow periods. The flow variability and habitat-heterogeneity characteristic of these systems has the potential to significantly influence food web structure and must be integrated into models of large-river webs. We used stable-isotope analysis and IsoSource software to model terrestrial and algal sources of organic carbon supporting consumer taxa in the main channel and oxbow lakes of the Brazos River, Texas, USA, during a period of frequent hydrologic connectivity between these habitat types. Standardized sampling was conducted monthly to collect production sources and consumer species used in isotopic analysis. Predictability of hydrologic connections between habitat types was based on the previous 30 years of flow data. IsoSource mixing models identified terrestrial C&#x2083; macrophytes (riparian origin) as the primary carbon source supporting virtually all consumers in the main channel and most consumers in oxbow lakes. Small-bodied consumers (<100 mm) in oxbow lakes assimilated large fractions of algal carbon whereas this pattern was not apparent in the main channel. Estimates of detritivore trophic positions based on &#x3b4;&#x2071;&#x2075;N values indicated that terrestrial material was likely assimilated via invertebrates rather than directly from detritus. High flows in the river channel influenced algal standing stock, and differences in the importance of terrestrial and algal production sources among consumers in channel vs. oxbow habitats were associated with patterns of flooding. The importance of terrestrial material contradicts the findings of recent studies of large-river food webs that have emphasized the importance of algal carbon and indicates that there can be significant spatial, temporal, and taxonomic variation in carbon sources supporting consumers in large rivers.

AB  - The diversity of carabid assemblages at newly established field margins was compared to the diversity in surrounding fields and woodland habitats at Dongbeiwang village, Beijing. Carabids were sampled using 6 pitfalls per plot at a total of 12 plots in the year 2000. Although sampled only a year after their establishment, field margins harbored the most abundant and diverse carabids assemblages of all sites. More than a quarter of carabid species encountered were furthermore restricted to catches from field margins. Also woodland and fields under rotational wheat/maize cultivation harbored some unique species. Therefore, a short term establishment of field margins is effective in enhancing diversity and abundance of carabids, an important predator group in the agricultural landscape, while only the preservation of a heterogeneous landscape will enable the conservation of the overall species diversity.

AB  - We explore the history, structure and function, and management of vegetated field margins, particularly hedgerows, in Mexico since the pre-Hispanic period. We then focus on the current agricultural landscape in El Baj&#xed;o, central Mexico, describing in detail the abundance, composition, and management of existing hedgerows. These vegetated field margins can be traced to the pre-Hispanic period, especially in central Mexico, where Indians planted hedgerows, living fences, and terraces, mainly to prevent erosion. After the Spanish Conquest, some of these structures disappeared, but in many cases, new plant species were incorporated into the remaining field boundaries. Today, vegetated field boundaries are adjacent to crop fields and, in some places, they form networks similar to those seen in Europe. Farmers actively manage hedgerows for a variety of useful products and in so doing provide habitat and dispersal routes for native plants and animals.
