AB  - We studied two similar riparian sites in southern New England and examined ground water nitrate (NO(3-)-N) removal in the subsurface of mowed (i.e., herbaceous) vs. forested (i.e., woody) vegetation. Each site consisted of poorly drained, fine to medium sands and contained adjacent areas of mowed and forested vegetation. We dosed mesocosms with bromide and 15N labeled NO(3-)-N amended ground water to simulate the shallow ground water NO(3-)-N dynamics of riparian buffer zones. Mesocosms were composed of undisturbed, horizontal soil cores (40 cm long, 15 cm diam.) extracted from seasonally saturated subsoil. We observed substantial ground water NO(3-)-N removal and denitrification at all locations. Ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates were significantly correlated with carbon-enriched patches of organic matter. This correlation supports previous work that patches function as hotspots of microbial activity in the subsoil. Within each site, we found no significant difference in ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates in the subsoil of forested and mowed areas and we noted tree roots throughout the subsoil of the mowed areas. We found that ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates differed significantly between similar sites. We caution against ascribing specific ground water NO(3-)-N removal rates to different riparian aboveground vegetation types without recognizing the importance of site differences, e.g., water table dynamics, land use legacy and adjacent vegetation. Riparian zones composed of a mix of forested and mowed vegetation, common in agroforestry and suburban land uses, may remove substantial amounts of ground water NO(3-)-N.

AB  - Several studies have pointed to the potential benefits of riparian vegetation as buffer zones for agricultural and industrial pollutants harmful to aquatic ecosystems. However, other studies have called into question its use as an ecological filter, questioning the widths and conditions for which they are effective as a filter. In this work, we have investigated the buffering capacity of the riparian one to retain pesticides in the water-saturated zone, on 27 sites composed by riparian buffer zones with different vegetation structure (woody, shrubs, or grass vegetation) and width (12, 36, and 60 m). Five pesticides were analyzed. The effectiveness of the filtering was largely influenced by the width and vegetation type of the buffer zone. In general, decreasing pesticide removal followed in this order wood > shrubs > grass. The 60 m woody buffer zone was the most effective in the removal of all the pesticides. Only atrazine was detected in this case (0.3 μg L⁻¹). Furthermore, a linear correlation (R ² > 0.97) was observed in their removal for all compounds and buffer zones studied. Thus, preserving the woody vegetation in the riparian zone is important for watershed management and groundwater quality in the no-tillage system in temperate climate.

AB  - The factors controlling NO3 removal in riparian buffer systems are poorly understood. We measured denitrification rates for two Coastal Plain, forested riparian zone soils: Kinston fine loamy sand (fine-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic Typic Fluvaquent) and Alapaha loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Plinthic Paleaquult). Kinston soils are more poorly drained and have higher organic matter than Alapaha soils. Surface soil and shallow aquifer samples were treated with solutions that contained chloramphenicol with either distilled water, NO3-N, glucose-C, or NO3, plus glucose. Denitrification potentials (N2O production in the presence of acetylene) were significantly higher in Kinston soil for both depths. Surface samples from both soils showed significant responses to NO3 additions but no response to C additions without NO3. Subsurface samples, taken from the top of the aquifer, showed no significant response to either NO3 or C treatments for either soil. Both soils showed a high degree of stratification within the top 10 cm, with 88 and 68% of denitrification potential in the top 2 cm for Alapaha and Kinston soils, respectively. Denitrification rates in cores were much lower than in slurries but rates in cores with NO3 or NO3-plus-glucose additions were significantly higher than unamended or C-amended cores for the Kinston soil. Although both soils respond to NO3 additions, Kinston soils are better able to reduce incoming NO3. These results indicate that denitrification in the shallow aquifer is a more important removal mechanism at the Kinston site than at the Alapaha site.

AB  - Thinning of 30- to 70-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) stands is a common silvicultural activity on federal forest lands of the Pacific Northwest, United States. Empirical relationships among riparian functions, silvicultural treatments, and different riparian buffer widths are not well documented for small headwater streams. We investigated buffer width and density management effects on riparian microclimates of headwater streams in western Oregon. Spatial variations in stand density, canopy cover, and microclimate were measured along transects extending from stream center upslope into thinned stands, patch openings, or unthinned stands, with riparian buffers ranging from <5 m up to 150 m width. For treated stands, summer mean daily air and soil temperature maxima increased, and mean daily humidity minima decreased with distance from stream. Microclimate gradients were strongest within 10 m of stream center, a distinct area of stream influence within broader riparian areas. Thinning resulted in subtle changes in microclimate as mean air temperature maxima were 1 to 4 degrees C higher than in unthinned stands. With buffers 15 m or greater width, daily maximum air temperature above stream center was less than 1 degrees C greater, and daily minimum relative humidity was less than 5% lower than for unthinned stands. In contrast, air temperatures were significantly warmer within patch openings (+6 to +9 degrees C), and within buffers adjacent to patch openings (+3 degrees C) than within unthinned stands. Buffers of widths defined by the transition from riparian to upland vegetation or topographic slope breaks appear sufficient to mitigate the impacts of upslope thinning on the microclimate above headwater streams.

AB  - The combined effectiveness of thinning and riparian buffers for increasing structural complexity while maintaining riparian function in second-growth forests is not well documented. We surveyed down wood and vegetation cover along transects from stream center, through buffers ranging from <5 to 150 m width into thinned stands, patch openings, or unthinned stands of 40- to 65-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests in western Oregon, USA. Small-wood cover became more homogeneous among stream reaches within 5 years following thinning, primarily due to decreases for reaches having the greatest pretreatment abundance. Mean shrub cover converged, predominantly because of decreases in patch openings. Herbaceous cover increased, particularly in patch openings. Relative to unthinned stands, herbaceous cover was similar in wide buffers and increased in the narrowest buffers and in narrow buffers adjacent to patch openings. Moss cover tended to increase in thinned areas and decrease in patch openings. Both conventional point-null hypothesis tests and inequivalence tests suggested that wood and vegetation responses within buffers of ≥15 m width were insensitive to the treatments. However, inherently conservative equivalence tests infrequently inferred similarity between thinned stands or buffers and untreated stands. Difficulties defining ecologically important effect size can limit the inferential utility of equivalence–inequivalance testing.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution, which contributes to contamination of surface waters, is difficult to control. Some pollutants, particularly nitrate (NO₃⁻), are predominantly transmitted through ground water. Riparian buffer zones have the potential to remove contaminants from ground water and reduce the amount of NO₃⁻ that enters surface water. This is a justification for setting aside vegetated buffer strips along waterways. Many riparian zone hydrologic models assume uniform ground-water flow through organic-rich soil under reducing conditions, leading to effective removal of ground-water NO₃⁻ prior to discharge into a stream. However, in a small first-order stream in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain, base-flow generation was highly variable (spatially and temporally). Average base-flow NO₃⁻ loads were greater in winter than summer, and higher during a wetter year than in dryer years. Specific sections of the stream consistently received greater amounts of high NO₃⁻ ground water than others. Areas within the riparian zone responsible for most of the NO₃⁻ exported from the watershed are termed "critical areas." Over this 5-year study, most of the NO₃⁻ exported during base flow originated from a critical area comprising less than 10% of the total riparian zone land area. Allocation of resources to address and improve mitigation function in critical areas should be a priority for continued riparian zone research.

AB  - Riparian buffer strips are considered to provide natural remediation for groundwater contaminants, but this function is partly based on a relatively simple model of riparian zone hydrology; specifically, horizontal matrix flow through the shallow subsurface. Deviation from horizontal flow leads to asymmetrical groundwater emergence onto the surface and greater propensity for contaminant delivery to the stream. The study site, at the USDA-Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, is in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain of Maryland. The site contains a small first-order stream that is instrumented with five stations for monitoring stream flow and chemistry, and 170 nested piezometers (mostly in transects) for evaluating groundwater hydrology and geochemistry. Subsurface microstratigraphy and macroporosity are largely responsible for observed spatial and temporal variations in groundwater contributions to the stream. The portion of the stream that shows the highest rate of flow increase per stream length contains discrete zones of enhanced groundwater discharge (upwelling) to the surface, which supply most of the additional stream flow. These upwelling zones display high (positive) vertical hydraulic heads, which relate to the amount of groundwater discharged from those points. One particular area of intense groundwater upwelling supplies approximately 4% of the total stream outflow, yet comprises only 0.006% of the riparian zone. The upwelling zones also supply most of the NO3(-) to the surface. Zones of focused groundwater exfiltration that sustain stream baseflow do not correspond with erosional features, and have a great impact on stream flow characteristics and NO3(-) behavior. Few studies to date have elucidated and quantified contributions from specific surface features (e.g. upwelling zones, discharging macropores). More emphasis and research needs to be directed to the importance of focused groundwater exfiltration points for stream flow generation and NO3(-) transport, with the goal of devising more effective management regulations for preserving and enhancing riparian zone mitigation function.

AB  - Mediterranean rivers in the Iberian Peninsula are being increasingly affected by human activities, which threaten their ecological status. A clear picture of how do these multiple stressors affect river ecosystem functioning is still lacking. We addressed this question by measuring a key ecosystem process, namely breakdown of organic matter, at 66 sites distributed across Mediterranean Spain. We performed breakdown experiments by measuring the mass lost by wood sticks for 54 to 106days. Additionally, we gathered data on physico-chemical, biological and geomorphological characteristics of study sites. Study sites spanned a broad range of environmental characteristics and breakdown rates varied fiftyfold across sites. No clear geographic patterns were found between or within basins. 90th quantile regressions performed to link breakdown rates with environmental characteristics included the following 7 variables in the model, in decreasing order of importance: altitude, water content in phosphorus, catchment area, toxicity, invertebrate-based biotic index, riparian buffer width, and diatom-based quality index. Breakdown rate was systematically low in high-altitude rivers with few human impacts, but showed a high variability in areas affected by human activity. This increase in variability is the result of the influence of multiple stressors acting simultaneously, as some of these can promote whereas others slow down the breakdown of organic matter. Therefore, stick breakdown gives information on the intensity of a key ecosystem process, which would otherwise be very difficult to predict based on environmental variables.

AB  - Despite widespread adoption of conservation practices by farmers in the Cannonsville watershed, part of the New York City water supply system, there is considerable resistance to riparian buffer practices of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Traditional approaches to promoting CREP adoption, based on the adoption-diffusion model, were not effective in promoting CREP. We surveyed farmers in the Cannonsville watershed to evaluate factors affecting CREP adoption. Many variables commonly tied to practice adoption, including farm structure and farmer sociodemographic traits, were poorly correlated with the attitudes of Cannonsville farmers toward CREP. Attitudes toward land costs and farmer resentment toward New York City's control of land and conservation policy were, however, strong predictors of CREP adoption. This suggests that as regional watershed collaborations become more active in managing private landowner conservation behaviors, resentment factors may inhibit adoption of the encouraged practices. Findings provide insight into mechanisms to improve upstream-downstream partnerships and the potential to balance clean water resources with local agricultural production priorities.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay watershed of the northeastern U.S. has experienced extensive transition from agricultural to residential land uses. However, riparian buffer implementation research has generally focused on agricultural land uses and participation in agricultural conservation programs. Our research examines landowner willingness to implement riparian buffers in the Spring Creek watershed of central Pennsylvania, a sub-watershed of the Chesapeake Bay basin, which has also undergone population growth and land use transition. We conducted a mail survey of riparian residential, small agricultural, and agricultural landowners (n=175) to assess attitudes toward buffer implementation. Our results indicated that residential riparian respondents were 94% less willing than agricultural riparian respondents to implement a buffer on their property, net of other factors. Neighborhood friendships positively predicted willingness to implement buffers and also increased implementation willingness under certain incentive scenarios. Our findings indicate that landowners will become more willing to implement riparian buffers if they believe these buffers will have positive outcomes. Knowledge of Chesapeake Bay water quality, a central cause for riparian conservation programs, did not predict implementation willingness. As landscapes continue to transition toward residential uses, it is imperative that conservation programs adapt buffer design and program incentives to meet riparian residential landowner normative and aesthetic preferences.

AB  - Many agricultural landscapes are rapidly transitioning to more heterogeneous land uses with diverse types of landowners. While previous research has focused on conservation practice adoption among agricultural landowners, we use an efficacy theory framework to contrast riparian management behaviors across full-time farmers, part-time farmers, and residential landowners. We conducted semistructured interviews of landowners and conservation organization representatives within an urbanizing watershed in central Pennsylvania. Interviews focused on riparian buffers, perceived buffer outcomes, and urbanization throughout the region. Our findings indicate that structural changes to the landscape brought forth by urbanization diminish landowners’ self-efficacy via reduced capacity to implement buffers on small, residential parcels. Additionally, landowners’ outcome expectations are hampered through nearby, urban causes of perceived riparian and water quality degradation. Urbanization may reduce efficacy across the landscape, challenging riparian buffer implementation. We discuss organizations’ roles in landowners’ efficacy and offer pathways for organizational adaptation to residential growth.

AB  - Large areas of upland blanket peat were afforested in the UK and Ireland before the importance of the riparian buffer areas was realized. These forests are now reaching harvestable age. In order to reduce the possible negative impact of harvesting activities on receiving water bodies, the creation of buffer areas along receiving water courses prior to the clear-felling of the main plantation has been proposed. In this study, laboratory flumes were used to assess the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) retention efficiency of the vegetated and non-vegetated blanket peatland buffer areas under different hydraulic loadings. In addition, a mini-buffer approach is proposed and tested with flumes. The idea with mini-buffers is to keep P on site and reduce P transportation from harvest residues. In the grassed flumes, the DRP removal efficiencies gradually decreased from 80% to 40% and 30% to 18% when the hydraulic loadings increased from 49 to 123mmh⁻¹ and 256 to 444mmh⁻¹, respectively. In the non-grassed flumes, the DRP removal was about the same as for the grassed flumes when the hydraulic loading was 49mmh⁻¹ but was significantly less when the hydraulic loadings increased to 123, 256 and 444mmh⁻¹. The mini-buffer method could retain 88–95% (with seeded grasses) and 54–62% (without seeded grasses) of added DRP under different inflow DRP concentrations (between 0.5 and 3mgDRPL⁻¹). After ending the overland flow experiment, the water extractable phosphorus (WEP) and pore water P concentrations in the non-grassed flumes were significantly higher than the grassed flumes, indicating a higher risk of subsequent P release from non-grassed buffer areas after ending of P-rich overland flow. Our results indicated that the overall P retention capacity of the normal buffer areas in blanket peat catchments is low due to frequent occurrence of high flow events that significantly reduce buffer P retention efficiency. In contrast, the mini-buffer method could be a feasible means of increasing onsite P retention. This study is of particular interest currently as large areas of upland blanket peat forests without buffer areas in the UK and Ireland are being harvested or scheduled to be harvested in the near future.

AB  - 1. Species richness and assemblage patterns of organisms are dictated by numerous factors, probably operating at multiple scales. Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are an endangered, speciose faunal group, making them an interesting model system to study the influence of landscape features on organisms. In addition, landscape features that influence species distributions and the scale at which the factors have the greatest impact are important issues that need to be answered to conserve freshwater mussels. 2. In this study, we quantified freshwater mussel communities at 16 sites along three mid‐sized rivers in the south‐central United States. We addressed the following questions: (i) Are there predictable longitudinal changes in mussel community composition? (ii) What landscape variables best explain shifts in community composition? and (iii) At what scale do landscape variables best predict mussel community composition? 3. After controlling for the influence of longitudinal position along the stream, we compared mussel distributions to a suite of hypothesised explanatory landscape variables across multiple scales – catchment scale (entire drainage area), buffer scale (100‐m riparian buffer of the entire catchment) and reach scale (100‐m riparian buffer extending 1 km upstream from the sampling site). 4. We found a significant and consistent longitudinal shift in dominant mussel species across all three rivers, with community composition strongly related to distance from the headwaters, which is highly correlated with stream size. After accounting for stream size, variables at the buffer scale were the best predictors of mussel community composition. After accounting for catchment position, mean channel slope was the best explanatory variable of community composition and appeared in all top candidate models at the catchment and buffer scales. Coverage of wetland and urban area were also correlated with community composition at the catchment and buffer scales. 5. Our results suggest that landscape‐scale habitat factors influence mussel community composition. Landscape features at the buffer scale performed best at determining community composition after accounting for position in the catchment; thus, further protection of riparian buffers will help to conserve mussel communities.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are interfaces between aquatic and terrestrial environments recognized for their nutrient interception potential in agricultural landscapes. Stream network maps from a broad range of map resolutions have been employed in watershed studies of riparian areas. However, map resolution may affect important attributes of riparian buffers, such as the connectivity between source lands and small stream channels missing in coarse resolution maps. We sought to understand the influence of changing stream map resolution on measures of the river network, near-stream land cover, and riparian metrics. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate the influence of stream map resolution on measures of the stream network, the character and extent of near-stream zones, and riparian metrics; (2) to compare patterns of variation among different physiographic provinces; and (3) to explore how predictions of nutrient retention potential might be affected by the resolution of a stream map. We found that using fine resolution stream maps significantly increased our estimates of stream order, drainage density, and the proportion of watershed area occurring near a stream. Increasing stream map resolution reduced the mean distance to source areas as well as mean buffer width and increased the frequency of buffer gaps. Measures of percent land cover within 100 m of streams were less sensitive to stream map resolution. Overall, increasing stream map resolution led to reduced estimates of nutrient retention potential in riparian buffers. In some watersheds, switching from a coarse resolution to a fine resolution stream map completely changed our perception of a stream network from well buffered to largely unbuffered. Because previous, broad-scale analyses of riparian buffers used coarse-resolution stream maps, those studies may have overestimated landscape-level buffer prevalence and effectiveness. We present a case study of three watersheds to demonstrate that interactions among stream map resolution and land cover patterns make a dramatic difference in the perceived ability of riparian buffers to ameliorate effects of agricultural activities across whole watersheds. Moreover, stream map resolution affects inferences about whether retention occurs in streams or riparian zones.

AB  - Enteric microbial pathogens originating from agricultural practices pose a serious threat to surface water quality and human health. A two-phase study was conducted in southern Illinois that examined the ability of various riparian buffer species to attenuate fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow, while also assessing E. coli persistence in associated buffer soils. Plots established with giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.), Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and non-vegetated control buffers were subjected to artificial flooding with cattle (Bos taurus) manure-laden water. Mean bacteria concentrations in overland flow exiting all plots were significantly higher than concentrations found in the source slurry. To assess E. coli persistence in plots, overland flow was collected from a simulated rainfall event 4� days following slurry application, and from natural rainfall events 22, 46, 94, 97, and 111� days after the application. Overland flow exiting all plots (including non-vegetated controls) exhibited mean E. coli concentrations significantly higher than those found in the initial slurry applied. The observed concentrations may have been the result of overland flow characteristics and high levels of ambient fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) present with plots. The moist, shaded conditions created by plot vegetation may have produced prime habitat to harbor FIB. Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) may have been effective at attenuating FIB, however, performance may have been masked by the exceptionally high ambient FIB populations that were present in adjacent soils. The young age of the VBS (<1� year) may have also influenced their seemingly poor FIB attenuation. As the VBS age, increases in above and below ground vegetative material may act to increase VBS attenuation capabilities.

AB  - The present study was performed to characterise in-stream pesticide exposure within the Palatinate vineyard region in south-west Germany, evaluate the influence of buffer strip widths and identify mitigation measures for the relevant entry pathways. In-stream water and sediment samples that were taken at nine sampling sites of different buffer widths following intense rainfall, and edge-of-field runoff that were sampled in erosion rills were analysed regarding 28 active ingredients of pesticides including copper. In-stream samples contained a mix of 8±4 pesticide compounds, resulting in total pesticide concentrations of 1.4–8.9μgl⁻¹ for water and 16–670μgkg⁻¹dw for sediment. Following an exceptional rainfall event with a previous 34-day drought period, pesticide concentrations reached 7.0–83.4μgl⁻¹. Fungicides were the most important pesticides found and were significantly correlated with the pesticide application frequency and rate. The calculated toxicity values per sample (TUₘₐₓ) indicated that both organic pesticides and copper concentrations likely cause ecotoxicological effects in the field. The buffer strip width was of little importance for pesticide in-stream concentrations because pesticide entry occurred mainly via the field path network and erosion rills. Pesticide in-stream concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations detected in erosion rills (R²=0.56). As possible risk mitigation measures, we suggest the implementation of grassed field paths and vegetated ditches or wetlands.

AB  - The production-oriented agricultural system of Midwestern United States has caused environmental problems such as soil degradation and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of water. Riparian buffers have been shown to reduce the impacts of NPS pollutants on stream water quality through the enhancement of riparian zone soil quality. The objective of this study was to compare soil-water infiltration in a Coland soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Endoaquoll) under multi-species riparian buffer vegetation with that of cultivated fields and a grazed pasture. Eight infiltration measurements were made, in each of six treatments. Bulk density, antecedent soil moisture, and particle size were also examined. The average 60-min cumulative infiltration was five times greater under the buffers than under the cultivated field and pasture. Cumulative infiltration in the multi-species riparian buffer was in the order of silver maple > grass filter > switchgrass. Cumulative infiltration did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) among corn and soybean crop fields and the pasture. Soil bulk densities under the multi-species buffer vegetation were significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than in the crop fields and the pasture. Other measured parameters did not show consistent trends. Thus, when using infiltration as an index, the established multi-species buffer vegetation seemed to improve soil quality after six years.

AB  - In the small, agricultural, artificially drained Orgeval watershed δ15N values of leached nitrates and soil organic nitrogen were found to be significantly higher than the primary nitrogen (N) sources from which they are derived, namely, synthetic fertilizers, atmospheric deposition, and symbiotic or nonsymbiotic N2 fixation (all with δ15N close to zero). In vertical soil profiles, the δ15N of organic N increased with depth, reaching higher values (up to 8‰) particularly at stations that were frequently waterlogged as judged from ochre iron traces, such as downhill field sites or in riparian buffer strips. Nitrification, volatilization, and denitrification are the main fractionating processes able to modify the isotopic composition of soil N. Using a newly designed algorithm for calculating the equilibrium isotopic composition of all soil N species, resulting from the average annual balance of their transformations, we show that the observed trends can be explained by the action of denitrification. We suggest that the isotopic composition of soil organic N can be used as a semiquantitative indicator of the intensity of denitrification integrated over century-long periods.

AB  - Methods for simulating different landscape positions within the SWAT model are being examined. A three component system, consisting of the watershed divide, the hillslope, and the floodplain landscape positions, has been developed to address flow and transport across hydrologic response units prior to concentration in streams. The modified SWAT model is capable of simulating flow and transport from higher landscape positions to lower positions within a single river basin. The revision was developed to address variable source areas within watersheds and stream-side buffer systems which exist alongside many streams. The enhanced model will allow for more accurate simulation of natural transport processes within a hillslope. The revision was tested using data collected from a low-gradient watershed near Tifton, Georgia, USA which contains heavily vegetated riparian buffers. The modified model provided reasonable simulations of surface and subsurface flow across the landscape positions without calibration. The application demonstrates the applicability of the model to simulate filtering of surface runoff, enhanced infiltration, and water quality buffering typically associated with riparian buffer systems.

AB  - Accurate simulation of landscape processes in natural resource models requires spatial distribution of basin hydrology and transport processes. To better represent these processes, a landscape version of the SWAT model has been developed to simulate the runoff, run-on, and infiltration processes that typically occur in different parts of the landscape. The model addresses flow and transport across hydrologic response units prior to concentration in streams, and is capable of simulating flow and transport from higher landscape positions to lower positions. The SWAT landscape model was tested using data collected from a heavily vegetated riparian buffer system in the Atlantic Coastal Plain near Tifton, Georgia. Simulations of surface runoff, lateral subsurface runoff, and groundwater flow for an upland field, a grass buffer, and a sub-divided forested buffer floodplain were generated. Model results and field data indicate that surface runoff was dominant in the upland field, while groundwater flow was dominant in the grass buffer and the floodplain. While average annual surface runoff agreed satisfactorily with observations from the site, annual and monthly simulated values varied considerably from observed values. Simulated surface runoff tracked general trends in the observed data, but winter months and extreme events were overestimated while summer months were underestimated. Annual surface runoff predictions at the edge of the upland field varied from the observed data by 11% to 44%. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for annual estimates of surface runoff at the field edge was 0.83 for the three-year calibration period. The results demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the surface runoff and enhanced infiltration typically associated with riparian buffer systems. Additional revision of the model will likely be necessary to adequately represent redistribution of water between surface, lateral subsurface flow, and groundwater flow.

AB  - Matric potential was measured in a grass and forest riparian buffer system adjacent to a cropped field in the Georgia Coastal Plain. The soil in the adjacent cropped field is a Tifton loamy sand, containing an argillic subsurface horizon with plinthite at approximately 1 m which has been shown to restrict vertical infiltration and induce lateral flow. Two years of matric potential data and measurements of soil hydraulic characteristics were examined to evaluate and quantify unsaturated water flow in the riparian buffer. The lowest soil matric potential occurred at the grass/forest interface, and the greatest surface infiltration occurred within 10 m downslope of the same interface. The area of low matric potential was likely due to water uptake by trees. Water flowed laterally through the unsaturated soil into the riparian area from the upland field, apparently induced by low vertical conductivity in the subsurface and driven by the high water demand of the forest.

AB  - Water table gradients were measured and saturated flow rates estimated for a hillslope consisting of a tilled upland field and a downslope riparian forest buffer system located in the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain Tifton-Vidalia Uplands. Three years of water table measurements and estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity were used to evaluate and quantify saturated waterflow gradients, directions, and rates. Forest treatments consisting of clear cutting, thinning, and no cutting were examined. The gradient of the water table from the top of the landscape to the bottom varied from 0.9 to 0.2%, less than the 1.5% land slope. The direction of groundwater flow generally followed the land slope. However, during summer months the hydraulic gradient within the forested buffer reversed direction. Water table data indicate the riparian area was saturated from January through March. During this time, flow direction the shallow aquifer is from the top of the field to the stream bottom. During summer months, high rates of forest evapotranspiration created large water sinks in the shallow subsurface and large local hydraulic gradients. Examination of water table elevations indicates the seasonal water demand of the forest shifts the direction of shallow subsurface aquifer flow. During these periods flow direction within the riparian buffer was from the lowest landscape position to the riparian forest, reversed from winter months. Total subsurface flow within the hillslope was calculated as 35 mm yr-1, 3% of average annual precipitation. Average groundwater linear velocity was calculated as 1.4 mm h-1. Evapotranspiration loss was estimated as 67% of average annual precipitation.

AB  - Forested riparian buffer strips are recommended as an agricultural best management practice for protection of water quality and for wildlife habitat. Since the 1990s, federal and state conservation agencies in Virginia have been involved in establishment of riparian buffers under the auspices of programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Riparian buffers established by the CREP program are considered to be beneficial towards the protection of water quality. However, the benefit is based upon assumption that planted trees and shrubs survive and grow. Little evaluation has been done within the state to document the success of the establishment efforts. We evaluated 63 riparian planting sites located in the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces of Virginia. Overall, the riparian forests in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont were fully stocked due to a combination of planted and natural regeneration. Riparian forests in the Ridge and Valley region were inadequately stocked, and the region has problems with invasive, exotic species. Major recommendations for improving the success of future riparian restoration and establishment efforts are to (1) include the potential for natural regeneration when planning CREP plantings, (2) stop mechanized operations in the riparian buffers that reduce planted and natural regeneration (e.g., mowing and disking), (3) reduce herbivory (particularly cattle) within the riparian buffer, and (4) control invasive exotic species as necessary.

AB  - Vegetated riparian buffer strips have been established in Southern Quebec (Canada) in order to intercept nutrients such as nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) and protect water quality near agricultural fields. Buffer strips may also favour denitrification through a combination of high soil moisture, NO₃ ⁻ and carbon supply, which could lead to the production of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a greenhouse gas. Denitrification could be further amplified by the presence of earthworms, or by plant species that promote earthworm and bacterial activity in soils. Soils from four farms, comprising maize fields and adjacent buffer strips, were sampled in the fall of 2008. A total of six earthworm species were found, but average earthworm biomass did not differ between buffer strips and maize agroecoecosystems. Nitrate concentrations and net nitrification rates were higher in the maize fields than in the buffer strips; there was no difference in N₂O production in soils collected from the two sampling locations. Potential denitrification, measured by acetylene inhibition, varied by two orders of magnitude, depending on experimental conditions; when amended with H₂O or with H₂O+NO₃ ⁻, potential denitrification was higher (P<0.05) in soils from buffer strips than from maize fields. Potential denitrification was highest in soils amended with H₂O+glucose, or with H₂O+NO₃ ⁻+glucose. Using microcosms, we tested the effect of litter–soil mixtures on earthworm growth, and the effect of earthworm-litter–soil mixtures on potential denitrification. Based on four categories of chemical assays, litters of woody species (oak, apple, Rhododendron) were generally of lower nutritional quality than litter from agronomic species (alfalfa, switchgrass, corn stover). Alfalfa litter had the most positive effect, whereas apple litter had the most negative effect, on earthworm growth. Potential denitrification was 2–4 times higher in earthworm–litter–soil mixtures than in plain soil. Litter treatments that included corn stover had lower potential denitrification than those that included alfalfa or switchgrass, whereas litter treatments that included oak had lower potential denitrification than those that included apple or Rhododendron. Results suggest that potential N₂O emissions may be higher in riparian buffer strips than in adjacent maize fields, that N₂O emissions in buffer strips may be amplified by comminuting earthworms, and that plant litters that reduce earthworm growth may not be best at mitigating N₂O emissions.

AB  - 1. Clearcutting and wildfire are the two major edge‐creating disturbances in boreal forests. While clearcutting retains at least a 30 m buffer, wildfires burn close to streams killing most of the trees and potentially creating a different edge structure. Different edge structures are likely to support different plant assemblages. The riparian buffer and fire edge structures and their effects on plant assemblages are unknown, but they have implications for forest management that aims to harvest trees and conserve biodiversity by emulating natural disturbance. 2. We hypothesized that environmental filters created by post‐fire residual structures at the fire edge will support a different plant assemblage than the buffer edge. We further hypothesized that the fire edge with a weaker environmental filter because of post‐fire residual structures and proximity to streams will result in lower depth of edge effects (DEEs) and magnitude of edge effects (MEEs) than buffer edges. 3. We determined the structure of canopy trees, understorey cover and the near‐ground microclimate by sampling 576 (5 × 10 m) and 1820 (1 × 1 m) quadrats along 96 transects beside 24 streams near Thunder Bay, Canada. We determined DEEs and MEEs by comparing edge variables with reference forests. We used repeated measures/factorial anovas with Tukey’s post hoc tests to determine DEEs and manova for MEEs. 4. The average microclimatic DEEs extended 8 m into the buffer but only 2·5 m from the fire edge. Similarly, the DEEs for plant life‐forms extended 20 m from the buffer edge and 5 m from the fire edge. At the fire edge, the structural MEEs were significantly higher, but the microclimatic MEEs were lower than the buffer edge. We found no significant difference in the overall life‐form MEEs, but shrubs, shade‐tolerant herbs and grasses were increased at the buffer edge and decreased at the fire edge. 5. Synthesis and applications. We discovered that the ecological structure at buffer and fire edges in boreal forests creates different environmental filters supporting different plant assemblages. Lower structural and microclimatic DEEs and MEEs at the fire edge result from (i) edge location, (ii) intact shrub layer and (iii) disturbance‐resilient riparian vegetation. We suggest that replacing the conventional sharp edges of the riparian clear‐cut buffer with ‘feathered’ edges by selective harvesting of trees will create wider edges mimicking wildfire legacy and will help to emulate natural disturbance for conserving biodiversity.

AB  - Poultry-litter applications to pastures can result in relatively high soil phosphorus (P) levels, which in turn can contaminate runoff and degrade surface water quality. New management protocols for temperate grasslands are needed to reduce the risk of P transport to surface water. The effects of three land-use treatments on soil characteristics related to P runoff were investigated using small watersheds with 8% slope near Booneville, Arkansas, U.S. The land use treatments were (1) haying of bermudagrass overseeded with winter annual forage (ryegrass or rye), (2) rotationally grazed, and (3) rotationally grazed with 12-m-wide tree buffer on the downhill portion of the plot. Plots and trees were established in 2003. Annual spring application of poultry litter (5.6 Mg ha⁻¹) to the hayed or grazed portions of the plots was started in 2004. Grazing treatments were imposed shortly thereafter. By the summer of 2008 (4 years of treatments), soil concentrations of Bray 1–extractable P and soluble reactive P had increased significantly from approximately 40 and 4 mg P kg⁻¹ soil, respectively, to more than 200 and 30 mg P kg⁻¹ soil, respectively, in the areas of the plots receiving poultry litter. Soil bulk density in the portions of the plots being grazed had increased significantly also. The soil collected from the forested riparian buffer in 2008 had similar soil bulk densities and Bray 1–extractable P concentrations as the plots did in 2003 before treatments were imposed.

AB  - Riparian zones along forest streams in the western United States have been repeatedly shown to be floristically and climatically different from adjacent upland forest, and to be important contributors to forest biodiversity. Similar evidence for the presence or function of riparian zones is lacking for forests of the northeastern U.S. We conducted seasonal surveys of forest-floor temperature and soil moisture across 30-m riparian transects on first- to third-order streams in southern New England. We were unable to detect any effect of distance from the stream channel on either temperature or soil moisture. These preliminary results indicate the absence of a unique riparian forest-floor microclimate within 30m of low-order streams in southern New England. While this study failed to identify a distinctive riparian microclimatic zone, protection of a riparian buffer during forestry operations or other disturbance is essential for the protection of forest streams and their resources and the maintenance of forest biodiversity.

AB  - As understanding of the complex relations among environmental stressors and biological responses improves, a logical next step is predictive modeling of biological condition at unsampled sites. We developed a boosted regression tree (BRT) model of biological condition, as measured by a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (BIBI), for streams in urbanized Southern Coastal California. We also developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark for comparison with the BRT model. The BRT model explained 66% of the variance in B-IBI, identifying watershed population density and combined percentage agricultural and urban land cover in the riparian buffer as the most important predictors of B-IBI, but with watershed mean precipitation and watershed density of manmade channels also important. The MLR model explained 48% of the variance in B-IBI and included watershed population density and combined percentage agricultural and urban land cover in the riparian buffer. For a verification data set, the BRT model correctly classified 75% of impaired sites (B-IBI<40) and 78% of unimpaired sites (B-IBI≥40). For the same verification data set, the MLR model correctly classified 69% of impaired sites and 87% of unimpaired sites. The BRT model should not be used to predict B-IBI for specific sites; however, the model can be useful for general applications such as identifying and prioritizing regions for monitoring, remediation or preservation, stratifying new bioassessments according to anticipated biological condition, or assessing the potential for change in stream biological condition based on anticipated changes in population density and development in stream buffers.

AB  - In the European Union, mitigation measures to abate diffuse pollution from agricultural land are implemented under the direction of the EU Nitrates and Water Framework Directives. As these measures are implemented in national policies, a review process will look at the efficacy of the measures with a view to recommending further measures as necessary and following scientific and stakeholder consultation. Riparian buffer zones, beyond those zones used as mandatory set back distances for fertiliser and organic manure spreading, have been used as filters in some countries to attenuate nutrient rich runoff and may be proposed as supplementary measures elsewhere. Notwithstanding the ongoing research on the physio-chemical efficiency of riparian buffer zones, this study examined the willingness of farmers to adopt such features on agricultural land. The sample size was 247 farmers in 12 catchments (approximately 4–12km²) in the Republic of Ireland. The survey was based on a proposal to install a 10m deep riparian buffer zone on a five year scheme and the analysis was based on principal components analysis, contingent valuation methodology and a Generalised Tobit Interval Model. Results from this analysis indicated that famers’ willingness to supply a riparian buffer zone depended on a mix of economic, attitudinal and farm structural factors. A total of 53% of the sample indicated a negative preference for provision. Principle constraints to adoption include interference with production, nuisance effects and loss of production in small field systems. Of those willing to engage with supply, the mean willingness to accept based cost of provision for a 10m riparian buffer zone was estimated to be €1513ha⁻¹ per annum equivalent to €1.51 per linear metre of riparian area.

AB  - Riparian treatments, consisting of 3- to 4-m buffer strips, stream bank stabilization, and rock-lined stream crossings, were installed in two streams with livestock grazing to reduce sediment loading and stream bank erosion. Cedar Run and Slab Cabin Run, the treatment streams, and Spring Creek, an adjacent reference stream without riparian grazing, were monitored prior to (1991-1992) and 3-5 years after (2001-2003) riparian buffer installation to assess channel morphology, stream substrate composition, suspended sediments, and macroinvertebrate communities. Few changes were found in channel widths and depths, but channel-structuring flow events were rare in the drought period after restoration. Stream bank vegetation increased from 50% or less to 100% in nearly all formerly grazed riparian buffers. The proportion of fine sediments in stream substrates decreased in Cedar Run but not in Slab Cabin Run. After riparian treatments, suspended sediments during base flow and storm flow decreased 47-87% in both streams. Macroinvertebrate diversity did not improve after restoration in either treated stream. Relative to Spring Creek, macroinvertebrate densities increased in both treated streams by the end of the posttreatment sampling period. Despite drought conditions that may have altered physical and biological effects of riparian treatments, goals of the riparian restoration to minimize erosion and sedimentation were met. A relatively narrow grass buffer along 2.4 km of each stream was effective in improving water quality, stream substrates, and some biological metrics.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for determining optimal planting recommendations for bottomlands and riparian buffer strips within a geographic information system (GIS) framework. The specific objective of this study was the development of a decision support model to generate riparian tree-planting recommendations based on site characteristics. Unlike previous research, this study enhances the usefulness of conventional site evaluation guides by incorporating digital soil surveys and other spatial data at a level of detail and automation previously unavailable. Research was conducted in the Cypress Creek Quadrangle, southern Illinois, and planting recommendations were generated for eight bottomland hardwood species. Model results were consistent with accepted silvicultural recommendations. Species were consistently placed within sites most suitable for each individual's requirements, and as a result, model recommendations should produce riparian forests optimizing growth potential. By adopting this approach, more productive forest cover could be established while concurrently reducing costs associated with on-site evaluations.

AB  - The Feitsui reservoir is a major water supply source for more than five million people in Northern Taiwan. The reservoir water quality has been good, but is threatened by eutrophication due to excessive nutrient input and siltation due to sediment loads. Recently, the water authorities in Taiwan have made considerable efforts to devise strategies using watershed conservation practices for the protection of Feitsui reservoir water quality. The control of non-point source pollution (NPS) represents one of the major strategies and the use of best management practices (BMPs) is under careful consideration. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost of a full Feitsui watershed implementation of riparian buffer strips and other appropriate conservation practices. Based on the use of watershed simulation models and a statistical relationship between pollution reduction rate and the width and slope of a buffer strip, a methodology for the planning and design of riparian buffer strips was addressed. Data from field experiments were used to calibrate the coefficients of the regression equations. Several planning scenarios were evaluated by means of cost-benefit analysis coupled with net present value method. Data on local construction and maintenance costs for the selected design and location of buffer strips were used in the analysis. Based on several cost-benefit analyses, the scenario for installing buffer strips with 30 m width and 5% slope along both sides of tributary streams in the sub-watersheds with high nutrient (phosphorus) loadings was found to be most cost effective.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) does not fully simulate riparian buffers, but has a simple filter function that is responsive to filter strip width (FILTERW). The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate SWAT hydrology and water quality response to changes in watershed subdivision levels and different FILTERW configurations and (2) provide guidance for selecting appropriate watershed subdivision for model runs that include the riparian buffer feature through the FILTERW parameter. Watershed subdivision level is controlled by the critical source area (CSA) which defines the minimum drainage area required to form the origin of a stream. SWAT was calibrated on a 15.7 km2 subdrainage within the Little River Experimental Watershed, Georgia. The calibrated parameter set was applied to 32 watershed configurations consisting of four FILTERW representations for each of eight CSA levels. Streamflow predictions were stable regardless of watershed subdivision and FILTERW configuration. Predicted sediment and nutrient loads from upland areas decreased as CSA increased when spatial variations of riparian buffers are considered. Sediment and nutrient yield at the watershed outlet was responsive to different combinations of CSA and FILTERW depending on selected in-stream processes. CSA ranges which provide stable sediment and nutrient yields at the watershed outlet was suggested for avoiding significant modifications in selected parameter set.

AB  - Within the Southeastern (SE) Coastal Plain of the U.S., numerous freshwaters and estuaries experience eutrophication with significant nutrient contributions by agricultural non-point sources (NPS). Riparian buffers are often used to reduce agricultural NPS yet the effect of buffers in the watershed is difficult to quantify. Using corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) and model averaging, we compared flow-path riparian buffer models with land use/land cover (LULC) models in 24 watersheds from the SE Coastal Plain to determine the ability of riparian buffers to reduce or mitigate stream total nitrogen concentrations (TNC). Additional models considered the relative importance of headwaters and artificial agricultural drainage in the Coastal Plain. A buffer model which included cropland and non-buffered cropland best explained stream TNC (R ²� =� 0.75) and was five times more likely to be the correct model than the LULC model. The model average predicted that current buffers removed 52� % of nitrogen from the edge-of-field and 45� % of potential nitrogen from the average SE Coastal Plain watershed. On average, 26� % of stream nitrogen leaked through buffered cropland. Our study suggests that stream TNC could potentially be reduced by 34� % if buffers were adequately restored on all cropland. Such estimates provide realistic expectations of nitrogen removal via buffers to watershed managers as they attempt to meet water quality goals. In addition, model comparisons of AICc values indicated that non-headwater buffers may contribute little to stream TNC. Model comparisons also indicated that artificial drainage should be considered when accessing buffers and stream nitrogen.

AB  - Forty-six independent stream reaches in southeastern Pennsylvania were surveyed to assess the relationships between geomorphic and habitat variables and watershed total impervious area (TIA) and to test the ability of the impervious cover model (ICM) to predict the impervious category based on stream reach variables. Ten variables were analyzed using simple and multivariate statistical techniques including scatterplots, Spearman\'s Rank correlations, principal components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Graphical analysis suggested differences in the response to TIA between the stream reaches with less than 13 percent TIA and those with greater than 24 percent TIA. Spearman\'s Rank correlations showed significant relationships for large woody debris and sinuosity when analyzing the entire dataset and for depth diversity and the standard deviation of maximum pool depths when analyzing stream reaches with greater than 24 percent TIA. Classification into the ICM using DA was 49 percent accurate; however, the stream reaches did support the ICM in other ways. These results indicate that stream reach response to urbanization may not be consistent across geographical regions and that local conditions (specifically riparian buffer vegetation) may significantly affect channel response; and the ICM, used in the appropriate context, can aid in the management of stream reaches and watersheds.

AB  - One-half of a 35- by 250-m riparian buffer cropped in corn (Zea mays L.) was seeded with fine leaf fescue (Festuca spp.) and allowed to remain idle to determine water quality changes resulting from riparian buffer restoration. A corn control was also used in this paired watershed design located in Connecticut. Water, N, and P fluxes were determined for precipitation, overland flow, and ground water. Also, an N mass balance was calculated. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) increased as ground water flowed through the restored buffer. Nitrate N (NO3-N) concentrations declined significantly but most (52%) of the decrease occurred within a 2.5-m wetland adjacent to the stream. An N mass balance for the 2.5-m strip indicated that denitrification only accounted for 1% of the N losses and plant uptake was from 7 to 13% of the N losses annually. Ground water was the dominant source of N to the buffer and also the dominant loss. Restoration of the riparian buffer decreased (p < 0.05) overland flow concentrations of TKN by 70%, NO3-N by 83%, TP by 73%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 92% as compared with the control. Restoration reduced (p < 0.05) NO3-N concentrations in ground water by 35% as compared with the control. Underestimated denitrification and dilution by upwelling ground water in the wetland area adjacent to the stream were believed to be primarily responsible for the decreasing NO3-N concentrations observed.

AB  - 1.Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known.2.Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time.3.Post-treatment (2000-2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined.4.This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before-after control-intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Vegetated riparian buffers are critical for protecting aquatic and terrestrial processes and habitats in southern Appalachian ecosystems. In this case study, we examined the effect of riparian buffer width on stream water quality following upland forest management activities in four headwater catchments. Three riparian buffer widths were delineated prior to cutting; 0m (no-buffer), 10m, and 30m, and one reference site (REF). A two-age prescription timber harvest was conducted on all cut sites with a target residual basal area of approximately 4.0m²ha⁻¹. Harvesting occurred from October 2005 through February 2007. Stream sampling was conducted weekly from January 2004 through December 2008. Stream water chemistry, temperature, and total suspended solids (TSS) were used as metrics of water quality. Analyses were conducted on weekly grab samples. Pre-treatment concentrations of all solutes were similar to conditions found in other headwater streams at similar topographic positions around the region. The greatest responses to cutting occurred on the no-buffer site. Compared with pre-harvest levels on the no-buffer site, stream nitrate concentration ([NO₃–N]) increased 2-fold during both base and stormflow following harvest, and all base cations increased in concentration. [NO₃–N] on the no-buffer site showed steady decline with time following the initial post-harvest increase. The other sites did not show increases in [NO₃–N] and very small or no responses in other stream chemistry parameters. There was no TSS response at stormflow on any site, and during baseflow, TSS decreased on all but the no-buffer site. Stream water temperature increased during the summer on the no-buffer site. Although alternative land uses may have different requirements, these results suggest that for riparian buffer widths of 10m and wider, the forest harvest activities implemented in this study did not substantially impact stream water quality. Hence, 10m wide buffers in these ecosystems may provide effective protection with respect to stream water chemistry, TSS, and temperature.

AB  - The use of riparian buffer strips as a means of reducing diffuse pollution in European grassland systems is becoming more common and consequently there is a need for comprehensive research on the influence of buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity. Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer strips (>5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (<2 m wide) and adjacent fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were, however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.

AB  - It was hypothesized that the type and height of riparian vegetation would affect its ability to filter and retain inorganic nitrogen (nitrate-nitrogen (NO3(-)-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), and inorganic phosphorus (phosphate-phosphorus (PO4(-3)-P)). A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used to evaluate 2 montane riparian communities as filters for removing NO3(-)-N, NH4(+)-N, and PO4(-3)-P nutrients from sediment laden overland flow water. One riparian community was characterized by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) Beauv.), while the second community was dominated by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata Stokes) and water sedge (Carex aquatilus Wahl.). Three vegetation height treatments were evaluated: control (natural condition), moderate treatment (clipped to 10-cm height and clipped material removed), and heavy treatment (clipped to ground level, clipped material removed, and litter vacuumed up). A 10-m wide riparian buffer zone was an efficient filter as about 84% NO3(-)-N and 79% PO4(-3)-P was removed from the applied water and sediment. However, there were no consistent differences among specific vegetation height treatments or communities in the removal of N and P nutrients.

AB  - The thermal regimes in streambed substrates used by brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchell, for incubation of embryos were examined in reference and treatment (0- and 20-m riparian buffer strips) streams in a clear-cut harvested, northern temperate forest of western Newfoundland. In these streams, incubation habitats (redds) were primarily composed of downwelling surface waters with variable but minor mixing of upwelling groundwater. The resulting incubation temperatures were cold (<1 degrees C) and surface water temperatures were accurate predictors of redd temperatures. Both treatment streams displayed evidence of warming in the fall and spring of the 2 years beginning the year of initial harvesting. The increase was most pronounced in the stream without a riparian buffer strip. Clear-cut harvesting with and without a riparian buffer strip altered the thermal regime of surface water and the hyporheic zone in this northern temperate forest where, in addition to salmonid incubation, many biological processes take place. The potential for impacts on stream ecosystems is estimated to be high for the managed forests of this region. Future studies should strive to enhance our understanding of the hydrological connections between forests and streams on this landscape to determine the full effects of timber harvesting on the hydrology and biology of a watershed and its streams.

AB  - Root turnover is a relevant process controlling carbon and nutrient cycles. Furthermore, root biomass could influence the effectiveness of riparian buffer systems with regard to immobilizing and processing soil water pollutants and improving soil quality. However, sampling root biomass presents many technical problems, because there is as yet no well-established method for assessment thereof. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of limited sampling depth on biomass assessment in four riparian buffers and on two different dates (January and June): a poplar forest, two mixed deciduous afforestations of different ages, and a grassy area. Although, for all systems, most root biomass was limited to the first 30 cm, detection of differences in root biomass among vegetation types depended strongly on sampling depth for both sampling dates. Furthermore, although the poplar forest presented one of the most stable root systems in terms of total biomass between the sampling dates, it was one of the most seasonally dynamic in terms of the amount and distribution with depth of root biomass. The results of this study suggest that a minimum sampling depth should be established for each study according to seasonal variation in vertical distribution of root biomass.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in three adjacent riparian sites (mixed vegetation, forest and grass). The highest DEA was found in the surface (0-30 cm) soil and varied between 0.7±0.1 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 5°C and 5.9±0.4 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 15°C. There was no significant difference (P >0.05) between the DEA in the uppermost (0-30 cm and 60-90 cm) soil depths under different vegetation covers. In the two deepest (120-150 cm and 180-210 cm) soil depths the DEA varied between 0.0±0.0 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 5°C and 4.4±0.9 mg N kg-1 day-1 at 15°C and was clearly associated with the accumulation of buried organic carbon (OC). Two threshold values of OC were observed before DEA started to increase significantly, namely 5 and 25 g OC kg-1 soil at 10-15°C and 5°C, respectively. In the three riparian sites N2O fluxes varied between a net N2O uptake of -0.6±0.4 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 and a net N2O emission of 2.5±0.3 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1. The observed N2O emission did not lead to an important pollution swapping (from water pollution to greenhouse gas emission). Especially in the mixed vegetation and forest riparian site highest N2O fluxes were observed upslope of the riparian site. The N2O fluxes showed no clear temporal trend.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is one of the main nutrients controlling algal production in aquatic systems. Proper management of P in agricultural production systems can greatly enhance our ability to combat pollution of aquatic environments. To address this issue, a decision support system (DSS) consisting of the Maryland Phosphorus Index (PI), diagnosis expert system (ES), prescription ES, and a nonpoint-source pollution model, Ground Water Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS), was developed and applied to an agricultural watershed in southern Sweden. This system can identify critical source areas (CSAs) regarding phosphorus losses within the watershed, make a diagnosis of probable causes, prescribe the most appropriate best management practices (BMPs), and test the environmental effects of the applied BMPs. The PI calculations identified small parts of the watershed as CSAs. Only 10.4% of the total watershed area in 1995 and 5.2% of the total watershed area in 1996 were classed as “high potential P movement.” Four probable causes (high P level in soil, excessive P fertilization, stream proximity, and subsurface drainage) and three BMPs (riparian buffer strips, reduced P fertilizer application, and P fertilizer incorporation) were identified by a diagnosis and prescription expert system. The GLEAMS simulations conducted for one selected CSA field for a 24-yr period showed that the recommended BMP reduced runoff P losses by 55% and sediment P losses by 71%, if applied from the first year. Results showed that using DSS may enable us to select a proper BMP implementation strategy and to realize the beneficial effect of BMPs on a long-term basis.

AB  - Results of a field survey of southern Wisconsin shallow lakes suggested that watershed (catchment basin) land use has a significant and adverse effect on zooplankton species richness. Zooplankton communities in lakes with no riparian buffer zone, in agriculture-dominated watersheds, contained about half as many species as lakes in least-impact watersheds. In that study, the age of the lake was not taken into account. It is possible that agricultural lakes, often artificial, were so recently-constructed that they had not yet accumulated the equilibrium number of species characteristic of older lakes. In other words, it is possible that the interpretation of the results of the previous study is fatally flawed, if the results were an artifact of lake age, rather than an effect of land use. The major aim of this current study was to determine the ages of agricultural lakes and of lakes in least-impact watersheds, to test for an effect of lake age on zooplankton species richness, using the same sites from the previous study. We used an anova approach to test the null hypothesis that two factors, watershed land use and lake age, had no systematic effect on zooplankton species richness. We determined the age of 35 shallow lakes, using aerial photos, satellite images, and interviews of resource managers and land owners. We identified five artificial agricultural sites and five artificial sites in least-impact prairie watersheds. The artificial sites in this study ranged from 3 to 37 years in age, while natural lakes dated from the melting of the last glacier, about 9500 years ago. Our results suggest, that because artificial lake made up only about a third of the sites, and for the range of lake age and watershed land use, lake age did not have a significant effect on zooplankton species richness, while land use had a highly significant adverse effect. These results pose a larger question for future research. Namely, how quickly do newly-constructed lakes attain the equilibrium number of species seen in the previous study, and what is the quantitative relationship between lake age and zooplankton richness?

AB  - Leaf litter plays a critical role in regulating ecological functions in headwater forest streams, whereas the effects of leaves on water quality in urbanized streams are not fully understood. This study examined the potential importance of leaf litter for the release and transformations of organic carbon and nutrients in urban streams, and compared the effects with other types of natural organic substrates (periphyton and stream sediment). Nutrients and organic carbon were leached from senescent leaves of 6 tree species in the laboratory with deionized water, and maximal releases, leaching rate constants, composition and bioavailability of the leached dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined. Stream substrates (leaf debris, rocks with periphyton, and sediment) were seasonally collected from urban and forest reference streams of the NSF Baltimore Long-term Ecological Research Site and incubated with overlying stream water to estimate areal fluxes of DOC and nitrogen. Leaf litter leaching showed large ranges in maximal releases of DOC (7.0–131� mg� g⁻¹), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON; 0.07–1.39� mg� g⁻¹) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP; 0.14–0.70� mg� g⁻¹) among tree species. DOC leaching rate constants, carbon to nitrogen ratios, and DOC bioavailability were all correlated with organic matter quality indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Results from substrate incubation experiments showed far higher DOC and DON release and nitrate retention with leaf debris than with sediment, or rocks with periphyton. DOC release from leaf debris was positively correlated with stream nitrate retention at residential and urban sites, with the highest values observed during the fall and lowest during the summer. This study suggests the potential importance of leaf litter quantity and quality on fostering DOC and nutrient release and transformations in urban streams. It also suggests that species-specific impacts of leaves should be considered in riparian buffer and stream restoration strategies.

AB  - A riparian buffer installed along streams is one alternative that can be used to reduce the delivery of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment to the stream. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) has been developed to simulate surface and subsurface riparian buffer hydrology, sediment transport, litter and sediment interactions, vegetation growth, and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics. For this model to accurately simulate transport and fate of nutrients in the shallow groundwater beneath a riparian buffer, the subsurface hydrology component must be verified. Two years of field data were utilized to evaluate and test the sensitivity of the hydrology component of REMM in the North Carolina Middle Coastal Plain. Daily simulated water table depth was compared to observed water table depths across a 15 m wide buffer. The simulated water table depth was sensitive to hydrologic parameters such as groundwater inputs from the upland into zone 3, stream depth, and buffer slope. Average absolute errors between simulated and observed water table depth were found to be 0.35 to 0.36 m, while relative errors ranged from 0.12 to 0.15 m. Simulated evapotranspiration (ET) was higher in zone 3 compared to zones 1 and 2, although all three zones were parameterized alike. Flow into the buffer from the stream is not simulated by REMM, although it occurred frequently during data collection. Estimates of ET should be improved for herbaceous and grass vegetation types to improve water table depth predictions. Also, for conditions where the stream contributes flow to the groundwater, an additional component in REMM is necessary.

AB  - Riparian buffer strip guidelines are under scrutiny in the River Njoro Watershed in Kenya. This study investigated soil properties (bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in different land use types (small scale agriculture in recent settlements, mixed agriculture in established peri-urban settlements, large-scale commercial agriculture, and the gazetted forest reference condition) and their adjacent buffer strips. Bulk density, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within 30-m riparian buffer strips adjacent to recent settlement land use areas were similar to those of the gazetted forest reference condition, but only bulk density of the buffer strips adjacent to peri-urban and commercial agriculture land use areas were similar to the gazetted forest reference condition. Phosphorus is a sensitive indicator of the impacts of human activity, as increased concentrations were observed with increasing scale of land use activity. For riparian buffers adjacent to recent settlements, soil phosphorus was significantly higher in buffers narrower than 30 m (5.01 mg P kg−1) than gazetted forest (3.40 mg P kg−1) but not significantly different for riparian buffers wider than 30 m (3.81 mg P kg−1) compared to gazetted forest. Based on the research, it is recommended that policies governing riparian buffer strips become (1) stricter, with the current “maximum” of 30 m considered a minimum; and (2) adaptive, with 30 m used in small-scale agricultural areas, and wider riparian buffer strips used in medium- and large-scale agricultural areas.

AB  - To investigate potential changes in soil microbial characteristics of riparian zones subject to chronic nitrogen influx, we conducted an N-addition experiment in a riparian forest in the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA. During 6 months, we quantified temporal changes in denitrification and respiration rates, microbial biomass, and bacterial and fungal activity, following single and repeated inorganic N additions to the near-stream zone ('zone 1') and the upslope area ('zone 2') within the riparian site. Zone 1 soil had significantly higher soil moisture, larger labile and microbial C and N pools, higher denitrification, bacterial and fungal respiration rates, and a lower pH than zone 2 soil. Over time, all added N was effectively removed from zone 1 soil by denitrification, regardless of whether N was added in a single large pulse or multiple small pulses. In contrast, added N did not significantly stimulate denitrification in zone 2 soil, which lacked sufficient anaerobicity and had lower labile C levels. In neither zone did N addition result in net N immobilization into microbial biomass, suggesting that microbial storage is not a major N-removal mechanism in this riparian forest. In both zones N additions slightly reduced microbial C and basal respiration, and increased fungal activity. Although bacterial activity was not significantly affected, the observation of increased bacterivorous nematode populations in N-amended soils suggests that bacterial production had been temporarily stimulated by N addition. However, it may be expected that long-term effects of chronic N influx mostly negatively affect microbial biomass and activity, which could threaten the seemingly indefinite N-removal potential of denitrifiers in N-loaded riparian systems.

AB  - Nitrogen saturation of riparian ecosystems may lead to leaching and loss of surface water quality. In the search for early warning signs of N-saturation, we conducted an N-addition experiment to evaluate the indicator potential of free-living nematodes. During 6 months, we measured changes in feeding and life strategy groups, following single high and repeated low inorganic N-additions to a near-stream zone ('zone 1') and an upslope area ('zone 2') within a riparian forest in the southeast Coastal Plain of Georgia. In both zones, N-addition significantly increased the number of bacterivores but not fungivores. Only bacterivores with r-selected life strategies increased. In this group, Rhabditinae multiplied after N-addition in both zones, but Neodiplogasteridae and Myolaimidae responded to N only in zone 1, and Cephalobidae only in zone 2. Microbivore correlations with microbial data, collected concomitantly (Ettema et al., 1999. Riparian soil response to surface nitrogen input: temporal changes in denitrification, labile and microbial C and N pools, and bacterial and fungal respiration. Soil Biology & Biochemistry 31, 1609-1624), were considerably stronger in N-amended treatments than in controls, suggesting that N-addition synchronized microbial-microbivorous dynamics. At the end of the experiment, bacterivore abundance returned to control levels, probably partly due to predation, as predator populations had considerably increased several months after the first N-addition. The increase in predator abundance was greater in the single high than repeated low N-addition treatments, as was the case for bacterivore populations. These results suggest that nematodes can be indicators of N-saturation. However, for practical application, it appears that these indicators could only be meaningful when monitored together with other system characteristics, such denitrification rates and litter N.

AB  - Fire-scar and stand-cohort records were used to estimate the number and timing of fire disturbance events that impacted riparian and adjacent sideslope Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) forests. Data were gathered from 49 stream segments on 24 separate streams on the east slope of the Washington Cascade Range. Upslope forests had more “traceable” disturbance events than riparian forests in each of the valley types with a mean difference of 8–62%. Approximately 55–73% of the total traceable fire disturbance for a stream segment occurred on either sideslope and 24–27% in the riparian forest. Plant association groups in the riparian forest had 25–42% fewer fire disturbance events than the same plant association group upslope. Fewer traceable disturbance events in riparian forests may indicate a reduced disturbance frequency or a more severe disturbance regime or both. The two sideslopes on either side of the riparian forest shared the same fire event in 65 and 54% of the recorded fire events on east/west and north/south sideslopes, respectively. Riparian forests shared fire events with adjacent sideslope forests 58–79% among valley types, and 64–76% among aspects. Shared fire events indicate significant continuity in fire disturbance between riparian and adjacent sideslope forests. Fire disturbance regimes of sideslope and riparian forests are quantitatively different, but interconnected through shared fire disturbance events. Disturbance events play a role in maintaining ecosystem integrity and we suggest that disturbance may need to be planned for in administratively defined riparian buffer strips to protect long-term ecological integrity of riparian and adjacent upslope forests.

AB  - 1. Although many studies have focussed on the effects of catchment land use on lotic systems, the importance of broad (catchment) and fine (segment/reach) scale effects on stream assemblages remain poorly understood. 2. Nine biological metrics for macrophytes (498 sites), benthic macroinvertebrates (491) and fish (478) of lowland and mountain streams in four ecoregions of France and Germany were related to catchment and riparian buffer land use using partial Redundancy Analysis and Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). 3. Lotic fauna was better correlated (mean max., r = 0.450) than flora (r = 0.277) to both scales of land use: the strongest correlations were noted for mountain streams. BRTs revealed strong non‐linear relationships between mountain assemblage metrics and land use. Correlations increased with increasing buffer lengths, suggesting the importance of near‐stream land use on biotic assemblages. 4. Several metrics changed markedly between 10–20% (mountain ecoregions) and 40–45% (lowland) of arable land use, irrespective of the buffer size. At mountain sites with >10% catchment arable land use, metric values differed between sites with <30% and sites with >30% forest in the near‐stream riparian area. 5. These findings support the role of riparian land use in catchment management; however, differences between mountain and lowland ecoregions support the need for ecoregion‐specific management.

AB  - Studies on riparian buffers have usually focused on the amount of land needed as habitat for the terrestrial life stages of semiaquatic species. Nevertheless, the landscape surrounding wetlands is also important for other key processes, such as dispersal and the dynamics of metapopulations. Multiple elements that influence these processes should therefore be considered in the delineation of buffers. We analyzed landscape elements (forest cover, density of roads, and hydrographic network) in concentric buffers to evaluate the scale at which they influence stream amphibians in 77 distinct landscapes. To evaluate whether our results could be generalized to other contexts, we determined whether they were consistent across the study areas. Amphibians required buffers of 100-400 m of suitable terrestrial habitat, but interspecific differences in the amount of habitat were large. The presence of amphibians was related to roads and the hydrographic network at larger spatial scales (300-1500 m), which suggests that wider buffers are needed with these elements. This pattern probably arose because these elements influence dispersal and metapopulation persistence, processes that occur at large spatial scales. Furthermore, in some cases, analyses performed on different sets of landscapes provided different results, which suggests caution should be used when conservation recommendations are applied to disparate areas. Establishment of riparian buffers should not be focused only on riparian habitat, but should take a landscape perspective because semiaquatic species use multiple elements for different functions. This approach can be complex because different landscape elements require different spatial extents. Nevertheless, a shift of attention toward the management of different elements at multiple spatial scales is necessary for the long-term persistence of populations.

AB  - Forestry on peatland throughout the world is now focused on minimising destructive effects to the surrounding environment, especially during harvesting. These effects may be mitigated through the use of well-developed riparian buffers zones (RBZs). However, much of the commercial forestry planted in Ireland and the UK in the mid-20th century was planted without adequate RBZs. The creation of new RBZs prior to clearfelling may be a possible mitigation measure in these circumstances. The aim of this paper was to assess the nutrient content and phosphorus (P) adsorption capacity of the soil, and survival of planted saplings in a RBZ, positioned downslope from a standing forest and partly covered with brash mats, five years after its establishment. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were significantly higher under the brash mats in the RBZ when compared to all other areas. The standing forest had the highest concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH₄-N), while total oxidised nitrogen (TON) was similar for all areas. Water extractable phosphorus and desorption–adsorption testing also confirmed the high concentrations of P under the brash mats, but P did not leach through the peat to the stream. The overall survival rate of the saplings was relatively high, with over half of Quercus robur (oak) (57%), Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) (57%) and Betula pendula (birch) (51%) surviving. Salix cinerea (willow) (22%), Alnus glutinosa (alder) (25%) and Ilex aquifolium (holly) (44%) did not survive as successfully. The RBZ was capable of providing nutrients for the survival of planted saplings, fertilizing the peat with degrading brash material and preventing elevated levels of nutrients entering the adjacent aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - In this paper the potential of five hybrid poplar clones (Populus spp.) to provide biomass and wood volume in the riparian zone is assessed in four agroecosystems of southern Quebec (Canada). For all variables measured, significant Site effects were detected. Survival, biomass yield and volume yield were highest at the Bromptonville site. After 6 years of growth, total aboveground biomass production (stems + branches + leaves) reached 112.8 tDM/ha and total leafless biomass production (stems + branches) reached 101.1 tDM/ha at this site, while stem wood volume attained 237.5 m3/ha. Yields as low as 14.2 tDM/ha for total biomass and 24.8 m3/ha for total stem volume were also observed at the Magog site. Highest yields were obtained on the most fertile sites, particularly in terms of NO3 supply rate. Mean stem volume per tree was highly correlated with NO3 supply rate in soils (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.001). Clone effects were also detected for most of the variables measured. Total aboveground biomass and total stem volume production were high for clone 3729 (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) (73.1 tDM/ha and 134.2 m3/ha), although not statistically different from clone 915311 (P. maximowiczii × P. balsamifera). However, mean whole-tree biomass (including leaves) was significantly higher for clone 3729 (38.8 kgDM/tree). Multifunctional agroforestry systems such as hybrid poplar riparian buffer strips are among the most sustainable ways to produce a high amount of biomass and wood in a short time period, while contributing to alleviate environmental problems such as agricultural non-point source pollution.

AB  - Riparian vegetation has a critical role to play in non-point source pollution abatement and water quality protection within watersheds in agricultural areas. In addition to their water quality function, riparian buffers also have the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon (C). In this study, the C and nutrient sequestration by five unrelated hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) clones growing in the riparian zone of four southern Quebec (Canada) agroecosystems is measured aboveground after 6 years of growth and compared to free-growing (unmanaged) herbaceous buffer strips. Very large differences in C sequestration and nutrient accumulation in hybrid poplar buffers were observed across the four agricultural riparian sites. For all variables measured in this study, the largest effect detected by the ANOVA was the Site effect. While C sequestration, N and P accumulation in total aboveground biomass were, respectively 52tha⁻¹, 770kgha⁻¹ and 82kgha⁻¹ at the Bromptonville site, these values were as low as 6.4tha⁻¹, 90kgha⁻¹ and 10kgha⁻¹ at the Magog site. Site fertility, in terms of NO₃ supply rate, was the main factor controlling biomass growth, and consequently C sequestration and nutrient accumulation in hybrid poplars. Although Site effect was by far the largest effect in this study, the Clone effect was also important, with clone 3729 (Populus nigra L.× Populus maximowiczii A. Henry) being the most effective for C and nutrient sequestration. Across the four study sites, total aboveground C sequestration, N and P accumulation at the site level could be, respectively enhanced by 31-37%, 29-41% and 30-38% with the sole use of clone 3729. Site×Clone interactions for the variables tested in this study were generally not significant, or significant but small in magnitude compared to main effects (Site and Clone). Important C and nutrient accumulation differences exist after 6 years of growth between hybrid poplar buffers and unmanaged herbaceous buffers. Compared to an unmanaged herbaceous buffer, the distinct advantage of hybrid poplar buffers is that C and nutrient sequestration greatly increase with increasing site fertility, whereas they do so to a much lesser extent in herbaceous buffers.

AB  - The fate and transport of atrazine and three of its major degradation products were studied in a restored forested riparian buffer system in southern Georgia to examine the effectiveness of the system in attenuating the chemicals. Atrazine was applied to a 10 x 100 m strip immediately upslope from the buffer system, and atrazine, deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, and hydroxyatrazine were monitored in groundwater, soil, and runoff water for 11 months following application. Atrazine removal from groundwater was very effective, with the calculated 3810 mg entering the upslope position being reduced to 174 mg exiting the streamside landscape position. Each of the landscape positions (0, 8, 13, 18, 28, and 38 m from the application strip) in the buffer system contributed significantly to the atrazine concentration reduction in the initial three months following application, when the majority of atrazine was measured. Deethylatrazine is the primary result of biotic degradation and was the predominant degradation product in groundwater, with approximately 10% (379 mg) as much estimated to have entered the upper interface of the buffer system as did the parent atrazine. The riparian buffer system was successful in significantly reducing concentrations of deethylatrazine in groundwater in both the initial three months following application and in the final eight months of the study. Adsorption of the analytes to subsurface soils was minimal in this system. Deethylatrazine was also the predominant degradation product in the runoff water, but hydroxyatrazine was predominant in conjunction with runoff sediments. Removal efficiency of analyte mass loads in surface runoff water ranged from 92% to 100% as the chemicals were transported through the buffer system. While the mass load of atrazine associated with sediment was only 8% of that measured for the water phase, the mass loads of deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine (approximately 40%) and particularly hydroxyatrazine (75%) in sediments were proportionally much higher. About 98.6% of measured runoff water and sediment phase transport of atrazine occurred within the first few days following application as a result of an extended rainfall event. In contrast, roughly 45% of the deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine and only 16% of the hydroxyatrazine were measured in the first rain event sample. The results of this work indicate that riparian buffer systems can be successfully used to intercept atrazine and the studied degradation products in order to minimize contamination of natural water systems. Riparian buffers can provide year round attenuation, particularly for deethylatrazine. The importance of timing atrazine application to correspond with periods when there is no threat of rainfall is also emphasized.

AB  - With the increased number of large animal production facilities in eastern North Carolina, nutrient accumulation is becoming a problem in surface waters and groundwater. To protect these water sources, management practices to reduce nutrient movement or accumulation are being evaluated using computer models. The computer models, Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) and a version of Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM), were used to estimate nitrogen and phosphorus transport of nutrients through a riparian buffer zone from an agricultural field that received swine lagoon effluent. The models simulated annual application rates of effluent equivalent to 500 and 1000 kg N/ha. The GLEAMS model provided the weather data and nutrient concentrations in the soil, sediment, and leachate for input into REMM. Assuming a 1000 kg N/ha loading rate, GLEAMS monthly average NO3-N leachate concentrations were within 14% of the observed data, and REMM-simulated NO3-N leachate concentration was within 5% of the observed data. Both models provided an adequate estimation of nitrogen transport through the system. GLEAMS simulations of PO4-P leachate followed the general trend of observed data. However, there was no apparent response in simulated PO4-P leachate concentrations for the two loading rates (95 and 190 kg P/ha), indicating a problem in the phosphorus calculations in the model. The REMM-simulated PO4-P leachate was greater than observed concentrations and was affected by the inputs obtained from GLEAMS. The pre-release version of REMM provided good estimates of the nutrient transport, and with a few improvements, official releases of REMM have the potential to provide better estimates of nutrient movement through the riparian buffer zone.

AB  - Insects are major contributors to farmland biodiversity, and their economic roles are also diverse. Many herbivorous species are crop pests, while predatory insects have the potential to act as biological controls against pests. Overall insect diversity has declined as a result of intensified agricultural practices. Riparian buffers may support insect populations in intensively cultivated areas, but their actual impact on the balance between harmful pests and beneficial predators is not known. It can be postulated that this impact may vary depending on the characteristics and location of the riparian buffer itself. We investigated the possibility that the biotic and abiotic attributes of agricultural riparian buffers adjoining crop fields and watercourses can explain the species composition of hemipteran assemblages. In particular, we were interested in the abundances of species belonging to the genus Nabis (generalist predators) and recognized and potential pests of cereal crops. Riparian buffer width and the presence or absence of woody plants were not associated with hemipteran species turnover among riparian buffers. In contrast, differences in the degree of dominance by grasses, in plant species turnover, and in which crop plant was cultivated in the adjacent field, explained a significant proportion of the variance in hemipteran species turnover. The abundance of predatory Nabis species increased with increasing riparian buffer width, whereas the abundance of recognized and potential crop pests decreased. The reverse patterns in the predatory and herbivorous Heteroptera suggest that increasing riparian buffer width might enhance biological control by Nabis predators.

AB  - Efforts to manage National Forests in the USA for wood production, while protecting water quality, are currently constrained by models that do not address the temporal dynamics of variable non-point source (NPS) areas. NPS areas are diffuse sources of contaminants contributed mostly by runoff as a result of different land use activities. Riparian vegetative buffers are often used to control contaminants from NPS areas but defining suitable widths require different policy considerations. In this study, the approach for defining suitable buffer widths is to apply a distributed process-based model that predicts potential NPS areas prone to generating runoff in relation to overland flow distances. A case study of the concept was applied to the 72km² Pete King watershed located in the Clearwater National Forest (CNF) in central Idaho, USA. This grid modeling approach is based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) and it integrates the soil moisture routing (SMR) model with probabilistic analysis. The SMR model is a daily water balance model that simulates the hydrology of forested watersheds using real or stochastically generated climate data, a digital elevation model, soil, and land use data. The probabilistic analysis incorporates the variability of soil depth and accounts for uncertainties associated with the prediction of NPS areas using Monte Carlo simulation. A 1-year simulation for the case study location was performed to examine the spatial and temporal changes in NPS areas prone to generating runoff. The results of the simulation indicate that the seasonal variability of saturated areas determines the spatial dynamics of the potential NPS pollution. Use of this model for the design of riparian buffer widths would increase the effectiveness of decision-making in forest management and planning by mapping or delineating NPS areas likely to transport contaminants to perennial surface water bodies.

AB  - Conservation practices, such as buffers, are often installed to mitigate the effects of nutrients and sediment runoff from agricultural practices. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was developed as process-based model to evaluate the fate of nutrients and sediment through a riparian buffer up to the edge of a stream. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was performed on REMM to evaluate the effects that changing herbaceous buffer scenarios have on N, P, and sediment in surface and ground water. Vegetation characteristics such as rooting depth, LAI, and plant height, along with some physical buffer characteristics were varied within their "typical" range and compared to a "base case" scenario. Model outputs were not sensitive to plant height or LAI, but moderately sensitive to changes in SLA. Model outputs were only sensitive to rooting depth as roots became shallower in the soil profile. Sediment yield and dissolved nitrate in surface water were the most sensitive to changes in Manning's n, while other soil physical characteristics such as surface roughness, surface condition, and % bare soil had little to no effect on model outcomes. Dissolved surface nitrate, organic P, and dissolved subsurface nitrate were all moderately sensitive to changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity and the slope of the buffer. Results indicate that within the model, many vegetation characteristics do not directly play a role in the physical transport of nutrients and sediment in surface and subsurface water; therefore, utilizing REMM to evaluate effects of specific herbaceous plant types may have limited value unless specific leaf area or rooting depth are considered. It would be possible to model and perhaps achieve specific load reductions by modifying slope and other physical characteristics or by considering forest versus grass buffers.

AB  - 1. The EU ‘Nitrates Directive’ (Directive 91/676/EEC) and the WFD (Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EEC) introduced a series of measures designed to reduce and prevent water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to control the nitrate concentration in freshwater. The objective of this paper was to verify the potential capacity of a specifically designed afforested riparian zone in removing the excess of nitrogen from river water. 2. A buffer zone was set with irrigation ditches, to produce a subsurface water flow carrying water from the study river through the buffer strip to drainage ditches. This experimental system enables the co‐occurrence of two main processes: vegetation/microbial nitrogen uptake and denitrification. Both in situ denitrification and denitrification potential were measured at different soil depths, and nitrogen removal of water passing through the buffer system was measured. 3. After the first year, high removal rates (63–64%) of total nitrogen in water were recorded. The lowest rate of denitrification took place in the upper soil layer, while maximum denitrification occurred in the medium layer (40–55 cm). Denitrification occurred mainly in the first few metres of the irrigation ditches leading away from the river. The denitrification rates clearly increased from the second to the third year, with highest rates in summer and autumn. Denitrification potential indicated that carbon availability was the most limiting factor. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that nitrogen levels can be reduced in rivers by forcing water to circulate through afforested buffers. Nitrogen was removed both by plants and by microbial denitrification. Such activity can be supported by promoting anoxic conditions through appropriate water flow management. This could be achieved by creating semi‐natural floodplains where water flows can be efficiently managed as in a drained wetland.

AB  - Intact riparian zones maintain aquatic–terrestrial ecosystem function and ultimately, waterway health. Effective riparian management is a major step towards improving the condition of waterways and usually involves the creation of a ‘buffer’ by fencing off the stream and planting vegetation. Determination of buffer widths often reflects logistical constraints (e.g. private land ownership, existing infrastructure) of riparian and adjacent areas, rather than relying on rigorous science. We used published information to support riparian width recommendations for waterways in agricultural Victoria, Australia. We focused on different ecological management objectives (e.g. nutrient reduction or erosion control) and scrutinised the applicability of data across different environmental contexts (e.g. adjacent land use or geomorphology). Not surprisingly, the evidence supported variable ‘effective’ riparian widths, depending on the objective and environmental context. We used this information to develop a framework for determining riparian buffer widths to meet a variety of ecological objectives in south‐east Australia. Widths for reducing nutrient inputs to waterways were most strongly supported with quantitative evidence and varied between 20 and 38 m depending on environmental context. The environmental context was inconsistently reported, making it difficult to recommend appropriate widths, under different land‐use and physiographic scenarios. The evidence to guide width determination generally had high levels of uncertainty. Despite the considerable amount of published riparian research, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that implemented widths achieved ecological objectives. We emphasise the need for managers to clearly articulate the objectives of proposed riparian management and carefully consider the environmental context. Monitoring ecological responses associated with different riparian buffer widths is essential to support future management decisions.

AB  - In certain regions of Canada and the United States, amphibians have been shown to be sensitive to forest management and the short-term adverse effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial amphibians have been well documented in the literature. However, the effects of silvicultural treatments on amphibians may not be realized until many years after treatment. Manipulative forest management experiments with pre- and post-treatment data, random assignment of replicates to treatments, and analyses over a large spatial scale are rare in the literature. Furthermore, even studies with pre- and post-treatment data can be affected by ecological time lags; the longevity of some species may mean that it could take several years to observe a treatment effect. Riparian areas in forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest have been recognized for high species richness of amphibians yet little is known about the persistence of amphibians in mature forest fragments such as unharvested riparian buffers surrounded by clearcuts. Our study investigated the efficacy, 2 and 10years post-logging, of two different riparian management zone prescriptions established around third- and fourth-order streams in western Washington to mitigate the effects of upland timber harvest on amphibians. Our findings suggest that there is no global response by terrestrial amphibians to logging or to the retention of riparian management zones. Rather, species showed individual responses that varied over time and between treatments and transects. Specifically Coastal Tailed Frogs (Ascaphus truei) declined in clearcut upland habitats 2- and 10-years following logging while Western Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon vehiculum) and Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) appear to benefit from the recommended riparian management zone width. The influence of site effects was evident for some species, whereas for others there is some suggestion of treatment effects, but the analyses were confounded by patterns of natural population change at both local and regional scales, which were evident 2years following logging. Our results exemplify the need for longer-term studies to ensure that potentially confounding factors, such as natural population fluctuation, are considered when interpreting the results of time series data.

AB  - Nitate retention in riparian buffer strips is well documented in summer periods, but the potential of winter retention within these zones is poorly documented. Two sites, grass (Lolium perenne L.), and poplar (Populus italica)-vegetated riparian strips, were investigated in southern England (River Leach). Groundwater flow was via subsurface pathways within the sites, NO3- concentration gradients and loading rates were calculated over the winter period. Nitrate retention was found to be linearly dependent on load rate. Nitrate retention occurred at the edge of the riparian zone. This was most obvious in the poplar site where all hillslope-derived NO3 was absorbed within the first 5 m of flow within the riparian strip. When loading rates into the sites increased, NO3 absorption migrated upslope from the riparian site. The poplar-vegetated riparian zone was found to be more resilient (99% retention of NO3-) than the grass-vegetated riparian zone (84% retention of NO3-) in the winter months. It is postulated that although vegetation has no active role in retaining NO3- in the winter, above-ground vegetative biomass does contribute C to the soil microbacterial biomass that is engaged in NO3- reduction in the winter months, this accounted for the greater efficiency of the poplar vegetated site.

AB  - Buffer zones are an important component of forest-management strategies and are thought to reduce the impact of nutrients released after harvesting on water quality. Conceptually, steep slopes have shorter water residence times than shallow slopes, have a reduced capacity to moderate water quality, and therefore, require wider buffers. Carbon and N concentrations in riparian zone shallow soil water at 30 cm depth and lake water were measured on shallow and steep slopes at the Esker Lakes Research Area in northeastern Ontario to determine if nutrient concentrations were correlated to catchment terrain attributes. Field measured slope, slope class obtained from a triangular irregular network model, and upslope contributing area and topographic index calculated from a digital elevation model were calculated for each sampling location. Modeled terrain properties, including those currently used during forest-management planning, were not significantly correlated with soil water N and C concentrations, whereas only dissolved organic carbon levels were significantly greater on field measured steep slopes. Forest species composition and soil N levels were positively correlated with soil water N concentrations. These results from the undisturbed boreal ecosystem highlight the potential limitation of using only catchment slope as a tool for prescribing riparian buffers during harvesting when considering terrestrial nutrient export.

AB  - Riparian buffer zones are known to reduce diffuse N pollution of streams by removing and modifying N from agricultural runoff. Denitrification, often identified as the key N removal process, is also considered as a major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The risks of high N2O emissions during nitrate mitigation and the environmental controls of emissions have been examined in relatively few riparian zones and the interactions between controls and emissions are still poorly understood. Our objectives were to assess the rates of N2O emission from riparian buffer zones that receive large loads of nitrate, and to evaluate various factors that are purported to control N emissions. Denitrification, nitrification, and N2O emissions were measured seasonally in grassland and forested buffer zones along first-order streams in the Netherlands. Lateral nitrate loading rates were high, up to 470 g N m−2 yr−1 Nitrogen process rates were determined using flux chamber measurements and incubation experiments. Nitrous oxide emissions were found to be significantly higher in the forested (20 kg N ha−1 yr−1) compared with the grassland buffer zone (2–4 kg N ha−1 yr−1), whereas denitrification rates were not significantly different. Higher rates of N2O emissions in the forested buffer zone were associated with higher nitrate concentrations in the ground water. We conclude that N transformation by nitrate-loaded buffer zones results in a significant increase of greenhouse gas emission. Considerable N2O fluxes measured in this study indicate that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodologies for quantifying indirect N2O emissions have to distinguish between agricultural uplands and riparian buffer zones in landscapes receiving large N inputs.

AB  - Riparian buffers are designed as management practices to increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff and transport of sediment and nonpoint source pollutants from crop fields to adjacent streams. Achieving these ecosystem service goals depends, in part, on their ability to remove water from the soil via transpiration. In these systems, edges between crop fields and trees of the buffer systems can create advection processes, which could influence water use by trees. We conducted a field study in a riparian buffer system established in 1994 under a humid temperate climate, located in the Corn Belt region of the Midwestern U.S. (Iowa). The goals were to estimate stand level transpiration by the riparian buffer, quantify the controls on water use by the buffer system, and determine to what extent advective energy and tree position within the buffer system influence individual tree transpiration rates. We primarily focused on the water use response (determined with the Heat Ratio Method) of one of the dominant species (Acer saccharinum) and a subdominant (Juglans nigra). A few individuals of three additional species (Quercus bicolor, Betula nigra, Platanus occidentalis) were monitored over a shorter time period to assess the generality of responses. Meteorological stations were installed along a transect across the riparian buffer to determine the microclimate conditions. The differences found among individuals were attributed to differences in species sap velocities and sapwood depths, location relative to the forest edge and prevailing winds and canopy exposure and dominance. Sapflow rates for A. saccharinum trees growing at the SE edge (prevailing winds) were 39% greater than SE interior trees and 30% and 69% greater than NW interior and edge trees, respectively. No transpiration enhancement due to edge effect was detected in the subdominant J. nigra. The results were interpreted as indicative of advection effects from the surrounding crops. Further, significant differences were document in sapflow rates between the five study species, suggesting that selection of species is important for enhancing specific riparian buffer functions. However, more information is needed on water use patterns among diverse species growing under different climatic and biophysical conditions to assist policy and management decisions regarding effective buffer design.

AB  - Upwind advective energy occurring in edge environments may increase tree water use. In humid agricultural landscapes, advection-enhanced transpiration in riparian buffers may provide hydrologic regulation. The objectives of this study were to determine how water use by trees growing in a riparian buffer in central Iowa is influenced by 1) advective energy, 2) tree position, and 3) thinning (40% LAI reduction). We measured meteorological variables and sap flux density from July to September in 13 trees (2009) and 12 trees (2010) in one thinned plot (TP, treated in Aug 2010) and one untreated (control) plot (UP). The difference in Qs between edge and interior trees (39% higher in 2009) was attributed to the advective energy at the buffer edge. After thinning, maximum Qs increased was greater in TP compared to UP, explained primarily by solar radiation (R2=0.7, p<0.05), since meteorological conditions were not optimal for advection. However, the LAI reduction counteracted the increase in whole tree Qs, such that post-treatment plot transpiration per LAI measured from TP (0.4 mm day-1) was less than for UP (0.5 mm day-1).

AB  - Restoration of ecosystem functions in urban environments is made challenging by 1) a public that often lacks understanding of ecological principles, 2) inadequate evidence of the effectiveness of restoration practices, and 3) difficulty integrating social and biophysical factors in studies of urban ecosystems. This paper describes a case study in which potential solutions to these challenges were explored. We facilitated collaborative learning through public participation in the design and implementation of an urban riparian buffer along a headwater stream in a neighborhood park, a process that was informed by ecological research. Learning outcomes were evaluated using surveys and qualitative assessment of discussion. Results indicated that participants' knowledge about water quality problems associated with urbanization, stormwater, and nonpoint-source pollution increased, familiarity with stormwater management practices increased, and perceptions about the importance of stream ecosystem functions changed. In-stream monitoring of sediment delivery, as well as direct measurements of buffer infiltration capacity, provided early evidence of buffer effectiveness in prevention of sediment inputs to the stream and absorption of runoff from surrounding surfaces. This study provides a useful model for integration of collaborative learning through participation, ecological restoration, and ecological research in an urban setting. Elements deemed essential to success of this model included an opportunity for dialog focused on a specific natural feature, sustained interaction between participants and researchers, opportunities for hands-on participation by urban residents, and flexibility in restoration practice installation.

AB  - Ground water and surface water interactions are of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical processes governing phosphorus (P) dynamics in riparian buffers. The four most important conceptual hydrological pathways for P losses from and P retention in riparian buffers are reviewed in this paper: (i) The diffuse flow path with ground water flow through the riparian aquifer, (ii) the overland flow path across the riparian buffer with water coming from adjacent agricultural fields, (iii) irrigation of the riparian buffer with tile drainage water from agricultural fields where disconnected tile drains irrigate the riparian buffer, and (iv) inundation of the riparian buffer (floodplain) with river water during short or longer periods. We have examined how the different flow paths in the riparian buffer influence P retention mechanisms theoretically and from empirical evidence. The different hydrological flow paths determine where and how water-borne P compounds meet and interact with iron and aluminum oxides or other minerals in the geochemical cycling of P in the complex and dynamic environment that constitutes a riparian buffer. The main physical process in the riparian buffer--sedimentation--is active along several flow paths and may account for P retention rates of up to 128 kg P ha-1 yr-1, while plant uptake may temporarily immobilize up to 15 kg P ha-1 yr-1. Retention of dissolved P in riparian buffers is not as pronounced as retention of particulate P and is often below 0.5 kg P ha-1 yr-1. Several studies show significant release of dissolved P (i.e., up to 8 kg P ha-1 yr-1).

AB  - As demand for energy increases in the United States, alternative energy sources are being sought both domestically and abroad. Biofuels have been promoted as a major source of alternative energy, but sustainable supply of biomass still remains a major challenge. Agroforestry offers a potential way to integrate perennial woody bioenergy crops with traditional agricultural crops to satisfy energy demands without sacrificing food production in the North Central Region of the United States. We suggest shelterbelts, alley cropping and working riparian buffer strips as ideal candidates for biomass production in agroforestry settings in this region. In addition to satisfying domestic energy demands, these systems could also potentially increase water quality, sequester carbon, improve aesthetics, and provide critical wildlife habitat. However, obstacles to implementing agroforestry systems for biomass production, such as a competitive price structure and stable markets, must be overcome before large-scale adoption by landowners.

AB  - The distributions of freshwater mussels are controlled by landscape factors operating at multiple spatial scales. Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) have been implicated in severe population declines and range contractions of freshwater mussels across North America. Despite widespread recognition of multiscale influences few studies have addressed these issues when developing distribution models. Furthermore, most studies have disregarded the role of landscape pattern in regulating aquatic species distributions, focusing only on landscape composition. In this study, the distribution of Rabbitsfoot (Quadrula cylindrica) in the upper Green River system (Ohio River drainage) is modeled with environmental variables from multiple scales: subcatchment, riparian buffer, and reach buffer. Four types of landscape environment metrics are used, including: LULC pattern, LULC composition, soil composition, and geology composition. The study shows that LULC pattern metrics are very useful in modeling the distribution of Rabbitsfoot. Together with LULC compositional metrics, pattern metrics permit a more detailed analysis of functional linkages between aquatic species distributions and landscape structure. Moreover, the inclusion of multiple spatial scales is necessary to accurately model the hierarchical processes in stream systems. Geomorphic features play important roles in regulating species distributions at intermediate and large scales while LULC variables appear more influential at proximal scales.

AB  - Spatial variations in the N₂O emissions and denitrification potential of riparian buffer strips (RBS) in a polluted river were examined. The river received large pollutant inputs from urban runoff and wastewater discharge, resulting in impaired water quality in the river and downstream reservoir. The potential for nitrogen removal by RBS was evaluated by measuring in situ N₂O emission fluxes in static closed chambers and sediment denitrification potentials with acetylene inhibition techniques. The results showed that N₂O emission fluxes decreased from the upstream (16.39 μg/(m²·h)) to downstream (0.30 μg/(m²·h)) sites and from the water body to upland sites. The trend in decreasing N₂O emission fluxes in the downstream direction was mainly associated with sediment/soil textures (clay loam→sandy soil) and sediment/soil water contents and was also related to the vegetation along the RBS and nutrients in the sediments/soils. The correlation coefficient was highest (r=0.769) between the N₂O emission flux and sediment/soil water content. Sediment/soil denitrification potentials under N-amended and ambient conditions were higher (highest 32.86 mg/(kg·h)) for the upstream sites, which were consistent with in situ N₂O flux rates.

AB  - A study was conducted to determine the impact of different forest management techniques on shallow groundwater quality in coastal plain riparian zones. Considerable past research had shown that riparian zones are effective in removing or assimilating nitrates entering from upslope agricultural fields via shallow lateral flow, but the impact of different forest management techniques on this process was unknown. The study was conducted at a site near Tifton, Georgia, on a second-order coastal plain stream. The riparian buffer system consisted of a grass buffer, a managed forest zone, and a forest zone adjacent to the stream. Three forest treatments were studied: mature forest (MF), clearcut (CC), and selective thinning (ST). Following a nine-month pretreatment period, trees were completely or selectively removed from the CC and ST treatments, respectively. Shallow groundwater quality was evaluated in networks of wells on transects extending downslope from the edge of the agricultural field to the stream. Results from the study showed that all three forest management treatments were effective in assimilating nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). Significant differences in NO3-N concentrations in the shallow groundwater between the three different treatments did not occur. The only statistically significant effect that was observed on groundwater quality was under the CC treatment, where solute concentrations (both NO3-N and chloride [Cl]) decreased after the tree cutting. This was attributed to a combination of effects including possible increased NO3-N uptake by rapidly growing vegetation, dilution associated with less evapotranspiration by young vegetation as compared to mature forest, and more throughfall of rainfall under the CC than under the other two treatments. No treatment effects were observed on ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) concentrations. Overall the study showed that regardless of forest management techniques, coastal plain riparian forests are effective in assimilating NO3-N.

AB  - Recent attention has focused on riparian forest buffer systems for filtering sediment, nutrients, and pesticides entering from upslope agricultural fields. Studies in a variety of physiographic areas have shown that concentrations of sediment and agrichemicals are reduced after passage through a riparian forest. The mechanisms involved are both physical and biological, including deposition, uptake by vegetation, and loss by microbiological processes such as denitrification. Current research by USDA-ARS and University of Georgia scientists at Tifton, GA is focusing on managing riparian forest buffer systems to alleviate agricultural impacts on the environment. The underlying concept for this research is that agricultural impact on streams is best protected by a riparian forest buffer system consisting of three zones. In consecutive upslope order from the stream these zones are (1) a narrow band of permanent trees (5-10 m wide) immediately adjacent to the stream channel which provides streambank stabilization, organic debris input to streams, and shading of streams, (2) a forest management zone where maximum biomass production is stressed and frees can be harvested, and (3) a grass buffer strip up to 10 m wide to provide control of coarse sediment and to spread overland flow. Several ongoing projects at Tifton, GA are focusing on using riparian forest buffer systems as filters. A forest management project is testing the effects of different management practices on surface and ground water quality. This project includes three different forest management practices: mature forest, selectively thinned forest, and clearcut. In a different study a natural wetland is being restored by planting frees. The effectiveness of this wetland on filtering nutrients from dairy wastes which are being applied upslope is being evaluated. At this same site, a pesticide study is being conducted on the side opposite to where dairy wastes are applied. An overland flow-riparian buffer system using swine lagoon waste is evaluating the effectiveness of different vegetative treatments and lengths of buffer zones on filtering of nutrients. In this study three vegetative treatments are compared: (1) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m riparian forest, (2) 20 m grass buffer and 10 m riparian forest, (3) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m of the recommended wetland species maidencane. Waste is applied at the upper end of each plot at either a high or low rate, and then allowed to flow downslope. The three zone riparian forest buffer system is being used for the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM). This model, which is currently under development at Tifton, GA, is a computer simulation model designed to reduce soil and water degradation by aiding farmers and land use managers in decision making regarding how best to utilize their riparian buffer system. Both information currently being collected in field studies and development of the REMM are innovative farm-level and forestry technologies to protect soil and water resources.

AB  - A three-year study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using riparian buffer systems to assimilate nitrogen (N) from swine lagoon effluent. Replicated 30X4 m plots were established at the interface of a pasture and riparian forest. Wastewater from the third lagoon of the University of Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station main swine research unit was applied to each plot by overland flow from tanks at the top end of each plot. The wastewater, which contained an average N concentration of 160 mg L-1 N, primarily as ammonium (NH4-N), was applied to the plots at three different rates (either once per week [1X, 1285 L/plot] or twice per week [2X, 2570 L/plot]). Three different vegetative buffer treatments were evaluated: (1) 10 m grass buffer draining into 20 m existing riparian zone vegetation; (2) 20 m grass buffer draining into 10 m existing riparian zone vegetation; and (3) 10 m grass buffer draining into 20 m maidencane (Panicum hematomon). The effects of the wastewater on surface runoff and groundwater quality were evaluated by transects of surface runoff collectors, suction lysimeters, and shallow groundwater wells which extended from the top to the bottom of each plot. Data analyses showed differences due to wastewater application rate and distance downslope from the wastewater application pipe. Nitrogen concentrations increased over time at the top ends of the plots but showed little increase at the bottom ends of the plots. Overall, all three vegetative treatments were successful in assimilating N from the wastewater. The study showed that riparian buffer systems, where wastewater is applied by overland flow, can be effective in assimilating N contained within lagooned animal wastes.

AB  - The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was used to simulate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) cycling and transport in a Coastal Plain riparian buffer system near Tifton, Georgia. The riparian buffer consisted of zone 3 (grass next to a row crop field); zone 2 (mature pine forest downslope from zone 3); and zone 1 (hardwood forest downslope from zone 2, adjacent to a stream). Uncalibrated simulation results for a five-year period were compared to measured values for the same time period at the research site. In general, simulated water table nutrient concentrations were within one standard deviation of observed values on an annual basis. Surface runoff loads exiting zone 3 for most N and P forms were simulated within one standard deviation of the observed. In contrast zone 2, surface runoff loads for inorganic N species were an order of magnitude lower than observed. Although some of the surface runoff differences (observed vs. simulated) were large in relative terms, the overall trends within the riparian buffer were generally well-represented and differences were not large in absolute terms. Simulated values for one of the most important processes responsible for effectiveness of riparian zones--denitrification, were within the range of those observed. Much of the temporal dynamics of the observed data were also captured in the REMM simulations. Certain constraints of the model use are discussed, but REMM appears to be useful for representing many of the specific processes and general trends in riparian ecosystem buffers.

AB  - The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was used to simulate shallow groundwater movement, water table depths, surface runoff, and annual hydrologic budgets for a Coastal Plain riparian buffer system near Tifton, Georgia, USA. The riparian buffer consisted of zone 3 (grass downslope from a row-crop field); zone 2 (mature pine forest downslope from zone 3); and zone 1 (mature hardwood forest downslope from zone 2, adjacent to stream). Measured surface runoff and shallow groundwater movement from the adjacent agricultural field were used as the hydrologic input to REMM. Uncalibrated simulation results for a five-year period were compared to measured values for the same time period. The overall error in zone 2 and zone 1 mean water table depths was about 0.07 m, although absolute errors were higher. The water table dynamics simulated by REMM were similar to observed although lags were observed in the response of the simulated water table to large rainfall events. Mixed results were obtained from observed versus simulated surface runoff comparisons, primarily due to large variability in observed runoff depths along the riparian transect. Simulated surface runoff depths for zone 3 were within one standard deviation for four out of the five years. For zone 2, surface runoff depths could only be simulated within one standard deviation for two out of the five years. Simulated seasonal total depths of surface runoff did not always agree with observed values but usually followed both similar temporal and spatial patterns. Annual hydrologic budgets produced total streamflow comparable to those estimated for the riparian buffer site. These results provide an adequate basis for subsequent testing of other REMM model components including water quality and nutrient cycling.

AB  - The relationships between habitat variables and population densities of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou), rosyface dace (Leuciscus ezoe), Siberian stone loach (Noemacheilus barbatulus) and wrinklehead sculpin (Cottus nozawae) were examined by data collected at 55 reaches in forest and grassland streams in northern Hokkaido, Japan. Regression analysis suggested that salmon and dace densities were affected by water temperature (negative for salmon, positive for dace) and structural habitat factors (woody debris for salmon, pools for dace). Salmon density was higher in forest reaches than in grassland reaches, whereas dace density was higher in grassland reaches, suggesting that the removal of riparian forest had raised water temperature and allowed upstream invasions by dace. In contrast to salmon and dace, neither the density of loach nor sculpin differed between the forest and grassland reaches. For their densities, a negative effect of each on the other was most important, suggesting a strong effect of interspecific competition between loach and sculpin on their distributions. However, regression models also suggested that substrate heterogeneity mediated the outcome of their interspecific competition. On the basis of the results, a scenario is predicted for a fish-assemblage change with a typical land-development process in Hokkaido, and the importance of leaving or restoring riparian buffer for conservation and restoration of stream habitat is emphasized.

AB  - Graphical models provide an important tool for facilitating communication between scientists, decision-makers, and statisticians—many complicated ecological processes can be described in terms of “box-and-arrow” conceptual diagrams (e.g., Shipley in Cause and correlation in biology: a user’s guide to path analysis, structural equations and causal inferences, Cambridge Universtiy Press, Cambridge, 2000; Clark and Gelfand TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution 21:375–380, 2006). In particular, problems in landscape ecology often involve modeling relationships among multiple physical and/or biological variables that may operate on differing spatial scales (e.g., Rossi et al. in Ecol Monographs 62:277–314, 1992; Legendre et al. in Ecography 25:601–615, 2002; Overmars et al. in Ecol Model 164:257–270, 2003; Brown and Spector in J Appl Ecol 45:1639–1648, 2008; Koniak and Noy-Meir in Ecol Model 220:1148–1158, 2008). These problems are inherently multivariate, though researchers commonly rely on univariate methods, such as spatial regression models, to address them. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate method—graphical spatial models—that extends path analysis to incorporate spatial autocorrelation in one or more variables in a directed graph. We show how both exogenous and endogenous ecological processes as defined by Legendre et al. (Ecography 25:601–615, 2002) and Lichstein et al. (Ecol Monographs 72:445–463, 2002) can be represented in a graph. Most importantly, we show how to translate graphs representing these ecological processes into statistically estimable models. We motivate our theoretical results using an example of stream health data from the Willamette Valley, Oregon. For these data we are interested in the spatial pattern within both riparian land use and an index of stream health, and whether there is an association between land use and stream health, after accounting for these spatial patterns. We use a graphical spatial model to address these ecological questions simultaneously. We find that the health of a stream decreases as the percent of developed land within a 120-m riparian buffer increases; interestingly, there is only evidence of spatial pattern within land use.

AB  - Conservation of soil and water resources is one of the key criteria underpinning sustainable forest management. While soil and water resources are important determinants of forest productivity, without appropriate assessment of soil erosion risk and the application of best management practices (BMPs), some forest management activities can adversely affect hillslope erosion rates with detrimental consequences for aquatic environments and downstream water users. In the multiple-use native eucalypt forests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, hazard matrix tables are currently used to identify soil erosion risk based upon rainfall erosivity, soil regolith stability and slope classes at the compartment scale prior to undertaking forestry activities. Resultant “inherent hazard levels” (IHLs) direct the BMPs to be used, such as riparian buffer widths, during harvesting and roading operations. The IHL model, being an ordinal classification system, only provides a relative indication of erosion potential without any quantitative estimate of possible post-harvest erosion rates. To potentially better identify erosion risk and quantify likely soil erosion under a range of forest management and climatic scenarios at the hillslope and/or catchment scale, in this paper we utilised an alternative approach by modelling soil erosion using the empirically-derived Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation in combination with a GIS-based spatially distributed raster analysis. In four case study catchments in Kangaroo River State forest, two of which were subjected to single-tree selection harvesting operations, mean annual changes in soil loss were estimated at a grid cell level. Potential differences in soil loss estimates were assessed before, during and after selective logging. Vegetation cover and soil samples were recorded in a 500×1000m rectangular network laid out across the catchments. Slope gradient was found to contribute substantially to the spatial variability of soil loss estimation across the catchments. However, between-year differences demonstrate that the highest estimated annual rates of soil loss occurred on steep hillslopes when high levels of rainfall were recorded, while the values on those same areas remained considerably lower during low rainfall periods. The major effect of the rainfall component in generating soil erosion overshadows the modest impacts of selective logging operations.

AB  - We examined stream temperature response to forest harvest in small (<9ha) forested headwater catchments in western Washington, USA over a seven year period (2002–2008). These streams have very low discharge in late summer X¯≈0.3Ls-1) and many become spatially intermittent. We used a before–after, control-impact (BACI) study design to contrast the effect of clearcut logging with two riparian buffer designs, a continuous buffer and a patch buffer. We focused on maximum daily temperature throughout July and August, expecting to see large temperature increases in the clearcut streams (n=5), much smaller increases in the continuously buffered streams (n=6), with the patch-buffered streams (n=5) intermediate. Statistical analyses indicated that all treatments resulted in significant (α=0.05) increases in stream temperature. In the first year after logging, daily maximum temperatures during July and August increased in clearcut catchments by an average of 1.5°C (range 0.2 to 3.6°C), in patch-buffered catchments by 0.6°C (range −0.1 to 1.2°C), and in continuously buffered catchments by 1.1°C (range 0.0 to 2.8°C). Temperature responses were highly variable within treatments and, contrary to our expectations, stream temperature increases were small and did not follow expected trends among the treatment types. We conducted further analyses in an attempt to identify variables controlling the magnitude of post-harvest treatment responses. These analyses showed that the amount of canopy cover retained in the riparian buffer was not a strong explanatory variable. Instead, spatially intermittent streams with short surface-flowing extent above the monitoring station and usually characterized by coarse-textured streambed sediment tended to be thermally unresponsive. In contrast, streams with longer surface-flowing extent above the monitoring station and streams with substantial stream-adjacent wetlands, both of which were usually characterized by fine-textured streambed sediment, were thermally responsive. Overall, the area of surface water exposed to the ambient environment seemed to best explain our aggregate results. Results from our study suggest that very small headwater streams may be fundamentally different than many larger streams because factors other than shade from the overstory tree canopy can have sufficient influence on stream energy budgets to strongly moderate stream temperatures even following complete removal of the overstory canopy.

AB  - Efficiency of non‐point source pollution control methods may be altered in future climate. This study investigated climate change impacts on sediment and nutrient transport, and efficiency of best management practices (BMPs), in the Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) in Mississippi. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was applied to the UPRW using observed flow, sediment and nutrient data. Water quality samples were collected at three US geological survey gauging stations. The model was successfully calibrated and validated for daily time steps (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination – R² up to 0.7) using manual and automatic (sequential uncertainty fitting version 2) methods from February 2010 to May 2011. Future weather scenarios were simulated using the LARS‐WG model, a stochastic weather generator, with Community Climate System Model, global climate model, which was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA. On the basis of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B, A2 and B1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change scenarios were simulated for the mid (2046–2065) and late (2080–2099) century. Effectiveness of four BMPs (Riparian buffer, stream fencing, sub‐surface manure applications and vegetative filter strips) on reducing sediment and nutrient were evaluated in current and future climate conditions. Results show that sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings will be increased up to a maximum of 26.3%, 7.3% and 14.3%, respectively, in future climate conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of BMPs on sediment removal will be reduced in future climate conditions, and the efficiency of nitrogen removal will be increased, whereas phosphorus removal efficiency will remain unchanged.

AB  - Riparian buffers are a proven practice for removing NO3 from overland flow and shallow groundwater. However, in landscapes with artificial subsurface (tile) drainage, most of the subsurface flow leaving fields is passed through the buffers in drainage pipes, leaving little opportunity for NO3 removal. We investigated the feasibility of re-routing a fraction of field tile drainage as subsurface flow through a riparian buffer for increasing NO3 removal. We intercepted an existing field tile outlet draining a 10.1-ha area of a row-cropped field in central Iowa and re-routed a fraction of the discharge as subsurface flow along 335 m of an existing riparian buffer. Tile drainage from the field was infiltrated through a perforated pipe installed 75 cm below the surface by maintaining a constant head in the pipe at a control box installed in-line with the existing field outlet. During 2 yr, >18,000 m3 (55%) of the total flow from the tile outlet was redirected as infiltration within the riparian buffer. The redirected water seeped through the 60-m-wide buffer, raising the water table approximately 35 cm. The redirected tile flow contained 228 kg of NO3. On the basis of the strong decrease in NO3 concentrations within the shallow groundwater across the buffer, we hypothesize that the NO3 did not enter the stream but was removed within the buffer by plant uptake, microbial immobilization, or denitrification. Redirecting tile drainage as subsurface flow through a riparian buffer increased its NO3 removal benefit and is a promising management practice to improve surface water quality within tile-drained landscapes.

AB  - Climate change may have profound effects on phosphorus (P) transport in streams and on lake eutrophication. Phosphorus loading from land to streams is expected to increase in northern temperate coastal regions due to higher winter rainfall and to a decline in warm temperate and arid climates. Model results suggest a 3.3 to 16.5% increase within the next 100 yr in the P loading of Danish streams depending on soil type and region. In lakes, higher eutrophication can be expected, reinforced by temperature-mediated higher P release from the sediment. Furthermore, a shift in fish community structure toward small and abundant plankti-benthivorous fish enhances predator control of zooplankton, resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. Data from Danish lakes indicate increased chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass, higher dominance of dinophytes and cyanobacteria (most notably of nitrogen fixing forms), but lower abundance of diatoms and chrysophytes, reduced size of copepods and cladocerans, and a tendency to reduced zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio when lakes warm. Higher P concentrations are also seen in warm arid lakes despite reduced external loading due to increased evapotranspiration and reduced inflow. Therefore, the critical loading for good ecological state in lakes has to be lowered in a future warmer climate. This calls for adaptation measures, which in the northern temperate zone should include improved P cycling in agriculture, reduced loading from point sources, and (re)-establishment of wetlands and riparian buffer zones. In the arid Southern Europe, restrictions on human use of water are also needed, not least on irrigation.

AB  - Climate change might have profound effects on the nitrogen (N) dynamics in the cultivated landscape as well as on N transport in streams and the eutrophication of lakes. N loading from land to streams is expected to increase in North European temperate lakes due to higher winter rainfall and changes in cropping patterns. Scenario (IPCC, A2) analyses using a number of models of various complexity for Danish streams and lakes suggest an increase in runoff and N transport on an annual basis (higher during winter and typically lower during summer) in streams, a slight increase in N concentrations in streams despite higher losses in riparian wetlands, higher absolute retention of N in lakes (but not as percentage of loading), but only minor changes in lake water concentrations. However, when taking into account also a predicted higher temperature there is a risk of higher frequency and abundance of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in lakes and they may stay longer during the season. Somewhat higher risk of loss of submerged macrophytes at increased N and phosphorus (P) loading and a shift to dominance of small-sized fish preying upon the key grazers on phytoplankton may also enhance the risk of lake shifts from clear to turbid in a warmer North European temperate climate. However, it must be emphasised that the prediction of N transport and thus effects is uncertain as the prediction of regional precipitation and changes in land-use is uncertain. By contrast, N loading is expected to decline in warm temperate and arid climates. However, in warm arid lakes much higher N concentrations are currently observed despite reduced external loading. This is due to increased evapotranspiration leading to higher nutrient concentrations in the remaining water, but may also reflect a low-oxygen induced reduction of nitrification. Therefore, the critical N as well as P loading for good ecological state in lakes likely has to be lower in a future warmer climate in both north temperate and Mediterranean lakes. To obtain this objective, adaptation measures are required. In both climate zones the obvious methods are to change agricultural practices for reducing the loss of nutrients to surface waters, to improve sewage treatment and to reduce the storm-water nutrient runoff. In north temperate zones adaptations may also include re-establishment of artificial and natural wetlands, introduction of riparian buffer zones and re-meandering of channelised streams, which may all have a large impact on, not least, the N loading of lakes. In the arid zone, also restrictions on human use of water are urgently needed, not least on the quantity of water used for irrigation purposes.

AB  - Relatively narrow (<50m) riparian buffers strategically reestablished in correct landscape positions have been shown to significantly reduce agricultural non-point source pollution to streams. Because of this, conservation programs have been established to encourage landowners to enroll lands near surface waters to improve water quality. Former cropland enrolled in a conservation program was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in reducing nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃ ⁻-N) in shallow groundwater. This conservation buffer (CB) was up to 80m wide and was planted with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). It was situated upslope of an existing 30–60m wide riparian hardwood forest buffer (EHB) located within the floodplain of an intermittent stream. Shallow groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N, groundwater hydrology, total organic carbon, and soil redox potential were measured throughout both the CB and the EHB for 18 months. Groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations, often 5–15mgL⁻¹ within the CB, were not significantly reduced from concentrations that entered from the agricultural field edge. However, a decrease in NO₃ ⁻-N concentration was observed within the EHB (17–83%). The hydrology of the CB coupled with relatively low organic carbon contributed to a low denitrification potential and lack of NO₃ ⁻-N reduction compared with the EHB. While the CB enrollment likely provided additional habitat benefits it did not appear to provide treatment of groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N. It is our conclusion that landscape position is a more important defining variable for buffer site selection than buffer width if NO₃ ⁻-N reduction is a primary goal.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are important elements in landscapes that often provide a disproportionately wide range of ecosystem services and conservation benefits. Their protection and restoration have been one of the top environmental management priorities across the US over the last several years. Despite the level of concern, visibility and management effort, little is known about trends in riparian habitats. Moreover, little is known about whether or not cumulative efforts to restore and protect riparian zones and floodplains are affecting the rates of riparian habitat change nationwide. To address these issues, we analyzed riparian land cover change between the early 1970s and the late 1990s/early 2000s using existing spatial data on hydrography and land cover. This included an analysis of land cover changes within 180 m riparian buffer zones, and at catchment scales, for 42,363 catchments across 63 ecoregions of the continental US. The total amount of forest and natural land cover (forests, shrublands, wetlands) in riparian buffers declined by 0.7 and 0.9%, respectively across the entire study period. Gains in grassland/shrubland accounted for the 0.2% lower percentage of total natural land cover loss relative to forests. Conversely, urban and developed land cover (urban, agriculture, and mechanically disturbed lands) increased by more than 1.3% within riparian buffers across the entire study period. Despite these changes, we documented an opposite trend of increasing proportions of natural and forest land cover in riparian buffers versus the catchment scale. We surmise that this trend might reflect a combination of natural recovery and cumulative efforts to protect riparian ecosystems across the US. However, existing models limit our ability to assess the impacts of these changes on specific ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of changes observed in this study on the sustainability of ecosystem services. We also recommend opportunties for future riparian change assessments.

AB  - In December 2008, the draft programmes of measures (PoM) have been published in the EU member states, which list the measures that will be taken to enhance the ecological status of surface and groundwater bodies, and to reach the environmental objectives of the EU‐Water Framework Directive (WFD). We have analysed the German PoM to identify the main pressures and the restoration measures water managers planned to implement in streams and rivers. The objective was to evaluate the PoM and to identify the main, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management on which applied river research should focus on. In general, the selection of measures in the PoM was reasonable. In accordance with the analysis of pressures and impacts in Germany, the PoM focussed on measures addressing morphological alterations and river continuity, and the results indicated that diffuse source pollution and fine sediment input were additional main pressures in Central European streams and rivers. Although point source pollution was not a main pressure in most rivers, respective point source measures have been selected for many water bodies. Apparently, these were so‐called basic measures that have to be taken due to other EU‐Directives or national laws. Therefore, although in line with the WFD, it seemed doubtful if the point source measures would help to substantially enhance the ecological status. Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge on the effect of restoration measures and a specific knowledge gap in how to enhance the ecological state of heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) in the lowland region with a high land‐use pressure, which was reflected by the high share of water bodies for which conceptual measures have been selected (e.g. developing management plans). Based on the analysis of the PoM and a literature review, we identified the following, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management: (i) the morphodynamics of river reaches where natural channel dynamics have been restored, (ii) the combined effect of measures addressing diffuse nutrient and fine sediment input at different spatial scales (e.g. riparian buffer strips and land‐use changes), (iii) methods to identify suitable and efficient measures and to define environmental objectives for HMWB and (iv) the effect of measures on less well‐studied biological groups like macrophytes and phytoplankton. There is a strong need to summarize recent research results on these issues, to identify the knowledge gaps and research needs in detail, and to make the results of such a comprehensive literature review or meta‐analysis available for the next 6‐year management cycle and second WFD management plans.

AB  - Conventional management of shoreline forest in harvested boreal landscapes involves retention of treed buffer strips to provide habitat for wildlife species and protect aquatic habitats from deleterious effects of harvesting. With shoreline forests being considered for harvest in several jurisdictions, it is important to determine the potential impacts of this disturbance on birds. In this study, responses of riparian- and upland-nesting birds to three levels of harvest (0%-50%, 50%-75%, and 75%-100% within 100 m of the water) in shoreline forests around boreal wetlands were assessed 1 year before and each year for 4 years after harvest relative to unharvested reference sites. Upland-nesting species showed variable responses to harvest, with greatest declines in abundance of interior forest nesting species (e.g., Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapillus L.) with the highest levels of harvest. Shrub-nesting and generalist species increased in abundance in harvest treatments relative to reference sites. Riparian birds showed little response to harvest, suggesting that shoreline forest harvest has little effect on their abundance up to 4 years after harvest. Retention of small buffers may not be an effective management strategy for conservation of birds occupying shoreline forests, particularly interior forest nesting species. We suggest that alternatives to conventional buffer management be explored.

AB  - The NST 3.0 mechanistic nutrient uptake model was used to explore P uptake to a depth of 120 cm over a 126 d growing season in simulated buffer communities composed of mixtures of cottonwood (Populus deltoids Bartr.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss). Model estimates of P uptake from pure stands of smooth brome and cottonwood were 18.9 and 24.5 kg ha−1, respectively. Uptake estimates for mixed stands of trees and grasses were intermediate to pure stands. A single factor sensitivity analysis of parameters used to calculate P uptake for each cover type indicated that Imax , k, r0, and L0 were consistently the most responsive to changes ranging from −50% to +100%. Model exploration of P uptake as a function of soil depth interval indicated that uptake was highest in the 0–30 cm intervals, with values ranging from 85% of total for cottonwood to 56% for switchgrass.

AB  - Vegetative buffers have been shown to reduce nutrient loss associated with the transport of detached soil particles and may through plant uptake offer a means to capture dissolved nutrients moving to surface waters through the soil solution. The objective of this 4-year study was to evaluate changes in the biomass and P content of the roots and shoots of plants growing in a multi-species versus a single species riparian buffer as an index of P capture potential. Periodic harvests of above ground vegetation were combined with root cores to estimate the total standing biomass and the pool of P in plant tissue in three vegetative cover types dominated by either switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-smooth bromegrass (Bromis inermis Leyss) mix, or a fast growing superior cottonwood (Populus deltoids Bartr., clone 42-7). An existing stand of smooth brome served as the single species control. Standing biomass increased in all three cover types during the 4 years of study, with the greatest increases observed in the cottonwood (2345 g m-²) and switchgrass (1818 g m-²). Biomass production in the smooth brome control did not change during the study period. Based on the 4th-year samples, standing pools of P closely paralleled total plant biomass and root surface area with cottonwood accumulating the greatest amount of P at 19.4 g m-² compared to 4.3 g m-² for the smooth brome control. Estimates of potential P export via biomass harvest from a mixed buffer over a 4-year interval were 101 kg ha-¹ compared to 62 kg ha-¹ for the smooth brome control; a 63% increase in export capacity due largely to the inclusion of cottonwood. Addition of a fast growing woody species combined with periodic biomass harvests has the potential to reduce P movement to surface waters.

AB  - While water quality functions of conservation buffers established adjacent to cropped fields have been widely documented, the relative contribution of these re-established perennial plant systems to greenhouse gases has not been completely documented. In the case of methane (CH4), these systems have the potential to serve as sinks of CH4 or may provide favorable conditions for CH4 production. This study quantifies CH4 flux from soils of riparian buffer systems comprised of three vegetation types and compares these fluxes with those of adjacent crop fields. We measured soil properties and diel and seasonal variations of CH4 flux in 7 to 17 yr-old re-established riparian forest buffers, warm-season and cool-season grass filters, and an adjacent crop field located in the Bear Creek watershed in central Iowa. Forest buffer and grass filter soils had significantly lower bulk density (P < 0.01); and higher pH (P < 0.01), total carbon (TC) (P < 0.01), and total nitrogen (TN) (P < 0.01) than crop field soils. There was no significant relationship between CH4 flux and soil moisture or soil temperature among sites within the range of conditions observed. Cumulative CH4 flux was –0.80 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 in the cropped field, –0.46 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 within the forest buffers, and 0.04 kg CH4–C ha–1 yr–1 within grass filters, but difference among vegetation covers was not significant. Results suggest that CH4 flux was not changed after establishment of perennial vegetation on cropped soils, despite significant changes in soil properties.

AB  - The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS) and its cooperators to design and evaluate the efficiency of riparian buffer ecosystems for nonpoint source pollution reduction. REMM requires numerous inputs to simulate water movement, sediment transport, and nutrient cycling in the buffer system. In order to identify critical model inputs and their uncertainties, a univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted for nine REMM output variables. The magnitude of each input parameter was changed from -50% to +50% from the baseline data in 12 intervals or, in some cases, the complete range of an input was tested. Baseline model inputs for the sensitivity analysis were taken from Gibbs Farm, Georgia, where REMM was tested using a 5-year field dataset. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that REMM responses were most sensitive to weather inputs, with minimum daily temperature having the greatest impact on the nitrogen-related outputs. For example, the 100% change (-50% to +50%) in minimum daily temperature input values yielded a 164.4% change in total nitrogen (N), a 109.3% change in total nitrate (NO3), and a 127.1% change in denitrification. REMM was most sensitive to precipitation with regard to total flow leaving the riparian vegetative buffer zone (199.8%) and sediment yield (138.2%). Deep seepage (12.2%), volumetric water content (24.8%), and pore size index (6.5%) in the buffer soil profile were the most influential inputs for the output water movement. Sediment yield was most sensitive to Manning's coefficient (46.6%), bare soil percent (40.7%), and soil permeability (6.1%). For vegetation, specific leaf area, growing degree day coefficients, and maximum root depth influenced the nitrogen related outputs. Overall results suggest that because of the high sensitivity to weather parameters, on-site weather data is needed for model calibration and validation. The model's relatively low sensitivity to vegetation parameters also appears to support the use of regional vegetation datasets that would simplify model implementation without compromising results.

AB  - Tree species identification is important for a variety of natural resource management and monitoring activities including riparian buffer characterization, wildfire risk assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and wildlife habitat assessment. Intensity data recorded for each laser point in a LIDAR system is related to the spectral reflectance of the target material and thus may be useful for differentiating materials and ultimately tree species. The aim of this study is to test if LIDAR intensity data can be used to differentiate tree species. Leaf-off and leaf-on LIDAR data were obtained in the Washington Park Arboretum, Seattle, Washington, USA. Field work was conducted to measure tree locations, tree species and heights, crown base heights, and crown diameters of individual trees for eight broadleaved species and seven coniferous species. LIDAR points from individual trees were identified using the field-measured tree location. Points from adjacent trees within a crown were excluded using a procedure to separate crown overlap. Mean intensity values of laser returns within individual tree crowns were compared between species. We found that the intensity values for different species were related not only to reflective properties of the vegetation, but also to a presence or absence of foliage and the arrangement of foliage and branches within individual tree crowns. The classification results for broadleaved and coniferous species using linear discriminant function with a cross validation suggests that the classification rate was higher using leaf-off data (83.4%) than using leaf-on data (73.1%), with highest (90.6%) when combining these two LIDAR data sets. The result also indicates that different ranges of intensity values between two LIDAR datasets didn't affect the result of discriminant functions. Overall results indicate that some species and species groups can be differentiated using LIDAR intensity data and implies the potential of combining two LIDAR datasets for one study.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest have become increasingly patchy, dominated by early successional forests. Several amphibian species associated with forested headwater systems have emerged as management concerns, especially after clearcutting. Given that headwater streams comprise a large portion of the length of flowing waterways in western Oregon forests, there is a need to better understand how forest management affects headwater forest taxa and their habitats. Mitigation strategies include alternatives to clearcutting, such as harvests that remove only part of the canopy and maintenance of riparian buffer strips. Our study investigates effects of upland forest thinning coupled with riparian buffer treatments on riparian and upland headwater forest amphibians, habitat attributes, and species-habitat associations. Amphibian captures and habitat variables were examined 5-6 years post-thinning within forest stands subject to streamside-retention buffers and variable-width buffers, as well as unthinned reference stands. We found no treatments effects, however, our results suggest that ground surface conditions (e.g., amount of rocky or fine substrate) play a role in determining the response of riparian and upland amphibians to forest thinning along headwater streams. Distance from stream was associated with amphibian abundance, hence retention of riparian buffers is likely important in maintaining microclimates and microhabitats needed for amphibians and other taxa. Moderate thinning and preservation of conditions in riparian and nearby upland areas by way of variable-width and streamside-retention buffers may be sufficient to maintain suitable habitat and microclimatic conditions vital to amphibian assemblages in managed headwater forests.

AB  - There is little understanding about the role eastern US forested headwater riparian areas play in protecting aquatic habitats and water quality from impacts of side slope forest harvest. To better understand this important riparian area function, we selected three sites from management units with a 2-age regeneration silvicultural prescription located on the Nantahala National Forest, North Carolina, USA. Each site was harvested and a riparian buffer was left uncut along the stream. Buffer widths were 10m and 30m; we included a 0m buffer to experimentally determine nutrient and riparian zone responses to forest cutting under extreme conditions. A fourth site was selected to serve as an uncut reference. Transects were established perpendicular to a 200m stream reach, from streamside to 50m upslope for intensive study. Forest cutting increased extractable NO₃ ⁻ at both 0-10cm and 10-30cm soil depths compared to pre-treatment concentrations. Soil solution NO₃ ⁻ concentrations increased only in harvested areas, on all sites; increases were greater in sites with narrow riparian buffers. Stream water NO₃ ⁻ concentration increased significantly following site harvest only on the 0m buffer site. Dissolved organic C and N did not respond to harvesting in either soil solution or stream samples. Our results suggest that riparian buffers are effective in removing NO₃ ⁻ from soil solution prior to its entering the stream.

AB  - Although seasonal ponds are common in northern, glaciated, forested landscapes, forest management guidelines are generally lacking for these systems. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of riparian buffer type on seasonal pond hydrology following harvest of the adjacent upland forest. A replicated block design consisting of four buffer treatments was established in north central Minnesota in 2000. Treatments included an uncut control (i.e., the upland and buffer were uncut) and three treatments in which the upland was clearcut but the buffer was either uncut, partially harvested, or clearcut. Hydrologic characteristics were examined for differences among buffer treatments. One year of pre-harvest data was collected followed by five years of post-harvest data. Regression analysis of water levels indicated that all buffer treatments had significantly higher pond water depth than the uncut control for four years following harvests. The fifth year following harvests showed no difference in water depth between buffer treatments and the uncut control. In the first post-treatment year, the clearcut buffer treatment had the highest mean annual water depth of the three buffer treatments. Changes in evapotranspiration and runoff due to altering upland and riparian vegetation are considered key factors in explaining these hydrological responses. The results of this study indicate that upland harvesting increases water tables in seasonal ponds, and it takes about five years before water tables are similar to predisturbance levels. Our results also suggest that the amount of vegetation harvested within a riparian buffer affects the hydrologic response, especially in the first year following harvest.

AB  - Riparian forests often have a more diverse tree species composition and more woody debris than neighboring upland forests, but little is known about their importance for the conservation of deadwood-dependent species. We studied the forest characteristics and the diversity of wood fungi (poroid Aphyllophorales) in lakeside riparian (flat and sloping topography) and upland boreal forests in eastern Finland. Riparian forests had a higher density of broadleaved trees and broadleaved debris than did upland forests. A total of 48 species of wood fungi were recorded, including eight red-listed or old-growth forest indicator species. Overall, more species and records and greater diversity were observed in the flat riparian sites than in the sloped riparian and upland sites. The mean species richness did not differ significantly among site categories, indicating greater β diversity among the flat riparian sites. Species composition was more similar between the two riparian categories than between the riparian and upland sites. Riparian sites also hosted more fungal species associated with broadleaved trees. The results show that riparian forests support the diversity of wood fungi in managed boreal forests. Diversity of deadwood-dependent organisms can be promoted by leaving wider and completely unharvested riparian buffer zones.

AB  - Fine sediment accumulation was measured in streams in low-order forest watersheds across a gradient of selective harvesting with no protective riparian buffers. Comparisons were made among sites in selection-cut (40% canopy removal), shelterwood-cut (50% canopy removal), diameter limit cut (about 85% canopy removal), and undisturbed tolerant hardwood catchments. These were further compared with a headwater stream catchment not harvested but affected by logging road activities. The greatest increases in fine inorganic sediment occurred at the road-improvement site with mean bedload estimates more than 4000 times higher than pre-manipulation values. Sediment bedload was still significantly elevated 2 years after the road-improvement activities. Significant increases (up to 1900 times the pre-harvest average) in inorganic sediment also occurred at the highly disturbed diameter-limit site as a result of heavy ground disturbance and channeled flowpaths from skidder activity in riparian areas. Similar increases were detected at the selection-cut site but were attributable to secondary road construction in the runoff area. In the shelterwood harvest area, where logging roads were not a factor, no measurable increases in sediment deposition were detected. There was little indication that harvesting activities at any site affected the organic fraction or the particle size distribution of fine sediments. The results of this study suggest that riparian buffer zones may not be necessary for selective harvesting in hardwood forests at up to 50% removal, at least in terms of reducing sediment inputs.

AB  - The composition and structure of vegetation within riparian buffers prior to, and immediately post-harvesting in a managed radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) forest is described and compared with riparian buffers in residual adjoining native forest on the Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. One hundred and twenty-one species (71% native) representing life forms from grasses to trees were recorded. The highest species richness, including both native and adventive (non-native) species, was found in riparian buffers in the post-harvest and native reference sites which had 18-25 species per site. Riparian buffers in mature pine plantations contained a mix of native species that was generally similar to, and not significantly reduced in species richness, from the reference native forest. Native species comprised 82-92% of the total cover in mature pre-harvest sites (irrespective of riparian width), and 99.8% in native reference sites. Compared with native forest the principal difference was a reduction of total cover in the upper tiers (5-12m), and some increase in cover in the lower tiers. Adventive species in post-harvest sites comprised 16-67% of the total cover and were most frequently found in riparian areas highly disturbed by recent harvesting of the pines, particularly where riparian buffers were narrow or absent. Invasion by light-demanding adventives is expected to be temporary and most species are likely to be shaded out as the new rotation of pine trees develops. Radiata pine plantations in Whangapoua Forest can provide suitable conditions for the development of riparian buffer zones that will become dominated by native species, similar in richness and structure to neighbouring native forest.

AB  - Stream restoration is often employed in efforts to stabilize eroding channel banks. Banks are stabilized through a designed channel approach, which involves grading and armoring of stream banks using heavy machinery, or alternatively through planting of seedlings and saplings to establish forested riparian buffers. We hypothesized that designed channel restoration would have detrimental impacts on riparian soils but that soils would recover over time, and we hypothesized that riparian buffer restoration would not impact riparian soils. We tested these hypotheses by comparing soil attributes (bulk density, soil organic matter, and root biomass) at reaches that had undergone designed channel and riparian buffer restoration in different years (project ages ranged from 2 to 16 years) to paired urban (unrestored) control reaches. Soil properties in sub‐surface soil layers (10–20 and 20–30 cm depth) at both recent (<10 years old) and older (>10 years old) designed channel reaches differed significantly from paired urban control soils; bulk density was higher and root biomass lower in manipulated reaches compared to urban control reaches. At many designed channel reaches, bulk density exceeded values known to restrict root growth. These results indicate that compaction and disturbance of riparian soils may be a significant unintended consequence of designed channel restoration and can persist for at least a decade. In contrast, we found no significant differences in soil properties between riparian buffer restoration reaches and urban control reaches. Thus, the results indicate that riparian buffer restoration is a more ecologically favorable method than designed channel restoration for bank stabilization.

AB  - Land use change has a major impact on goods and services that our environment supplies for society. While detailed ecological or biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the example of the historic development (1964–2004) in the district of Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii) pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced with a maximum land use change of 11% in the major land use classes between 1964 and 2004, we see a decrease of ecosystem function indicators up to 23%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004 without reaching the level of 1964.

AB  - Data from a paired-catchment study in south coastal British Columbia, Canada, were analyzed to assess the thermal effects of clearcut harvesting with no riparian buffer on a fish-bearing headwater stream. The approach used time series of daily mean water temperatures for East Creek (control) and A Creek (treatment), both before and after harvest. Statistical models were developed to predict (a) what the temperatures would have been in the post-harvest period had harvesting not occurred, and (b) what temperatures would have been in the pre-harvest period had harvesting already occurred. The Wisconsin Bioenergetics Model was used to simulate growth of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) for the first year following fry emergence using the predicted and observed stream temperatures to generate scenarios representing with-harvest and no-harvest thermal regimes. A Monte Carlo approach was used to quantify the effects of uncertainty associated with the regression models on predicted stream temperature and trout growth. Summer daily mean temperatures in the with-harvest scenario were up to [Formula: see text] higher than those for the no-harvest scenario. Harvesting-induced warming reduced growth rates during summer, but increased growth rates during autumn and spring. In the with-harvest scenario, trout were 0.2–2.0 g (absolute weight) smaller throughout the winter period than in the no-harvest scenario. However, the bioenergetic simulations suggest that trout growth may be more sensitive to potential changes in food supply following harvesting than to direct impacts of stream temperature changes.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the ability of a multispecies riparian buffer (MRB) to remove sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus from cropland runoff. Simulated rainfall was applied to 4.1- by 22.1-m bare cropland source areas paired with either no buffer, a 7.1-m-wide switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. cv. Cave-n-Rock) buffer, or a 16.3-m-wide switchgrass-woody plant buffer. Each treatment plot combination had three replicates. The switchgrass buffer trapped 70% of the incoming sediment, while the switchgrass-woody buffer trapped more than 92%. In general, these buffers retained 93% of sand and silt particles and 52% of clay particles. During a 2-h rainfall simulation at 25 mm h(-1), the switchgrass buffer removed 64, 61, 72, and 44% of the incoming total N, NO3-N, total P, and PO4-P, respectively. The switchgrass-woody buffer removed 80, 92, 93, and 85% of the incoming total N, NO3-N, total P, and PO4-P, respectively. During a 1-h rainfall simulation at 69 mm h(-1), the switchgrass buffer removed 50, 41, 46, and 28% of the incoming total N, NO3-N, total P, and PO4-P, respectively. The switchgrass-woody plant buffer removed 73, 68, 81, and 35% of the incoming total N, NO3-N, total P, and PO4-P, respectively. The switchgrass buffer was effective in trapping coarse sediment and sediment-bound nutrients. But the additional buffer width with high infiltration capacity provided by the deep-rooted woody plant zone was effective in trapping the clay and soluble nutrients.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a process-based, watershed-scale model with a hydrologic response unit (HRU) as the basic computation element, which makes it difficult to accurately represent riparian buffers using their physical parameters (e.g., vegetation structure). On the other hand, the field-scale Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) provides the opportunity to consider details of hydrologic processes within a riparian buffer zone. However, the runoff and its associated constituents from the upland area that is hydraulically connected to the riparian buffer zone must be provided as inputs into REMM. The rationale proposed here is that the integration of SWAT and REMM would improve the assessment of riparian buffers, which is vital to watershed management but which has not been described in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop a GIS interface that integrated SWAT and REMM for estimating water quality benefits of riparian buffers in agricultural watersheds. For modeling purposes, the interface subdivided a watershed into a number of sub-basins, each of which was further subdivided into drainage areas of isolated impoundments (e.g., wetlands), concentrated flow, and riparian buffers using available GIS data. As a result, riparian buffers received runoff and associated pollutants from corresponding contribution areas to mimic actual field conditions. The interface facilitated transferring the SWAT outputs into REMM and computing the site characteristic parameters (e.g., length and width) of the riparian buffers. The outputs from subsequent REMM runs were in turn taken as inputs into SWAT for channel routing and further simulation. The interface was used to assess water quality benefits of riparian buffers in the Lower Canagagigue Creek watershed located in southern Ontario, Canada. The results indicated that the existing riparian buffer system achieved a 27.9% abatement in sediment and a 37.4% reduction in total phosphorus. The model runs demonstrated that the GIS interface was easy to use and could serve as a protocol for integrating models with distinctly different spatial scales.

AB  - Planted forests are often considered to consist of tree plantings at a scale large enough to satisfy such objectives as commercial production of timber and fiber, protection of watersheds, and preservation of natural habitats. However, trees are planted also at greatly reduced scales in agroforestry systems or as community woodlots to provide a mixture of products and services to resident households, local communities, and regional cultures. Agroforestry systems represent a major form of small-scale tree planting, where trees are grown in purposeful combinations with agricultural crops and/or livestock in order to take advantage of tree-crop interactions, and thereby enhance crop production, diversify farm out-put, stabilize or improve soils, or ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. Some important examples of these systems in tropical countries include homegardens, alley cropping, improved fallows, intercropped trees for shade and fodder production, and trees planted in hedgerows and along fence lines. Throughout the tropics, there is a large variety of indigenous practices and species mixtures that represent adaptations of these systems to meet localized needs and opportunities. Research and development programs have supported the expansion and refinement of many of these systems during the last 20 years, but substantial constraints on tree planting still exist in the form of land-tenure practices, population pressures that relegate agroforestry practices to degraded lands, subsistence needs that prevent extended periods of tree growth, and insufficient technical information or technology dissemination. Agroforestry systems in temperate, industrialized countries include combinations of trees, pasture, and livestock; fruit or nut trees interplanted with vegetable or grain crops; windbreaks and shelterbelts; multispecies riparian buffer strips; and forest farming systems for specialty crops. Compared to the tropics, however, temperate-zone systems tend to focus on one or two high-value crops, often involve some level of mechanization, and frequently represent an opportunistic approach to improving the economic profitability of farms rather than meeting subsistence needs. In both tropical and temperate regions, agroforestry systems and community woodlots will be an important component of new sustainable agriculture and environmental protection programs. Although species diversity is an essential feature of all agroforestry systems, community forests generally involve planting only a few species in small woodlots near farms, around villages, along roads, and as riparian buffers. Provincial or state governments and the local populace are often involved in landownership and plantation establishment. Major objectives of these forests are production of fuelwood for local consumption and of other tree products for market; soil stabilization, reclamation, or improvement; and protection of water quality. As with many other planted forests, the number of species widely used in community forests has been relatively small, with the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus, and Acacia providing the bulk of the species. Major issues with these 'planted forests' focus on rights for use of the products, tending responsibilities since trees are established, protection until trees are large enough for their designated use, increasing interest in using "native" species, and greater community involvement in planning and management. Trees planted along streets and waterways, or as woodlots in parks and other public places, represented a major group of planted forests in many urban and periurban landscapes. In addition providing of the same environmental services that agroforests and community forests do, these urban plantings have unique aesthetic and recreational value. For much of the world's ever-increasing urban population, these may be the only tangible reference points for understanding planted forests. These relatively little-recognized forms of planted forests-planted trees, to be more appropriate--are now receiving much greater attention. There are, however, some serious technical and sociopolitico-institutional constraints to their development as more widely adopted systems in both tropical and temperate regions.

AB  - 1. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of riparian buffers in the tropics, despite their potential to reduce the impacts of deforestation on stream communities. We examined macroinvertebrate assemblages and stream habitat characteristics in small lowland streams in southeastern Costa Rica to assess the impacts of deforestation on benthic communities and the influence of riparian forest buffers on these effects. Three different stream reach types were compared in the study: (i) forested reference reaches, (ii) stream reaches adjacent to pasture with a riparian forest buffer at least 15 m in width on both banks and (iii) stream reaches adjacent to pasture without a riparian forest buffer. 2. Comparisons between forest and pasture reaches suggest that deforestation, even at a very local scale, can alter the taxonomic composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, reduce macroinvertebrate diversity and eliminate the most sensitive taxa. The presence of a riparian forest buffer appeared to significantly reduce the effects of deforestation on benthic communities, as macroinvertebrate diversity and assemblage structure in forest buffer reaches were generally very similar to those in forested reference reaches. One forest buffer reach was clearly an exception to this pattern, despite the presence of a wide riparian buffer. 3. The taxonomic structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages differed between pool and riffle habitats, but contrasts among the three reach types in our study were consistent across the two habitats. Differences among reach types also persisted across three sampling periods during our 15-month study. 4. Among the environmental variables we measured, only stream water temperature varied significantly among reach types, but trends in periphyton abundance and stream sedimentation may have contributed to observed differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. 5. Forest cover was high in all of our study catchments, and more research is needed to determine whether riparian forest buffers will sustain similar functions in more extensively deforested landscapes. Nevertheless, our results provide support for Costa Rican regulations protecting riparian forests and suggest that proper riparian management could significantly reduce the impacts of deforestation on benthic communities in tropical streams.

AB  - Managed riparian forest buffers are an important conservation practice but there are little data on the water quality effects of buffer management. We measured surface runoff volumes and nutrient concentrations and loads in a riparian buffer system consisting of (moving down slope from the field) a grass strip, a managed forest, and an unmanaged forest. The managed forest consisted of sections of clear-cut, thinned, and mature forest. The mature forest had significantly lower flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), sediment TKN, total N (nitrate + TKN), dissolved molybdate reactive P (DMRP), total P, and chloride. The average buffer represented the conditions along a stream reach with a buffer system in different stages of growth. Compared with the field output, flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, DMRP, and total P decreased significantly within the buffer and flow-weighted concentrations of TKN, total N, and chloride increased significantly within the buffer. All loads decreased significantly from the field to the middle of the buffer, but most loads increased from the middle of the buffer to the sampling point nearest the stream because surface runoff volume increased near the stream. The largest percentage reduction of the incoming nutrient load (at least 65% for all nutrient forms) took place in the grass buffer zone because of the large decrease (68%) in flow. The average buffer reduced loadings for all nutrient species, from 27% for TKN to 63% for sediment P. The managed forest and grass buffer combined was an effective buffer system.

AB  - Large-scale restoration of streams and rivers is a mandatory prerequisite for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) to reach good ecological status of water bodies. This contribution analyzes the success of the largest river restoration in Germany at the Upper Main. Sections with a length of more than 18km were restored between 1990 and 2008, including re-connection of former oxbow-lakes, multiple-channelling, and establishment of wide riparian buffer zones. Measuring the success of restoration by means of a multimetric assessment system, we found a clear success of restoration indicated by the status of hydromorphology and by the biological parameters, including macroinvertebrates, fishes, and macrophytes. Unlike non-restored reaches, the restored reaches attained a good ecological status. As such, the restoration of the Upper Main is shown to be a pilot project for the implementation of the WFD on a large scale.

AB  - Stream temperature impacts resulting from forest harvesting in riparian areas have been documented in a number of locations in North America. As part of the Stuart-Takla Fisheries-Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.

AB  - Riparian buffer forests and vegetative filter strips are widely recommended for improving surface water quality, but grass-shrub riparian buffer system (RBSs) are less well studied. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of buffer width and vegetation type on the key processes and overall reductions of total suspended solids (TSS), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) from simulated runoff passed through established (7-year old) RBSs. Nine 1-m RBS plots, with three replicates of three vegetation types (all natural selection grasses, two-segment buffer with native grasses and plum shrub, and two-segment buffer with natural selection grasses and plum shrub) and widths ranging from 8.3 to 16.1 m, received simulated runoff having 4,433 mg/l TSS from on-site soil, 1.6 mg/l total P, and 20 mg/l total N. Flow-weighted samples were collected by using Runoff Sampling System (ROSS) units. The buffers were very efficient in removal of sediments, N, and P, with removal efficiencies strongly linked to infiltration. Mass and concentration reductions averaged 99.7% and 97.9% for TSS, 91.8% and 42.9% for total P, and 92.1% and 44.4% for total N. Infiltration alone could account for >75% of TSS removal, >90% of total P removal, and >90% of total N removal. Vegetation type induced significant differences in removal of TSS, total P, and total N. These results demonstrate that adequately designed and implemented grass-shrub buffers with widths of only 8 m provide for water quality improvement, particularly if adequate infiltration is achieved.

AB  - A new theoretical and experimental framework that permits an accurate determination of aggregate-size stability distribution is presented. The size-stability distribution in addition to estimating aggregate-size distribution distinguishes between amounts of stable and unstable macroaggregates (>250 micrometer). The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized in terms of their size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates >250 micrometer in size. We also propose the stable aggregates index (SAI) and the stable macroaggregates index (SMaI) for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking. These indices account for the total weighted average of stable aggregates and the total weighted average of stable macroaggregates, respectively. Both the SAI and the SMaI indices were shown to be sensitive to the effects of vegetation on soil stability under different riparian buffer communities. The SAI and the SMaI indices were higher in surface soils under cool-season grass than any of the other treatments. These soils samples are well aggregated with SAI = 74% and SMaI = 56% followed by SAI = 55% and SMaI = 37% under existing riparian forest, SAI = 40% and SMaI = 21% under 7-yr switchgrass and SAI =

AB  - Riparian buffers, the vegetated region adjacent to streams and wetlands, are thought to be effective at intercepting and reducing nitrogen loads entering water bodies. Riparian buffer width is thought to be positively related to nitrogen removal effectiveness by influencing nitrogen retention or removal. We surveyed the scientific literature containing data on riparian buffers and nitrogen concentration in streams and groundwater to identify trends between nitrogen removal effectiveness and buffer width, hydrological flow path, and vegetative cover. Nitrogen removal effectiveness varied widely. Wide buffers (>50 m) more consistently removed significant portions of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers (0-25 m). Buffers of various vegetation types were equally effective at removing nitrogen but buffers composed of herbaceous and forest/herbaceous vegetation were more effective when wider. Subsurface removal of nitrogen was efficient, but did not appear to be related to buffer width, while surface removal of nitrogen was partly related to buffer width. The mass of nitrate nitrogen removed per unit length of buffer did not differ by buffer width, flow path, or buffer vegetation type. Our meta-analysis suggests that buffer width is an important consideration in managing nitrogen in watersheds. However, the inconsistent effects of buffer width and vegetation on nitrogen removal suggest that soil type, subsurface hydrology (e.g., soil saturation, groundwater flow paths), and subsurface biogeochemistry (organic carbon supply, nitrate inputs) also are important factors governing nitrogen removal in buffers.

AB  - Movement of agricultural nitrogen (N) into riparian buffers often occurs within discrete seepage or upwelling zones which can limit the ability of the ecosystem to process the nutrient delivered by exfiltrating groundwater. Characterization of the biogeochemical processing of N within these zones is important in assessing the effectiveness of riparian buffers for mitigating nutrient loading of surface waters. The biogeochemical potential for denitrification in zones of exfiltration within a riparian buffer wetland dominated by high-carbon mucky soils was found to be highly stratified by profile depth with substantially higher activity in the surface layer of soil. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) within these zones was partly related to the population size of denitrifying microorganisms as measured by the most probable number (MPN) as well as the general microbial population as measured by substrate-induced respiration. The addition of glucose to the DEA assay stimulated enzyme activity indicating that carbon substrate was limiting activity. The stratification patterns of microbial populations and DEA are consistent with new carbon inputs to the ecosystem being most important driver of biogeochemical reactions such as denitrification in this high-carbon environment. A survey of carbon inputs to the ecosystem under study identified two major sources that contribute most of the annual biomass carbon inputs to the wetland: skunk cabbage in early summer and tree leaf litter in the fall. Tests of the ability of annually deposited wetland plant residues to stimulate denitrification and microbial respiration indicated that the degree of stimulation was inversely related to the C/N ratio of these carbon sources.

AB  - The intensity of management of lowland grassland fields in the United Kingdom, coupled with the fact that such grasslands dominate much of the lowland landscape, means that there are now few opportunities for many plants, invertebrates, birds, or mammals to survive. The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) has investigated whether fencing off the margins of such fields next to watercourses to control diffuse pollution has any positive impacts on biodiversity, based on assessments of vegetation composition and condition and structure of assemblages of invertebrates of importance as foodstuffs to farmland birds. Fencing watercourses increased the abundance of key groups of invertebrates. However, the invertebrate species diversity was not increased unless the margins were ≥5.4 m in width. Margins established in the study area to prevent access by livestock to watercourses or to enhance biodiversity are generally ≤2.6 m wide and are therefore unlikely to provide conditions for additional invertebrate species to use. The dense, tall swards within such margins are also unlikely to provide foraging opportunities for farmland birds. Management (such as low-intensity grazing by livestock in the margins) is essential to provide the conditions required for these groups, but this could conflict with the diffuse pollution mitigation aims. A compromise is proposed whereby limited autumn/winter grazing by livestock could be used to open the vegetation structure in the margins. Grazing by livestock at that time may be acceptable since it is not occurring in the period of main diffuse pollution concern (i.e., the fecal contamination of watercourses and bathing waters in the spring and summer). It is also essential that a landscape-scale approach is taken, driven by knowledge of the full needs of the species concerned, when deciding where best to target agri-environmental actions aimed at farmland bird conservation.

AB  - Cost-effective nonpoint source phosphorus (P) control should target the land areas at greatest risk for P loss. We combined mass-balance modeling and geographic analysis to identify and map high-risk areas for P export by integrating long-term P input/output accounting with spatially variable physiographic, land use, and agronomic factors. The dynamic interactive simulation of phosphorus loss areas (DISPLA) model evaluates changes over time and space in soil P concentration and P export in response to management interventions targeted specifically to critical P source areas. Five scenarios were simulated in a test watershed dominated by dairy agriculture in Vermont's Champlain Valley: (1) baseline; (2) nutrient management applied to corn and hay land and to urban lawns; (3) erosion control applied to silage corn land; (4) conversion of critically eroding cropland to permanent grass; and (5) all management changes combined. If present-day conditions continue, soil test P and P export will inevitably increase as P inputs continue to exceed outputs. Soil test P levels on corn land are projected to increase more than fourfold over 80 years if present management continues; estimated P export is expected to more than double over the same period. Increases in soil test P over time in the watershed are not uniform, but varied spatially in response to variability in initial conditions and input/output P balance. Targeted nutrient management was effective in reducing soil test P concentrations (50-90%) and appeared to hold the line on P export for the test watershed over the 80-year simulation. Simulated P export in the test watershed at the end of the nutrient management simulation was reduced by 64% compared to baseline. Implementation of erosion control on row cropland had little effect on soil test P and achieved only a transitory reduction in P export. Exclusive reliance on cropland erosion control to manage nonpoint source P is unlikely to succeed over the long term. Conversion of critical row cropland to permanent grass reduced P export by 54%, but did not affect soil P levels. Because row cropland converted to grassland retains its soil test P concentration, management of converted grassland to reduce runoff and P export is very important; row cropland with elevated soil test P converted to riparian buffer may still serve as a source of dissolved P to runoff. Application of all management measures combined yielded a 74% reduction in P export. Implications to watershed P management are discussed.

AB  - There are uncertainties in the definition of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) transfer pathways within agricultural river catchments due to spatiotemporal variations such as water recharge and the farming calendar, or catchment soil and hydrogeological properties. This can have implications for mitigation policies. This study combined detailed pathway studies with catchment integrated studies to characterise N and P transfer pathways for four agricultural catchments with different land management, soil drainage and geology. A Loadograph Recession Analysis (LRA) method is introduced, to identify and quantify integrated delivery transfer pathways of total oxidised nitrogen (TON), total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and total phosphorus (TP). High temporal resolution river discharge and water quality measurements from a large runoff event (and recession) were used. In two catchments with well drained soils, below-ground delivery pathways of TON represented up to 97% of the total flow event load, and up to 63% of the TRP and TP load. In these catchments, hydrological quick flow pathways were only 2–8% of total flow but were efficient in delivering P (up to 50%). Two other catchments had poor to moderately drained soils where up to 55% of the hydrological pathways were quick flow. This quick flow delivered up to 88% of the event flow P load but background groundwater flows were apparently mixed with point source signals. Results suggest that, in catchments with permeable soils and geology, subsurface pathways will need to be considered for mitigation strategies for both diffuse N and P delivery and measures that target surface transfer pathways such as riparian buffer strips may be ineffective. In such catchments, long chemical recessions from storm events may prolong impacts on the ecological status of receiving rivers.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the water quality benefits provided by a buffer enrolled in the North Carolina Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (NC CREP). A 5-year study was conducted on two distinct buffer sections along the same stream to evaluate the hydrology and attenuation of groundwater nitrate (NO₃ ⁻-N) entering from nearby agricultural fields. The average buffer widths were 60m (Section 1, upstream) and 45m (Section 2, downstream). Three transects of groundwater monitoring well nests within each buffer zone were installed to monitor water quality and water table depths for 5years. Mean groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations at the 1.5m depth decreased from 4.5mgL⁻¹ to 1.7mgL⁻¹ and from 12.9mgL⁻¹ to 1.4mgL⁻¹ in buffer Sections 1 and 2 respectively. These differences were significant in both buffer sections (α=0.05), but the wider Section 1 received significantly less NO₃ ⁻-N than did Section 2 (P<0.0001). Groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N loads were reduced by 0.003kgm⁻²yr⁻¹ (76% reduction) at the 1.5m depth, while in Section 2 these loads were reduced by 0.02kgm⁻²yr⁻¹ (94% reduction) and 0.04kgm⁻²yr⁻¹ (86% reduction) at the 1.5m and 3m depths, respectively. Topography, water table and redox measurements, nitrate to chloride ratios, and deep groundwater cation analyses, indicated both sections were suitable for denitrification to proceed. However, the position of the wider Section 1 buffer in the landscape limited the amount of NO₃ ⁻-N contaminated groundwater that entered from the agricultural fields, and thus could have been designed to be narrower. The effectiveness of NO₃ ⁻-N reduction in riparian buffer systems is dependent on multiple landscape and biogeochemical factors and not buffer width alone. Findings provide design guidance for conservation buffer program managers as related to the influence of buffer landscape position on groundwater nitrate reduction.

AB  - Forested riparian buffers are an increasingly common method of mitigating the negative effects of impervious surface cover on water quality and wildlife habitat. We sampled larval southern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) in 43 streams, representing the range of impervious surface cover and forested riparian buffer width across Wake County, NC, USA. Larval abundance decreased with increasing impervious surface cover in the upstream catchment, but was not affected by buffer width. This is likely a result of an incomplete buffer system and culverts or other breaches along streams. Larval abundance increased with detritus cover in the stream to a threshold and then decreased as detritus continued to increase. As percent pebble substrate in the stream increased, especially in perennial streams, larval salamander abundance also increased. We suspect salamanders were unable to migrate with the water column during dry periods in intermittent streams with sedimented interstices below the surface, resulting in low abundances. A combination of increased peak flows and sedimentation, reduced base flow, and chemical changes likely reduces the abundance of salamanders in urban and suburban streams. We suggest creation of catchment-wide, unbreached buffers to maintain the integrity of stream habitats in urbanizing watersheds.

AB  - Understanding all watershed systems and their interactions is a complex, but critical, undertaking when developing practices designed to reduce topsoil loss and chemical/nutrient transport from agricultural fields. The presence of riparian buffer vegetation in agricultural landscapes can modify the characteristics of overland flow, promoting sediment deposition and nutrient filtering. Watershed simulation tools, such as the USDA-Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution model, typically require detailed information for each riparian buffer zone throughout the watershed describing the location, width, vegetation type, topography, and possible presence of concentrated flow paths through the riparian buffer zone. Research was conducted to develop GIS-based technology designed to spatially characterize riparian buffers and to estimate buffer efficiency in reducing sediment loads in a semiautomated fashion at watershed scale. The methodology combines modeling technology at different scales, at individual concentrated flow paths passing through the riparian zone, and at watershed scales. At the concentrated flow path scale, vegetative filter strip models are applied to estimate the sediment-trapping efficiency for each individual flow path, which are aggregated based on the watershed subdivision and used in the determination of the overall impact of the riparian vegetation at the watershed scale. This GIS-based technology is combined with AnnAGNPS to demonstrate the effect of riparian vegetation on sediment loadings from sheet and rill and ephemeral gully sources. The effects of variability in basic input parameters used to characterize riparian buffers, onto generated outputs at field scale (sediment trapping efficiency) and at watershed scale (sediment loadings from different sources) were evaluated and quantified. The AnnAGNPS riparian buffer component represents an important step in understanding and accounting for the effect of riparian vegetation, existing and/or managed, in reducing sediment loads at the watershed scale.

AB  - Recent changes in Brazilian legislation reduced the width of riparian forest buffer needed to be preserved in private properties from 30 to 15 m or less. The consequences of these modifications can be dramatic, mainly because riparian buffer width is an important parameter for riparian forest structure and functioning. Our study assessed whether (1) macroinvertebrate family richness and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) family richness decrease with reduced riparian buffer width; (2) taxonomic composition and functional feeding group (FFG) composition of macroinvertebrates vary with a reduced riparian buffer width; and (3) reduced riparian buffer width similarly influence the macroinvertebrate community in different stream substrates. We selected three fragments with different riparian buffer widths (>40, <30, and <15 m) in three streams (fourth and fifth orders) in the Sinos River watershed, southern Brazil. Our results show that on all substrate types, reducing the width of the riparian buffer altered neither the macroinvertebrate richness nor EPT richness. However, EPT richness was greater in the substrates stone and gravel than leaf litter, independent of riparian buffer width. There was a significant difference in macroinvertebrate composition among riparian buffer widths. The macroinvertebrate composition and FFG differed among substrates, independent of riparian buffer width. This study showed that riparian buffer widths <15 m altered the macroinvertebrate community. A width greater than 15 m is necessary to maintain the composition and trophic conditions of macroinvertebrate families similar to those found in reference states of conservation.

AB  - Soil erosion occurs with sufficient frequency and severity on arable land in the UK to warrant erosion control measures. The main justification is to decrease the off-farm damages resulting from sedimentation and pollution. The grassing of valley floors, the creation of riparian buffer zones and the use of winter cover crops are recommended as suitable measures. These have additional benefits in terms of wildlife habitats and decrease of nitrate leaching. Financial incentives targeted at farmers in erosion-sensitive areas are proposed as the main method of implementation.

AB  - Riparian buffer system (RBS) effectiveness in reducing nonpoint source pollution from surface runoff can be evaluated by measuring constituent concentrations and flow volumes entering and exiting the system. This article describes the development and precision assessment of a low-cost, low-maintenance surface runoff sampling system (ROSS) in measuring flow volumes and collecting flow-weighted samples. The primary components of ROSS are a solar panel, battery, pump with a float switch, and splitter assembly at a cost of $218 (2001). ROSS delivers the runoff collected in a sump to a V-shaped splitter that separates successive fractions of the total flow using six dividers. Eighteen ROSS units were subjected to lab and field tests to establish calibration and quality control parameters and to determine the allowable maintenance interval. The results indicate ROSS units provide a reasonable precision over time, as indicated by flow volumes being within a 95% confidence interval of expected values for 96% (divider #1), 100% (#2), 96% (#3), 89% (#4), 69% (#5), and 56% (#6) of the units. The mean measured flow volumes by each divider in the lab and in the field were significantly different (alpha = 0.05), suggesting calibration factors are best determined in the field. ROSS units provided runoff samples with the same precision over a 3-month period, demonstrating an ability to maintain calibration over time. The ROSS unit meets the needs of a low-cost, flow-weighted sampler with reasonable accuracy and ease of use and should facilitate more widespread field assessments of RBS constituent-removal effectiveness.

AB  - The implementation of a geodata-based probabilistic pesticide exposure assessment for surface waters in Germany offers the opportunity to base the exposure estimation on more differentiated assumptions including detailed landscape characteristics. Since these characteristics can only be estimated using field surveys, water body width and depth, hydrology, riparian buffer strip width, ground vegetation cover, existence of concentrated flow paths, and riparian vegetation were characterised at 104 water body segments in the vineyard region Palatinate (south-west Germany). Water body segments classified as permanent (n=43) had median values of water body width and depth of 0.9m and 0.06m, respectively, and the determined median width:depth ratio was 15. Thus, the deterministic water body model (width=1m; depth=0.3m) assumed in regulatory exposure assessment seems unsuitable for small water bodies in the study area. Only 25% of investigated buffer strips had a dense vegetation cover (>70%) and allow a laminar sheet flow as required to include them as an effective pesticide runoff reduction landscape characteristic. At 77 buffer strips, bordering field paths and erosion rills leading into the water body were present, concentrating pesticide runoff and consequently decreasing buffer strip efficiency. The vegetation type shrubbery (height>1.5m) was present at 57 (29%) investigated riparian buffer strips. According to their median optical vegetation density of 75%, shrubberies may provide a spray drift reduction of 72±29%. Implementing detailed knowledge in an overall assessment revealed that exposure via drift might be 2.4 and via runoff up to 1.6 fold higher than assumed by the deterministic approach. Furthermore, considering vegetated buffer strips only by their width leads to an underestimation of exposure by a factor of as much as four. Our data highlight that the deterministic model assumptions neither represent worst-case nor median values and therefore cannot simply be adopted in a probabilistic approach.

AB  - We conducted a preliminary examination of the responses of stream amphibians and instream habitat conditions to alternative riparian buffer zones with forest thinning upslope. Pre and posttreatment surveys were carried out on 68 headwater stream reaches (including 23 unthinned reference reaches) at 11 sites in western Oregon. Streams were in managed conifer stands, 40 to 80 years old, where the thinning treatment reduced stands from 600 trees per hectare (tph) to 200 tph. Treatments consisted of four widths of riparian buffers approximately 6, 15, 70, and 145 m on each side of streams. Over three study years, 3,131 individuals of 13 species were detected. For the more common instream and bank species analyzed, capture rates persisted posttreatment with no negative treatment effect from thinning with any of the buffer widths. More animals were detected after thinning in treatment reaches compared to reference reaches for rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa Skilton) occurring on stream banks, and for instream coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus Baird and Girard). Treatment effects on instream habitat parameters were not detected. Interannual variation was evident for western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum Cooper), and several habitat conditions including pool-riffle ratio, stream spatial intermittency, stream width, and down wood. Overall, riparian buffers with moderate upslope thinning (200 tph) seemed to have retained the aquatic vertebrate community along channels among sites in the first 2 years posttreatment; however, several limitations of the study reduce the inference of the findings, and these preliminary results are best interpreted as hypotheses for further investigation.

AB  - This study established for the first time the impact of harvesting on post-harvest papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) biomass regeneration potential, with two harvesting regimes compared. Above-ground papyrus biomass was determined. Biomass varied with site. Site had no effect on regeneration potential, but monthly harvesting reduced papyrus biomass regeneration potential among sites. However, seasonal (6-monthly) harvesting did not appear to affect papyrus biomass regeneration potential. Exponential and polynomial trend analyses revealed a consistent downward trend for monthly harvest biomass, and the polynomial trend was more linear (F = 97.913; P < 0.001) than periodic (F = 9.617; P < 0.05). The polynomial trend scenario indicated how papyrus biological dynamics are likely to behave as monthly harvests are repeated. This suggests that regeneration potential is significantly reduced with successive monthly harvest, leading to weak spatial connectivity, papyrus stand fragmentation, and increased landscape patchiness. A 6-month harvest regime can be established to regenerate more biomass between harvests than is currently the case, with positive implications for wetland conservation and carbon sequestration. Papyrus harvesters can be kept off the swamps by establishing a riparian buffer zone of agro forestry trees and shrubs which can substitute for the papyrus as it is left to mature. However, while the information presented is useful for papyrus wetland management strategies, it is recognized that the study period was too short to permit a generalized recommendation.

AB  - Riparian buffers in agricultural landscapes should be designed to trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough that concentrates overland flow. This study examines the occurrence of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at ten field sites in southern Illinois. To assess the prevalence of CFPs at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys along randomly selected 1,000 m reaches. CFPs were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys. Among field sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82.5–100% of the drainage leaving the agricultural fields. Sediment berm accumulation was identified at all field sites and was positively correlated with CFP size. At the watershed scale, CFPs were more abundant in agricultural areas compared to forested land. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was prevalent across all study sites at both the field and watershed scale. Thus, surface water quality may suffer in areas with poorly functioning buffers, and managers must consider the occurrence of CFPs when designing and maintaining riparian buffers to protect stream water quality.

AB  - The flow of chemical materials along spatial elements is a fundamental aspect of landscape ecology. The research renders indicators for water pollution, which are utile for functional water management and land use planning. Ecologists identify mechanisms of nutrients transfer and mitigate their environmental impacts using freshwater wetlands and riparian buffers. In order to estimate the N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) loss risk, current research combines indicators into index models. The objective of this work was to review the factors of transport from upland source areas to surface water as N and P indicators, and to report on the magnitudes of N and P fluxes in agricultural landscapes under temperate climate. We reviewed the ISI Web of Science for recent developments on N and P transport factors and nutrient index models, and we suggested how to improve these schemes. We presented conceptual diagrams of N and P transport. Catchment-scale index models use factors of contributing distance, connectivity, soil properties, and erosion as indicators. P losses are mainly dependent on overland flow conduits and barriers, whereas subsurface flows control N more. Riparian vegetation accumulates great N and P amounts, while it is usually just a temporary sink. Riparian soil is a smaller but a more permanent store, whereas it may turn to a nutrient sink, too, when saturated. Anaerobic soil microbes denitrify somewhat less N, while this process is irreversible, and therefore equally crucial. In spite of this, most nutrient index models do not consider wetlands and riparian buffers. Hence we suggest to include the removal capacity of the riparian buffer zone in both catchment N and P index models. In general, we propose a landscape framework, which considers upland source areas, transit, and hydric riparian landscape elements as a single system.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity on forest landscapes dominated by plantations has become an increasingly important topic, and opportunities to maintain or enhance biodiversity within these forests need to be recognized and applied. Riparian buffers of mature forest retained along streams in managed forest landscapes offer an opportunity to enhance biodiversity across these landscapes. However, influence of buffer width and structure of adjacent plantations on habitat use by birds is not well understood. We modeled probability of occupancy, while accounting for variable detection probabilities, for 16 bird species of regional conservation importance in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We examined occurrence of breeding birds in streamside management zone (SMZ) buffers embedded in three structural classes of pine plantation: young open-canopy, closed-canopy, and older thinned plantations. Our occupancy models included a positive association with SMZ width for nine bird species associated with mature forests. Models for three early successional species (prairie warbler [Dendroica discolor], white-eyed vireo [Vireo griseus], and northern bobwhite [Colinus virginianus]) included a negative association with SMZ width. Occupancy models for Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), summer tanager (Piranga rubra), pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), prairie warbler, and northern bobwhite also included structural condition of adjacent plantations, but most species did not appear affected by condition of surrounding plantations. We found diverse responses among species to width of retained SMZs and structure of adjacent plantations; some species apparently benefitted from SMZs >100 m wide, while others benefitted from narrow buffers. Furthermore, most species traditionally associated with mature forests were common in narrow SMZs, regardless of width. Thus, optimal width of SMZs relative to avian conservation depends on the species of greatest conservation interest.

AB  - Headwater streams are an important and prevalent feature of the eastern North American landscape. These streams provide a wealth of ecosystem services and support tremendous biological diversity, which is predominated by salamanders in the Appalachian region. Salamanders are ubiquitous throughout the region, contributing a significant biomass that supports ecological and ecosystem processes. One of the greatest threats to salamanders is loss of headwater-riparian habitat through timber harvest. In this study, we measured larval salamander abundance at five headwater streams with different riparian buffer widths retained following logging. By sampling larval salamanders using leaf litter bags, we assessed the impacts of even-aged timber harvest on aquatic larval salamander abundances, where it was found that larvae are negatively impacted by increased stream sedimentation and a decrease in riparian buffer width. We found that retention of a 9-m buffer was effectively no different than complete removal of all riparian forest, and as such, current regulations to protect headwater streams are ineffectual. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the 30m buffer treatment and uncut control treatments suggesting that a 30m or larger riparian buffer may assuage the in-stream effects of riparian timber harvest. Management guidelines for Appalachian forests should be revised to accommodate the biology of plethodontid salamanders.

AB  - A science-based geographic information system (GIS) approach is presented to target critical source areas in watersheds for conservation buffer placement. Critical source areas are the intersection of hydrologically sensitive areas and pollutant source areas in watersheds. Hydrologically sensitive areas are areas that actively generate runoff in the watershed and are derived using a modified topographic index approach based on variable source area hydrology. Pollutant source areas are the areas in watersheds that are actively and intensively used for such activities as agricultural production. The method is applied to the Neshanic River watershed in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The capacity of the topographic index in predicting the spatial pattern of runoff generation and the runoff contribution to stream flow in the watershed is evaluated. A simple cost-effectiveness assessment is conducted to compare the conservation buffer placement scenario based on this GIS method to conventional riparian buffer scenarios for placing conservation buffers in agricultural lands in the watershed. The results show that the topographic index reasonably predicts the runoff generation in the watershed. The GIS-based conservation buffer scenario appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional riparian buffer scenarios.

AB  - Riparian zones can provide a protective buffer between streams and adjacent land-based activities by removing nitrate from shallow groundwater flowing through them. Hydrological factors are an important influence on the effectiveness of riparian buffer zones in reducing pollutant loads delivered to streams. In this paper, we present results from a study of the hydrology of two riparian buffers belonging to an ephemeral and a perennial stream, which are part of a research project to study nitrogen transport and transformation processes in shallow groundwater in South-East Queensland, Australia. The investigation at the ephemeral site has shown that a shallow perched water table forms shortly after stream flow commences as a result of lateral flow from the stream to floodplain; it resides within the carbon-rich root zone and drains off after stream flow ceases. The low head gradient of 1% results in a low flow rate of about 6 cm/day along the floodplain, slow enough to allow effective removal of nitrate via denitrification to occur. The investigation at the perennial site has shown that water table dynamics within the floodplain are dissociated from the up-slope area except during over-bank flood events. During non-event conditions, there is low streamward gradient that results in a base flow component to the stream; the water table depth is about 3.5 m, hence missing most of the carbon-rich soils located close to the soil surface. During flood events, a reverse gradient towards the floodplain is formed; the streamward gradient is re-established after the flood wave passes. The water table fluctuates between 1.8 and 3.5 m under these conditions thus having a higher chance of interacting with more active floodplain sediments. Water stored in the floodplain has a residence time of 2-10 days, providing an opportunity for denitrification to reduce nitrate concentrations prior to water draining back to the stream.

AB  - In this article we compared the response of surface water runoff to a storm event for different rates of urbanization, reforestation and riparian buffer setbacks across forty subwatersheds of the Muskegon River Watershed located in Michigan, USA. We also made these comparisons for several forecasted and one historical land use scenarios (over 140 years). Future land use scenarios to 2040 for forest regrowth, urbanization rates and stream setbacks were developed using the Land Transformation Model (LTM). Historical land use information, from 1900 at 5-year time step intervals, was created using a Backcast land use change model configured using artificial neural network and driven by agriculture and housing census information. We show that (1) controlling the rate of development is the most effective policy option to reduce runoff; (2) establishing setbacks along the mainstem are not as effective as controlling urban growth; (3) reforestation can abate some of the runoff effects from urban growth but not all; (4) land use patterns of the 1970s produced the least amount of runoff in most cases in the Muskegon River Watershed when compared to land use maps from 1900 to 2040; and, (5) future land use patterns here not always lead to increased (worse) runoff than the past. We found that while ten of the subwatersheds contained futures that were worse than any past land use configuration, twenty-five (62.5%) of the subwatersheds produced the greatest amount of runoff in 1900, shortly after the entire watershed was clear-cut. One third (14/40) of the subwatersheds contained the minimum amount of runoff in the 1960s and 1970s, a period when forest amounts were greatest and urban amounts relatively small.

AB  - Arkansas produces the most rice, 3rd most cotton and 2nd most broilers of any state in the US. By 2050, agriculture will be asked to produce twice as much food, feed, and fiber for the projected world population, while challenged with reduced water availability from groundwater decline and increased pumping costs. Associated in part with agriculture, excess nutrients influence local and regional water quality, such as Chesapeake Bay eutrophication and Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. In response to these water resources issues, a network of agricultural edge-of-field monitoring sites was established in 2010 in Arkansas. The network was established in an effort to understand how management impacts water quality and water quantity. The objective of the network is to collect scientifically sound data at field scales under typical and conservation management practices for the region. These management practices in the network includes but is not limited to nutrient management, cover crops, conservation tillage, grassed waterways, riparian buffer, water management including irrigation planning, surface water storage, shallow water development for waterfowl use, water and control structures. Water inputs and outputs are quantified, and water quality including sediment, nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and total) and phosphorus (soluble, particulate, and total) are analyzed. Partners in the creation of this network include Arkansas State University, University of Arkansas, University of Arkansas – Pine Bluff, USDA-ARS, USDA-NRCS, Arkansas Natural Resources Commission, Arkansas Association of Conservation Districts and agricultural producers representing the major commodities of the state of Arkansas. The statewide network is described.

AB  - In this paper, the current knowledge on mitigation strategies to reduce pesticide inputs into surface water and groundwater, and their effectiveness when applied in practice is reviewed. Apart from their effectiveness in reducing pesticide inputs into ground- and surface water, the mitigation measures identified in the literature are evaluated with respect to their practicability. Those measures considered both effective and feasible are recommended for implementing at the farm and catchment scale. Finally, recommendations for modelling are provided using the identified reduction efficiencies. Roughly 180 publications directly dealing with or being somehow related to mitigation of pesticide inputs into water bodies were examined. The effectiveness of grassed buffer strips located at the lower edges of fields has been demonstrated. However, this effectiveness is very variable, and the variability cannot be explained by strip width alone. Riparian buffer strips are most probably much less effective than edge-of-field buffer strips in reducing pesticide runoff and erosion inputs into surface waters. Constructed wetlands are promising tools for mitigating pesticide inputs via runoff/erosion and drift into surface waters, but their effectiveness still has to be demonstrated for weakly and moderately sorbing compounds. Subsurface drains are an effective mitigation measure for pesticide runoff losses from slowly permeable soils with frequent waterlogging. For the pathways drainage and leaching, the only feasible mitigation measures are application rate reduction, product substitution and shift of the application date. There are many possible effective measures of spray drift reduction. While sufficient knowledge exists for suggesting default values for the efficiency of single drift mitigation measures, little information exists on the effect of the drift reduction efficiency of combinations of measures. More research on possible interactions between different drift mitigation measures and the resulting overall drift reduction efficiency is therefore indicated. Point-source inputs can be mitigated against by increasing awareness of the farmers with regard to pesticide handling and application, and encouraging them to implement loss-reducing measures of “best management practice”. In catchments dominated by diffuse inputs at least in some years, mitigation of point-source inputs alone may not be sufficient to reduce pesticide loads/concentrations in water bodies to an acceptable level.

AB  - The distribution and morphological characteristics of channels were mapped in a redwood forest at Caspar Creek, California, USA, to evaluate the extent to which recent logging has influenced channel conditions in the area. In the North Fork Caspar Creek watershed, second-cycle logging of the early 1990s appears to have triggered increased coalescence of discontinuous gullies within clearcut tributary watersheds, and upstream channel limits in logged watersheds are now located significantly farther upslope than in control watersheds. The magnitudes of observed increases in peakflow after logging are consistent with the change in drainage density. Relations between channel morphological variables and indices of stream power are less well-defined in logged watersheds than in controls, suggesting that logging may have led to disruption of previously established channel forms. Correlations between suspended sediment yields and indices of gully erosion suggest that in-channel erosion associated with hydrologic change is an important source of post-logging sediment at Caspar Creek. Common sediment-control measures, such as use of riparian buffer strips and reduction of road surface erosion, would not be effective for reducing sediment input from this source.

AB  - Water pollution in Chinese lakes is a major problem. To reduce nutrient pollution and enhance sustainable development in Taihu Basin, China, an integrated assessment of the impacts of agricultural land use policies has been performed, using the technical coefficient generator TechnoGIN and the bio-economic farm model FSSIM. Results show that although promotion of site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), the first policy, can improve regional objectives such as nutrient pollution reduction and food security, its adoption is constrained by labour productivity and availability at farm level. SSNM is more knowledge and labour intensive than conventional management, whereas labour availability is decreasing due to off-farm employment possibilities. In policy scenarios for 2015, environmental impacts are projected to decrease compared to 2008, partly due to the adoption of SSNM. However, the main reason is the decreasing labour availability towards 2015 which causes a switch from double to single cropping already in the baseline scenario for 2015. This leads to lower food production. Abolishing fertilizer subsidies for farmers that do not adopt SSNM, in combination with training appears to be the best way to stimulate SSNM adoption for improving the different land use functions. A second policy, stimulating mechanical transplanting of rice, reduces labour use and can become profitable when subsidized, but on most farm types it will not reverse the trend towards single cropping and has little influence on nutrient pollution. Thirdly, the regional policy of creating riparian buffer zones along water bodies appears to be promising, as it can strongly reduce nutrient leaching from farm land to rivers and lakes. Concluding, the integrated assessment performed in this study showed that policies can reduce nutrient pollution and improve sustainable development, but the changing labour context has a large impact on their impacts and on agriculture in the region.

AB  - Living and detrital biomass in a riparian buffer zones ameliorate diffuse-source pollution originating from adjacent landscapes, with higher nutrient removal potential, particularly with respect to nitrogen and sediments, associated with more biomass (i.e., older forests). Pollution removal is mediated by sediment trapping and uptake of nitrogen by plants and by denitrification by microbial communities in root zones using organic matter and root exudates as energy sources. However, as a consequence of various land management activities, the amount of biomass of most forest riparian zones is much lower than its potential, which is mature forest. This makes restoration of riparian buffer zones to mature forest an ideal way to both improve water quality and increase carbon sequestration. This study measures the amount of biomass aboveground and in soils for a variety of common, age-related condition-types associated with riparian buffer zones along low order (headwater) streams in agricultural landscapes of Coastal Plain North Carolina. The data are used to determine pollution removal potential in relation to stand age and distance from channel and a basis for developing an indicator of riparian condition. Mean biomass for common riparian cover types were Mature Forest (>50 y old): 483Mg/ha; Young Forest (25–50 y old): 257Mg/ha; Regenerating Forest (5–25 y old): 205Mg/ha; recently Harvested Forest (0–5 y old): 165Mg/ha; Perennial Herb: 67Mg/ha; Shrub/Sapling: 63Mg/ha; and Annual Rowcrop: 36Mg/ha. Trees contained >96% of all aboveground biomass and >58% of total biomass present in the forested conditions. Biomass in recently harvested forests were >97% detrital, mostly due to the large amount of slash left after harvesting and the mostly intact soil organic matter. Most (>80%) of the biomass in non-forest cover types was stored in the detrital pool. By partitioning the riparian zone into inverse distance-weighted subzones based on distance from stream channel, we developed an indicator for determining riparian condition based on both biomass and proximity of biomass to channel.

AB  - This paper proposes a hydrological modeling framework to define achievable performance standards (APSs) for pesticides that could be attained after implementation of recommended management actions, agricultural practices, and available technologies (i.e., beneficial management practices [BMPs]). An integrated hydrological modeling system, Gestion Intégrée des Bassins versants à l'aide d'un Système Informatisé, was used to quantify APSs for six Canadian watersheds for eight pesticides: atrazine, carbofuran, dicamba, glyphosate, MCPB, MCPA, metolachlor, and 2,4-D. Outputs from simulation runs to predict pesticide concentration under current conditions and in response to implementation of two types of beneficial management practices (reduced pesticide application rate and 1- to 10-m-wide edge-of-field and/or riparian buffer strips, implemented singly or in combination) showed that APS values for scenarios with BMPs were less than those for current conditions. Moreover, APS values at the outlet of watersheds were usually less than ecological thresholds of good condition, when available. Upstream river reaches were at greater risk of having concentrations above a given ecological thresholds because of limited stream flows and overland loads of pesticides. Our integrated approach of “hydrological modeling–APS estimation–ecotoxicological significance” provides the most effective interpretation possible, for management and education purposes, of the potential biological impact of predicted pesticide concentrations in rivers.

AB  - We assessed the influence of land cover at multiple spatial extents on fish assemblage integrity, and the degree to which riparian forests can mitigate the negative effects of catchment urbanization on stream fish assemblages. Riparian cover (urban, forest, and agriculture) was determined within 30 m buffers at longitudinal distances of 200 m, 1 km, and the entire network upstream of 59 non-nested fish sampling locations. Catchment and riparian land cover within the upstream network were highly correlated, so we were unable to distinguish between those variables. Most fish assemblage variables were related to % forest and % urban land cover, with the strongest relations at the largest spatial extent of land cover (catchment), followed by riparian land cover in the 1-km and 200-m reach, respectively. For fish variables related to urban land cover in the catchment, we asked whether the influence of riparian land cover on fish assemblages was dependent on the amount of urban development in the catchment. Several fish assemblage metrics (endemic richness, endemic:cosmopolitan abundance, insectivorous cyprinid richness and abundance, and fluvial specialist richness) were all best predicted by single variable models with % urban land cover. However, endemic:cosmopolitan richness, cosmopolitan abundance, and lentic tolerant abundance were related to % forest cover in the 1-km stream reach, but only in streams that had <15% catchment urban land cover. In these cases, catchment urbanization overwhelmed the potential mitigating effects of riparian forests on stream fishes. Together, these results suggest that catchment land cover is an important driver of fish assemblages in urbanizing catchments, and riparian forests are important but not sufficient for protecting stream ecosystems from the impacts of high levels of urbanization.

AB  - Although thinning of young, even-aged forests may accelerate the development of characteristics associated with mature forests, in the short term it may negatively affect some taxa, including terrestrial salamanders. Preexisting site conditions, including down wood, and forest management measures, such as riparian buffers, may moderate these effects, but these relationships are poorly understood. To explore whether down wood and riparian buffer widths might influence short-term responses to thinning, we sampled salamanders using ground searches before and during the first 2 years after experimental thinning at two 45- to 65-year-old headwater forest sites in western Oregon that differed in down wood volume. Prethinning distributions of terrestrial salamanders overlapped one- and two-tree height riparian buffers, and except for red-backed salamanders, overlapped very little with narrower streamside or variable-width buffers. At the site where down wood volume was low, captures of ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii Gray) and western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum Cooper) both declined by 40% in thinned areas. In contrast, captures of ensatina and Oregon slender salamanders (Batrachoseps wrighti Bishop) were not significantly affected by thinning at the site where down wood volume was high. Our results suggest that site conditions, such as down wood volume, and riparian buffers may influence the effect of thinning on terrestrial salamanders, and demonstrate the tight linkage among management of aquatic, riparian, and upslope resources in headwater forests.

AB  - The composition and structure of riparian forests in the coast redwood region were analyzed in relation to the length of time since timber harvest, and the width of riparian buffer zone. Ten sites were sampled in the central range of the coast redwood forest type within a variety of post-harvest age groups and riparian buffer zone widths. Data was collected using randomly selected sample plots adjacent to perennial coastal steams. Correlation Fisher's r to z tests and two-tailed t-test were used to examine the relationship between the sample variables and the experimental parameters “years since harvest”, and “width of buffer.” Results indicate that canopy cover was negatively correlated to “years since harvest” with the highest level of canopy cover found on the youngest sites and the lowest level found on the old-growth sites. The hardwood to conifer dominance ratio and the basal area of Alnus rubra (red alder) were correlated negatively to both “years since harvest” and “buffer width” indicating that timber harvest favored hardwood species. Late seral associates such as Oxalis oregana (redwood sorrel), Anthyrium filix-femina (lady fern), and Vaccinium parviflorum (billberry) were found preferentially in older forests and sites with wider buffer zones, while non-native species such as Hedera helix (English ivy), Pampas cortedaria (pampas grass), and Myosotis latifolia (forget-me-not) were found preferentially in younger forests and areas with smaller buffer zones.

AB  - Management of headwater streams and their riparian zones has included the implementation of forested riparian buffers, which are intended to protect ecological processes (such as microclimate) and biota, but the appropriate widths for these buffers have been widely debated. We measured the magnitude and extent of microclimatic gradients associated with headwater streams in mature unmanaged forests, and determined whether these patterns were maintained in clearcut harvested units with and without a 30 m-wide riparian buffer on each side of the stream. We measured air temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity between 1 and 70 m from the stream in five replicate blocks of three treatments each in western Oregon. Results indicated the strongest stream effect on air temperature and relative humidity to be within 10 m of the stream in all management treatments at 3:00 pm, and gradients were evident to 20 m in the forested treatment. The clearcut was significantly hotter (air and soil) and drier than either the riparian buffer or the forest treatments at 3:00 pm. The riparian buffer and forest had similar microclimates at all distances from the stream, suggesting that the 30-m buffer adequately protected the riparian microclimatic gradient. We hypothesize that the strong stream effect on microclimate in the riparian zone serves a critical role in mitigating the influence of microclimatic "edge effects" associated with the forest-clearcut edge. Biota dependent on cool, humid microclimates provided by riparian zones will benefit from the implementation of riparian buffers in harvest units.

AB  - In recent years, riparian buffers have become known as one of the most effective best management practices for nonpoint-source pollution. However, establishment of riparian buffer systems with respect to plant species and their position in the buffer zone has not been investigated due to lack of efficient evaluation methods for the analysis of water quality improvement with established riparian buffers. To solve this problem, the SWAT-REMM prototype version was developed by researchers in Canada. In the SWAT-REMM prototype version, many riparian-related input parameters are not directly read from the local input data. Thus, a SWAT-REMM enhancement was developed by improving three major limitations of the prototype version of SWAT-REMM: (1) riparian buffers at designated reaches in the watersheds, (2) riparian buffers using local soil properties at the riparian buffer zone along reaches, and (3) multiple weather stations in a larger-scale watershed. The enhanced SWAT-REMM version was applied to the Bonggok watershed in Korea. This study investigated riparian buffers with different widths (10 m, 5 m, and 1 m) along the slope. Total nitrogen reduction ranged from 14.8% to 54.0% in each catchment for 10 m widths. Total nitrogen reduction ranged from 6.9% to 31.6% in each catchment for 1 m widths. The reduction efficiency was not simply proportional to the width of buffers. This study evaluated the enhanced SWAT-REMM simulation of water quality improvement. Based on this research, the enhanced SWAT-REMM can be used to evaluate water quality improvement by riparian buffers at various watersheds worldwide using local data. In particular, simulation of riparian buffers at user-designated reaches in a watershed enables simulation of riparian buffers in watersheds experiencing frequent flooding where no riparian buffers can be established. It is expected that the enhanced SWAT-REMM can be used to determine economical and environmentally optimum riparian buffer scenarios.

AB  - Invasive species must cope with a suite of environmental conditions that are different from those in their native ranges. We examine how the physicochemical environment contributes to the invasion success of Orconectes palmeri, a non-native crayfish, in the lower Flint River basin, Georgia, USA. We examined the distribution of Procambarus spiculifer, a native crayfish, and O. palmeri within the lower Flint River basin, and examined associations between species relative abundance and physicochemical variables. Within the lower Flint River, O. palmeri was found almost exclusively at upstream sites, while P. spiculifer was more abundant downstream. We did not detect small O. palmeri downstream, suggesting little recruitment in this area. Within tributaries, only native crayfish were observed. O. palmeri was more abundant at sites with warmer water temperatures, and P. spiculifer was more abundant at sites with cooler water temperatures, which were maintained by ground water seepage. P. spiculifer abundance was also positively associated with abundance of coarse wood. Laboratory studies demonstrated that O. palmeri selected warmer temperatures than P. spiculifer, suggesting that warmer temperatures in the upstream area favor O. palmeri. Water temperatures may have increased in recent years due to human withdrawals from the aquifer and the installation of upstream dams, creating a thermal regime that P. spiculifer has not historically encountered. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of groundwater inputs and a forested riparian buffer is crucial to protect populations of P. spiculifer and to prevent further spread by O. palmeri, especially if climatic changes result in warmer waters.

AB  - Across the U.S., multiple species of riparian vegetation have proven to be effective filters of sediment and nutrients in agricultural watersheds. Research at Southern Illinois University Carbondale has focused on giant cane [Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl.] as a potential candidate to incorporate into riparian buffer designs. In 2001, an exploratory study (i.e., Phase I) monitored nutrient and sediment concentrations from surface runoff and groundwater in the Cypress Creek watershed, while two subsequent studies (i.e., Phase II) focused on groundwater quality and added additional riparian buffer plots in the Big Creek and Cache River Watersheds. The primary objective of this research was to compare nutrient attenuation in groundwater of native giant cane and forest riparian buffers. Results from phase I showed significant nutrient reductions in groundwater over short distances in both the giant cane (~3.0 m) and forest buffers (~6.0 m), thus additional wells were installed at 1.5 and 12.0 m for the second phase. Groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N was significantly reduced by 90% in the initial 3.0 m of the giant cane buffer, where plant assimilation and microbial denitrification were likely key NO₃ ⁻-N removal mechanisms. Phase II showed significant reductions in groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N beneath the forest buffers, whereas little change occurred below the giant cane buffers. However, NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations beneath giant cane buffers were 3 times less than those observed beneath the forest buffers. Follow-up studies are being conducted on the transport of E. coli through vegetated buffers, and efforts have been expanded to the watershed-scale.

AB  - A naturally functioning riparian zone is essential for the ecological health of a river, filtering pollutants, supplying organic matter and providing a structural habitat for wildlife. Most lowland rivers would also naturally flood the riparian zone at regular intervals, thereby providing direct inputs of nutrients and water that create additional habitats and breeding opportunities for riverine species. We examined the relationship between the quality of the riparian habitat and foraging and activity of bats (Chiroptera), which are good indicators of ecosystem health. Twenty paired sites in the Rivers Lee and Colne catchments in England were selected to test the hypothesis that degradation in the quality of riparian habitat reduces foraging and activity in bats; paired sites were similar in terms of size, flow rate and water chemistry but differed in the quality of their riparian zones. AnaBat detectors were used to measure bat activity from 30 min before dusk to 30 min after sunrise on the same night at paired sites because recording frequency-divided bat echolocation calls in real time allows large amounts of data to be collected over long time periods in a digitized format. Significantly more feeding buzzes were recorded in sites with better quality riparian zones; no differences in overall bat activity were found between the two habitat types. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus accounted for 96% of bat passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus was significantly more active in high quality sites than P. pipistrellus; there was no difference between the two species in poor quality sites. We show that the quality of riparian buffer zones is important for the activity and feeding behaviour of pipistrelle bats.

AB  - A low-impact surface flow sampler was developed for riparian studies conducted in the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern United States. The device consists of two primary components, a splitter and a collector, which were used for unattended sampling of surface flow in riparian buffer study areas. This low-cost device provides a composite event sample at selected locations within experimental areas. The quantity of sample is adequate for laboratory analyses of dissolved and suspended constituents for both large and small flow events, and permits estimation of the volume of surface flow at the sampling location. Installation and operation of the device requires little disturbance to the riparian buffer ground surface and vegetation, or to surface flow within experimental areas.

AB  - I investigated the role of habitat structure in explaining bird species richness and abundance in riparian buffer strips of old-growth coniferous forest on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Using buffer strips of varying widths and a control from undisturbed riparian forest, I tested the hypothesis that vegetation differs in buffer strips of varying width. I selected 10 summary variables to represent broad-scale vegetation attributes of riparian habitat. Deciduous tree density was higher, and shrub richness was lower in wide buffers compared with narrow buffers. I then used Akaike information criterion to examine whether vegetation structure or buffer width best explained patterns of bird richness and abundance in riparian habitats. Species richness and abundance in several foraging guilds were explained better by buffer width than by vegetation. Abundances of three bird habitat guilds: riparian specialists, forest-interior, and open-edge species, and 6 of 10 species were best explained by specific vegetation features. Differences in vegetation, particularly deciduous tree density and shrub cover, explained part of the variation in abundance of several riparian forest-dwelling species and may be useful in evaluating specific forest management practices. Because deciduous tree density is also positively correlated with buffer width, wide buffers (>100 m) may benefit not only those species associated with coniferous upland forests and forest generalists sensitive to buffer width, but also those species whose abundance is associated with deciduous trees.

AB  - A field monitoring study of a riparian forest buffer zone was conducted to determine the impact of the riparian ecosystem on reducing the concentration of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and December 1994, and analyzed for NO(3)-N, PO4, and NH(4)-N. Statistical analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields. Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field. Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer season for most sampling locations.

AB  - The influence of land use on potential fates of nitrate (NO3 −) in stream ecosystems, ranging from denitrification to storage in organic matter, has not been documented extensively. Here, we describe the Pacific Northwest component of Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment, phase II (LINX II) to examine how land-use setting influences fates of NO3 − in streams. We used 24 h releases of a stable isotope tracer (15NO3-N) in nine streams flowing through forest, agricultural, and urban land uses to quantify NO3 − uptake processes. NO3 − uptake lengths varied two orders of magnitude (24–4247 m), with uptake rates (6.5–158.1 mg NO3-N m−2 day−1) and uptake velocities (0.1–2.3 mm min−1) falling within the ranges measured in other LINX II regions. Denitrification removed 0–7% of added tracer from our streams. In forest streams, 60.4 to 77.0% of the isotope tracer was exported downstream as NO3 −, with 8.0 to 14.8% stored in wood biofilms, epilithon, fine benthic organic matter, and bryophytes. Agricultural and urban streams with streamside forest buffers displayed hydrologic export and organic matter storage of tracer similar to those measured in forest streams. In agricultural and urban streams with a partial or no riparian buffer, less than 1 to 75% of the tracer was exported downstream; much of the remainder was taken up and stored in autotrophic organic matter components with short N turnover times. Our findings suggest restoration and maintenance of riparian forests can help re-establish the natural range of NO3 − uptake processes in human-altered streams.

AB  - We assessed the relationship between riparian management and stream quality along five southeastern Minnesota streams in 1995 and 1996. Specifically, we examined the effect of rotationally and continuously grazed pastures and different types of riparian buffer strips on water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish as indicators of stream quality. We collected data at 17 sites under different combinations of grazing and riparian management, using a longitudinal design on three streams and a paired watershed design on two others. Continuous and rotational grazing were compared along one longitudinal study stream and at the paired watershed. Riparian buffer management, fenced trees (wood buffer), fenced grass, and unfenced rotationally grazed areas were the focus along the two remaining longitudinal streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) of water chemistry, physical habitat, and biotic data indicated a local management effect. The ordinations separated continuous grazing from sites with rotational grazing and sites with wood buffers from those with grass buffers or rotationally grazed areas. Fecal coliform and turbidity were consistently higher at continuously grazed than rotationally grazed sites. Percent fines in the streambed were significantly higher at sites with wood buffers than grass and rotationally grazed areas, and canopy cover was similar at sites with wood and grass buffers. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significant but were not consistent across grazing and riparian buffer management types. Fish density and abundance were related to riparian buffer type, rather than grazing practices. Our study has potentially important implications for stream restoration programs in the midwestern United States. Our comparisons suggest further consideration and study of a combination of grass and wood riparian buffer strips as midwestern stream management options, rather than universally installing wood buffers in every instance.

AB  - Understanding the influence of habitat alteration on population structure and persistence is critical for effective conservation strategies. Timber harvest and wildfire are two of the most prevalent disturbances across temperate forests, yet the long-term effects of these two forces on population connectivity have rarely been studied. We studied populations of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) across landscapes that have experienced either timber harvest or broad scale fires. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs generally require forested habitat, and are a species of concern in managed forests. We used landscape genetic techniques to test the explanatory power of alternative paths of connectivity across both burned and harvested forests and identified topographical and climatic variables that significantly influenced gene flow. We found that timber harvest and fire led to different patterns of genetic connectivity. Widespread terrestrial gene flow was maintained across previously burned areas and connectivity was primarily limited by solar radiation. In contrast, gene flow among populations in managed forests followed riparian corridors, presumably to avoid the loss of cover due to timber harvest. Gene flow along riparian corridors in Rocky Mountain tailed frogs differs from a population of the closely related coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), for which gene flow appears to occur primarily over land. These results suggest management of Rocky Mountain tailed frogs should focus on maintaining riparian buffer zones, which may be less effective for the coastal species. Thus, consideration of landscape differences is essential even for conservation of closely related, morphologically similar species.

AB  - Current restoration of stream and lotic freshwater systems to ‘good ecological status’ has focused on the creation of vegetated riparian buffer strips. Yet, despite this constituting a major land‐use change, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these strips on riparian organisms. We investigated the effect that widespread adoption of buffer strips may have on activity density, species diversity, and assemblage composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Over 2� years, we sampled carabids from 41 riparian margins within two river catchments in north‐east Scotland. We compared three types of riparian margin: unbuffered (i.e. ‘unimproved’), vegetated buffer strips, and wooded, the latter acting as reference sites. A range of site parameters including characteristics of soil, water, and vegetation were recorded and the extent to which they correlated with ground beetle assemblages was explored. Catchment and treatment effects were detected on ground beetle activity density and species diversity with unbuffered sites showing higher activity density and species richness. The assemblage structure differed according to catchment, treatment, and local characteristics. Multivariate analysis suggested that soil and vegetation parameters and stream width, together with buffer strip age and length were determinants of assemblage structure. Few riparian species were found in large numbers. This study shows that in intensively managed agricultural landscapes riparian buffer strips do not create the quality of habitat required by truly riparian species. They do, however, provide habitat for woodland and stenotopic species and with more careful planning could play a role in increasing habitat heterogeneity at a landscape scale.

AB  - Catchment riparian areas are considered key zones to target mitigation measures aimed at interrupting the movement of diffuse substances from agricultural land to surface waters. Hence, unfertilized buffer strips have become a widely studied and implemented “edge of field” mitigation measure assumed to provide an effective physical barrier against nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sediment transfer. To ease the legislative process, these buffers are often narrow mandatory strips along streams and rivers, across different riparian soil water conditions, between bordering land uses of differing pollution burdens, and without prescribed buffer management. It would be easy to criticize such regulation for not providing the opportunity for riparian ecosystems to maximize their provision for a wider range of ecosystem goods and services. The scientific basis for judging the best course of action in designing and placing buffers to enhance their multifunctionality has slowly increased over the last five years. This collection of papers aims to add to this body of knowledge by giving examples of studies related to riparian buffer management and assessment throughout Europe. This introductory paper summarizes discussion sessions and 13 selected papers from a workshop held in Ballater, UK, highlighting research on riparian buffers brought together under the EU COST Action 869 knowledge exchange program. The themes addressed are (i) evidence of catchment- to national-scale effectiveness, (ii) ecological functioning linking terrestrial and aquatic habitats, (iii) modeling tools for assessment of effectiveness and costs, and (iv) process understanding enabling management and manipulation to enhance pollutant retention in buffers. The combined understanding led us to consider four principle key questions to challenge buffer strip research and policy.

AB  - The retention of nutrients in narrow, vegetated riparian buffer strips (VBS) is uncertain and underlying processes are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that buffer soils are poor at retaining dissolved nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), necessitating management actions if P retention is not to be compromised. We sampled 19 buffer strips and adjacent arable field soils. Differences in nutrient retention between buffer and field soils were determined using a combined assay for release of dissolved P, N, and C forms and particulate P. We then explored these differences in relation to changes in soil bulk density (BD), moisture, organic matter by loss on ignition (OM), and altered microbial diversity using molecular fingerprinting (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [TRFLP]). Buffer soils had significantly greater soil OM (89% of sites), moisture content (95%), and water-soluble nutrient concentrations for dissolved organic C (80%), dissolved organic N (80%), dissolved organic P (55%), and soluble reactive P (70%). Buffer soils had consistently smaller bulk densities than field soils. Soil fine particle release was generally greater for field than buffer soils. Significantly smaller soil bulk density in buffer soils than in adjacent fields indicated increased porosity and infiltration in buffers. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities showed altered diversity between the buffer and field soils, with significant relationships with soil BD, moisture, OM, and increased solubility of buffer nutrients. Current soil conditions in VBS appear to be leading to potentially enhanced nutrient leaching via increasing solubility of C, N, and P. Manipulating soil microbial conditions (by management of soil moisture, vegetation type, and cover) may provide options for increasing the buffer storage for key nutrients such as P without increasing leaching to adjacent streams.

AB  - Spatial regression, incorporating spatial error or lag dependency, was performed to interpret determinants of hazardous chemicals at full sub-basin scale and at 500m riparian buffer scale in Qiantang River, eastern coastal China. Monitoring data from 41 monitoring stations were collected between 1996 and 2003 and pretreated for 7 variables—petroleum, hexavalent chromium, total cadmium, total lead, total mercury, total cyanide, and volatile phenol. Results showed that primary predictors and the predictive ability of spatial regression differed with variables and scales. Topology, distance to river source, land use/land cover (LULC), population density, and gross domestic product (GDP) can be primary predictors for the pattern of certain hazardous chemical variables in 1996 and 2003. LULC types were good predictors for changes of cyanide and heavy metals, while GDP and population density contributed to petroleum dynamics between 1996 and 2003. This study demonstrated that spatial regression is a promising tool for generating indicators to tackle with hazardous chemical pollution. We also advocate applying multi-scale approaches to uncover the dynamics of hazardous chemicals.

AB  - This study employed spatial regression to analyze the determinants of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nutrients in the Qiantang River, China. Determinants of their spatial patterns in 1996 and 2003 as well as their dynamics during this time period were characterized at sub-basin and 500-m riparian buffer scales. Results indicated that the determinants differed by variable and by scale. Built-ups, farmland, water body, population density and gross domestic product were positive indicators for nutrient pollution and hypoxia, while distance to river source and forest were negative indicators. Higher slope variability indicates more DO and nutrients. In addition, built-up increases that were accelerated by population growth and economic development accounted for DO and nutrients dynamics to a large extent. This study highlighted that incorporation of spatial autocorrelation into regression was not only a methodological advantage but also a promising management tool.

AB  - Scientific interpretation of the relationships between urban landscape patterns and water quality is important for sustainable urban planning and watershed environmental protection. This study applied the ordinary least squares regression model and the geographically weighted regression model to examine the spatially varying relationships between 12 explanatory variables (including three topographical factors, four land use parameters, and five landscape metrics) and 15 water quality indicators in watersheds of Yundang Lake, Maluan Bay, and Xinglin Bay with varying levels of urbanization in Xiamen City, China. A local and global investigation was carried out at the watershed-level, with 50 and 200� m riparian buffer scales. This study found that topographical features and landscape metrics are the dominant factors of water quality, while land uses are too weak to be considered as a strong influential factor on water quality. Such statistical results may be related with the characteristics of land use compositions in our study area. Water quality variations in the 50� m buffer were dominated by topographical variables. The impact of landscape metrics on water quality gradually strengthen with expanding buffer zones. The strongest relationships are obtained in entire watersheds, rather than in 50 and 200� m buffer zones. Spatially varying relationships and effective buffer zones were verified in this study. Spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and water quality parameters are more diversified and complex in less urbanized areas than in highly urbanized areas. This study hypothesizes that all these varying relationships may be attributed to the heterogeneity of landscape patterns in different urban regions. Adjustment of landscape patterns in an entire watershed should be the key measure to successfully improving urban lake water quality.

AB  - The lower Tarim River had dried up nearly 30years before an ecological water diversion project (EWDP) for ecological restoration was implemented in 2000. Since then, eight intermittent water deliveries have been carried out for restoring this seriously degraded riparian ecosystem. To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of these operations, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set derived from bands 1 and 2 of the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA's Terra satellite was applied to identify the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover along the river corridor with about 320km in length. The goal of this study is thus to generate seasonally integrated NDVI (SINDVI) in growing seasons between April and October so as to investigate a general vegetation patterns as well as examine the inter-annual SINDVI for discerning the status of ecosystem restoration. The spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover were further characterized based on those inter-annual SINDVI data with the aid of Coefficient of Variation (CoV). Research findings indicate that ecosystem integrity was strengthened after a series of water diversion efforts and groundwater table control in the past few years. As the degree of ecosystem restoration is in progress, continuous operation of water diversion is still necessary in response to the needs for restoration of dense vegetation in the riparian buffer within this arid or semi-arid region.

AB  - Restoration of riparian buffers is an important component of nutrient reduction strategies in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In 1998, Maryland adopted a Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which provides financial incentives to take agricultural land out of production to plant streamside vegetation. Between 1998 and 2005, 1-30% of streamside vegetation (average = 11%), was restored to forest or managed grass in 15 agriculturally dominated sub-basins in the Choptank River basin, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Pre-existing forested buffers represented 10-48% of the streamside (average = 33%), for a total of 12-61% buffered streamsides (average = 44%). Using multi-year water quality data collected before and after CREP implementation (1986, 2003-2006), we were unable to detect significant effects of CREP on baseflow nutrient concentrations based on the area of restored buffer, the percentage of restored streamside, or the percentage of total riparian buffer in the sub-basins (p > 0.05). Although CREP increased the average buffered streamside from 33% in the 1990s to 44% by 2005, N and P concentrations have not changed or have increased in some streams over the last 20 years. Reductions may not have occurred for the following reasons: (1) buffer age, width, and connectivity (gaps) between buffers are also important to nutrient reductions; (2) agricultural nutrient inputs may have increased during this period; and (3) riparian buffer restoration was not extensive enough by 2005 to have measurable affects on the stream water quality in these sub-basins. Significant effects of CREP may yet be resolved as the current CREP buffers mature; however, water quality data through 2006 in the Choptank basin do not yet show any significant effects.

AB  - Arundinaria gigantea, or river cane, is a potential riparian buffer, and there is general interest in the restoration of the species to the southern Appalachian mountains. Proper classification of A. gigantea is critical in determining suitable candidate sites for planting. The 1988 National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands lists A. gigantea as facultative wetland (FACW) for the southeast and elsewhere. In this article, we review plant, soil, and hydrologic data collected at 20 A. gigantea sites in western North Carolina, USA, and discuss the species wetland classification in light of our findings. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat), bulk density (ρb), elemental abundance, soil description, plant identification, and hydrologic data are presented and suggest that river cane is currently classified incorrectly, and that an upland (UPL) or facultative upland (FACU) classification is more appropriate. None of the sites studied meet all 3 criteria common to wetland definitions (hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology), although one of the sites had several wetland characteristics. We suggest that river cane restoration should occur in well drained, sandy soils and that the species should only be used as a riparian buffer in this type of setting.

AB  - Effects of riparian harvesting on in-stream biota were monitored in five streams in exotic conifer plantations that differed in how logs were extracted, patterns in deposition of woody debris, and the degree to which riparian buffers were retained. Streams were sampled on three occasions in summer, once prior to harvesting and twice afterwards. Consistent effects of harvesting included an increase in the amount of woody debris in the channel, increased fine sediment and a trend towards higher algal productivity. Invertebrate communities changed dramatically in some streams. General patterns included an increase in small sized taxa and taxa with generalist diets in the first year after harvest, then a trend towards a greater representation of grazers and larger taxa the following year. Responses in particular taxa were highly variable between streams. Some of this variability was related to forestry management, the least dramatic changes occurring where a narrow riparian buffer strip was retained. Reduced impacts were also observed in streams where woody debris was piled over the channel. We suggest that management practices that maintain shading of the stream channel will moderate forestry effects, and that practices such as channel cleaning are likely to be detrimental.

AB  - A watershed’s riparian corridor presents opportunities to stabilize streambanks, intercept runoff, and influence shallow groundwater with riparian buffers. This paper presents a system to classify these riparian opportunities and apply it towards riparian management planning in HUC12 watersheds. High resolution (3-m grid) digital elevation models derived from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data are analyzed to identify spatial distributions of surface runoff contributions and shallow water tables in a watershed’s riparian zones. Results are tabulated and a cross classification is applied to convey recommendations for buffer vegetation and width. Classes of buffers include those primarily placed to: 1) trap runoff and sediment; 2) influence shallow groundwater; 3) address both runoff and shallow groundwater, and; 4) maintain/improve stream bank stability. This system was applied to two headwater watersheds from each of three landform regions found in Iowa and Illinois. Riparian buffers that could intercept runoff and/or stabilize streambanks would occupy about 2.5% of the total areas of these watersheds, but intercept runoff contributions from 81-94% of the watersheds. However, the distributions of riparian zones where shallow water tables (SWT) were >25 m wide varied according to landform region. Nevertheless, these riparian zones with a wide SWT area were the most common riparian setting in all six watersheds, and found to occupy 23-53% of stream bank lengths among the six watersheds. The wide SWT setting provides opportunities to reduce nutrient loads carried via groundwater, and could be managed for a variety of ecosystem services. This riparian classification and mapping system should provide a consistent basis for developing riparian corridor plans and identifying management priorities in Midwestern headwater catchments where high resolution elevation data are available.

AB  - Summer stream water quality was monitored before and following the logging of 50% of the boreal forest within three small watersheds (<50 ha) nested in the 'Ruisseau des Eaux-Volées' Experimental Watershed, Montmorency Forest (Québec, Canada). Logging was conducted in winter, on snow cover according to recommended best management practices (BMPs) to minimize soil disturbance and protect advance growth. A 20-m forest buffer was maintained along perennial streams. In watershed 7·2, cut-blocks were located near the stream network and logging was partially allowed within the riparian buffer zone. In watersheds 7·5 and 7·7, logging occurred farther away from the stream network. Observations were also made for watershed 7·3 that collected the runoff from watersheds 7·2 and 7·5, and watershed 7·6, the uproad portion of watershed 7·7. The control watershed 0·2 was contiguous to the impacted watersheds and remained undisturbed. Following clearcutting, changes in summer daily maximum and minimum stream temperatures remained within ± 1 °C while changes in diurnal variation did not decrease by more than 0·5 °C. Concentrations of NO₃ ⁻ greatly increased by up to 6000% and concentrations of K⁺ increased by up to 300% during the second summer after logging. Smaller increases were observed for Fetotal (up to 71%), specific conductance (up to 26%), and Mg²⁺ (up to 19%). Post-logging pH decreased slightly by no more than 7% while PO₄ ³⁻ concentration remained relatively constant. Suspended sediment concentrations appeared to increase during post-logging, but there was not enough pre-logging data to statistically confirm this result. Logging of moderate intensity and respecting established BMPs may account for the limited changes of water quality parameters and the low exceedances of the criteria for the protection of aquatic life. The proximity of the cutover to the stream network and logging within the riparian zone did not appear to affect water quality. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Chronically nitrate-loaded riparian buffer zones show high N₂O emissions. Often, a large part of the N₂O is emitted from small surface areas, resulting in high spatial variability in these buffer zones. These small surface areas with high N₂O emissions (hotspots) need to be investigated to generate knowledge on the factors governing N₂O emissions. In this study the N₂O emission variability was investigated at different spatial scales. Therefore N₂O emissions from three 32 m² grids were determined in summer and winter. Spatial variation and total emission were determined on three different scales (0.3 m², 0.018 m² and 0.0013 m²) at plots with different levels of N₂O emissions. Spatial variation was high at all scales determined and highest at the smallest scale. To test possible factors inducing small scale hotspots, soil samples were collected for slurry incubation to determine responses to increased electron donor/acceptor availability. Acetate addition did increase N₂O production, but nitrate addition failed to increase total denitrification or net N₂O production. N₂O production was similar in all soil slurries, independent of their origin from high or low emission soils, indicating that environmental conditions (including physical factors like gas diffusion) rather than microbial community composition governed N₂O emission rates.

AB  - The quality of the water of Laguna de Bay is been threatened by industrial and domestic activities in its western bay and agricultural activities in its eastern bay contribute to nutrient and pesticide discharges affecting the lake. A pesticide monitoring study of surface water of the Lucban River and Salasad Creek in the Pagsanjan-Lumban watershed of Laguna de Bay showed that some of the pesticides used by farmers to protect their crops from pests are being transported in drainage water. In the Lucban River, malathion was detected throughout the monitoring period from 2007 to 2009 at concentrations ranging from 0.005μg/L to 3.3μg/L. The detections of pesticides corresponded with times of pesticide application in the field. Profenofos was detected at concentrations of 0.5–15.3μg/L during 2008–2009 in water of Salasad Creek. The concentrations exceeded the (WHO, 2006) recommended level of 0.1μg/L for single pesticide in drinking water. There was no direct relationship between total suspended sediments and concentration of pesticides present in the surface water of Lucban River and Salasad Creek. Malathion and profenofos were transported from site of application to water bodies predominantly (>60%) in the soluble (<1.2μm) phase. Although the concentration of malathion increased in January with increasing rainfall the trend was not consistent throughout the study period. Measures to mitigate the off-site movement of malathion and profenofos to surface water need to be implemented to protect the quality of the eastern bay of the lake. This study shows that pesticide applications to crops very close to the water bodies, a common practice in the Philippines, is responsible for contamination of the creek and river, and a first step in reducing contamination would be improve practices in the areas closest to the drainage system, perhaps by introducing a narrow (3–5m) riparian buffer zone in which spraying in not permitted. However, this strategy would have limited effectiveness for compounds that move predominantly in a soluble phase.

AB  - Logging and other forest practices are widely reported to be a threat to some amphibian populations in the Pacific Northwest. Riparian buffer strips are one conservation measure that may benefit amphibians in managed forests. However, few amphibian surveys have been conducted in buffer strips. We compared total salamander abundance, amphibian species richness, and sampling proportions for five species of salamanders between 17 managed stands and 12 unlogged, streamside forests in the Coast Range of western Oregon. We also identified relationships between buffer strip width and salamander population indices. Surveys conducted on 20 x 40 m plots demonstrated that torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.), clouded salamanders (Aneides ferreus), Dunn's salamanders (Plethodon dunni), western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum), total salamander abundance, and amphibian species richness were sensitive to forest practices in riparian areas. We conclude that riparian buffer strips are a useful habitat management strategy for several salamander species. However, buffer strip widths currently required by state forest practices regulations may not be adequate to prevent local declines in the diversity of amphibian communities.

AB  - Being able to identify riparian sites that function better for nitrate removal from groundwater is critical to using efficiently the riparian zones for water quality management. For this purpose, managers need a method that is quick, inexpensive, and accurate enough to enable effective management decisions. This study assesses the precision and accuracy of a simple method using three ground water wells and one measurement date for determining nitrate removal characteristics of riparian buffer zones. The method is a scaled-down version of a complex field research method that consists of a large network of wells and piezometers monitored monthly for over two years. Results using the simplified method were compared to those from the reference research method on a date-by-date basis on eight sites covering a wide range of hydrogeomorphic settings. The accuracy of the three-well, 1 day measurement method was relatively good for assessing nitrate concentration depletion across riparian zones, but poor for assessing the distance necessary to achieve a 90% nitrate removal and for estimating water and nitrate fluxes compared to the reference method. The simplified three-well method provides relatively better estimates of water and nitrate fluxes on sites where ground-water flow is parallel to the water table through homogeneous aquifer material, but such conditions may not be geographically widespread. Despite limited overall accuracy, some parameters that are estimated using the simplified method may be useful to water resource managers. Nitrate depletion information may be used to assess the adequacy of existing buffers to achieve nitrate concentration goals for runoff. Estimates of field nitrate runoff and buffer removal fluxes may be adequate for prioritizing management toward sites where riparian buffers are likely to have greater impact on stream water quality.

AB  - The denitrification process and the associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production in soils have been poorly documented, especially in terms of soil profiles; most work on denitrification has concentrated on the upper layer (first 20 cm). The objectives of this study were to examine the origin of N2O emission and the effects of in situ controlling factors on soil denitrification and N2O production, also allowing the (N2O production)/(NO3 −–N reduction) ratio to be determined through (1) the position on a slope reaching a river and (2) the depth (soil horizons: 10–30 and 90–110 cm). In 2009 and 2010, slurry batch experiments combined with molecular investigations of bacterial communities were conducted in a corn field and an adjacent riparian buffer strip. Denitrification rates, ranging from 0.30 μg NO3 −–N g−1 dry soil h−1 to 1.44 μg NO3 −–N g−1 dry soil h−1, showed no significant variation along the slope and depth. N2O production assessed simultaneously differed considerably over the depth and ranged from 0.4 ng N2O–N g−1 dry soil h−1 in subsoils (the 90–110-cm layer) to 155.1 ng N2O–N g−1 dry soil h−1 in the topsoils (the 10–30-cm layer). In the topsoils, N2O–N production accounted for 8.5–48.0% of the total denitrified NO3 −–N, but for less than 1% in the subsoils. Similarly, N2O-consuming bacterial communities from the subsoils greatly differed from those of the topsoils, as revealed by their nosZ DGGE fingerprints. High N2O-SPPR (nitrous oxide semi potential production rates) in comparison to NO3-SPDR (nitrate semi potential reduction rates) for the topsoils indicated significant potential greenhouse N2O gas production, whereas lower horizons could play a role in fully removing nitrate into inert atmospheric N2. In terms of landscape management, these results call for caution in rehabilitating or constructing buffer zones for agricultural nitrate removal.

AB  - Nitrous oxide emissions from soils are known to be variable in both space and time. To better understand this variability, this study was conducted to (i) evaluate the landscape-scale patterns and seasonal variations in N₂O emissions, (ii) determine the contribution of the different environmental factors (texture and organic matter content of the soil, crop management, mineral nitrogen content, and fertilizer application) on the estimation of N₂O emissions at the field scale. We used static chamber and gas chromatography methods to measure N₂O emissions in the Orgeval sub-basin (Seine Basin, France), in representative sites selected on the basis of land use: a continuum from an agricultural plateau to the riparian buffer, grassland and a forest site. A consistent landscape-scale pattern of N₂O emissions was observed with higher emissions in the footslope (annual flux of 4.0±2.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) than in the slope positions (1.1±0.6 and 1.9±1.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) or the shoulder positions (1.1±0.5kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Nitrous oxide emissions from the riparian buffer were significant with an annual budget of 0.5±0.4kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, while extrapolated emissions from forest and grassland were 0.6±0.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and 0.7±0.2kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, respectively. Topography plays a role mainly in its relation with hydrological processes which, in turn, regulate the soil factors (mainly water-filled pore space) controlling N₂O emissions at the microscale level. The seasonal fluctuations of N₂O emissions were influenced by precipitations (pulses after large rainfall events following fertilization) and thawing.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes nitrification, denitrification and ammonia (NH₃) volatilization. SPOT-5 and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of R ² =0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) removal by vegetation uptake is one of the most important functions of riparian buffer zones in preventing non-point source pollution (NSP), and many studies about N uptake at the river reach scale have proven the effectiveness of plants in controlling nutrient pollution. However, at the watershed level, the riparian zones form dendritic networks and, as such, may be the predominant spatially structured feature in catchments and landscapes. Thus, assessing the functions of riparian system at the basin scale is important. In this study, a new method coupling remote sensing and ecological models was used to assess the N removal by riparian vegetation on a large spatial scale. The study site is located around the Guanting reservoir in Beijing, China, which was abandoned as the source water system for Beijing due to serious NSP in 1997. SPOT 5 data was used to map the land cover, and Landsat-5 TM time series images were used to retrieve land surface parameters. A modified forest nutrient cycling and biomass model (ForNBM) was used to simulate N removal, and the modified net primary productivity (NPP) module was driven by remote sensing image time series. Besides the remote sensing data, the necessary database included meteorological data, soil chemical and physical data and plant nutrient data. Pot and plot experiments were used to calibrate and validate the simulations. Our study has proven that, by coupling remote sensing data and parameters retrieval techniques to plant growth process models, catchment scale estimations of nitrogen uptake rates can be improved by spatial pixel-based modelling.

AB  - We examined the distribution and foraging behaviour of northern waterthrushes (Seiurus noveboracensis) in recently harvested and intact landscapes of Newfoundland. Data were collected along six 1-km segments of stream and adjoining upland habitat resulting in four treatments (harvested or intact, upland or stream) with three replicates each. Although known as a riparian specialist, we found waterthrush territories equally distributed across intact upland and riparian habitats. However, few waterthrushes occupied harvested uplands, while large numbers packed into riparian buffer strips adjacent to these 5- to 10-year-old postharvest clearcuts. Arthropod abundance and biomass were highly variable between years and across the four treatments, generating significant year × treatment interaction effects. Riparian habitat (in both intact and harvested areas) had consistently greater numbers of arthropod prey and more biomass than either upland habitat type. Northern waterthrushes foraging in riparian habitat adjacent to harvested uplands had lower attack rates and more frequent long flights than waterthrushes foraging in the intact treatment types. Prolonged packing of individuals into riparian buffer strips, and apparent adverse affects on waterthrush foraging efficiency, raise concerns about the effectiveness of buffer strips for sustaining viable populations of terrestrial riparian habitat specialists.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) of surface waters is a significant issue in agricultural lands, and best management practices (BMPs) are often used to reduce these impacts. Since the effectiveness of a BMP depends on a large number of widely varying factors, it is important to continue to develop BMPs in order to provide designers with more tools to use to maximize NPS removal. The contour weep berm is a new structural BMP constructed out of earth and subsequently vegetated. It is a linear BMP that is used in combination with a down-gradient vegetated filter strip or forested riparian buffer. Preliminary field evaluations of the contour weep berm indicate it is effective at reducing runoff volumes and peaks, promoting infiltration, and reducing sediment concentrations in runoff. Procedures for designing a contour weep berm are presented along with a design example. Linear BMPs, such as the contour weep berm, can provide producers with another means of effectively controlling NPS.

AB  - 1. The main objectives of our study were (i) to establish the relative impact of pressures that degrade ecological status, especially those caused by agriculture and urbanisation, (ii) to identify regional patterns in these pressure-impact relationships and (iii) to evaluate the relative weight of the pressures acting at the basin and riparian corridor scales, and the possible buffering effect of riparian areas. 2. We developed large-scale models linking invertebrate indices of ecological quality to river basin and riparian land cover in France, Slovakia, Estonia and U.K. Invertebrate indices, transformed to ecological quality ratios (EQR), were taken from national monitoring networks. We based the models on partial least squares (PLS) regressions at national and a hydro-ecoregion (HER) scales. The HERs provided a framework for grouping data in terms of natural river features and human activities. 3. The different national methods provided consistent results that indicated the hierarchy of pressures impacting river invertebrates at the European scale. Artificial land cover (e.g. urban and industrial sites) in the river basin represented the pressure with the most negative impact on invertebrate indices, in all countries and regions. 4. The impact of agricultural land cover was more variable. Arable land had a smaller impact than urban areas and was insignificant in some models. The proportion of arable land in the river basin appeared to be a weak predictor of agricultural impacts by itself; the type of cultivation and intensity as well as the proximity to the river must be taken into account. 5. At the riparian corridor scale, the negative impact of artificial areas or arable land and the positive effects of forests and pastures were demonstrated in many regions. The protective effect of riparian forests against mixed agricultural and urban pressures was demonstrated in three regions in France. Riparian corridors appear to be manageable areas, and these results strongly support the idea of including their restoration in priority actions for achieving good ecological status.

AB  - We present an overview of USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) computer models and databases related to pest-management science, emphasizing current developments in environmental risk assessment and management simulation models. The ARS has a unique national interdisciplinary team of researchers in surface and sub-surface hydrology, soil and plant science, systems analysis and pesticide science, who have networked to develop empirical and mechanistic computer models describing the behavior of pests, pest responses to controls and the environmental impact of pest-control methods. Historically, much of this work has been in support of production agriculture and in support of the conservation programs of our action agency sister, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service). Because we are a public agency, our software/database products are generally offered without cost, unless they are developed in cooperation with a private-sector cooperator. Because ARS is a basic and applied research organization, with development of new science as our highest priority, these products tend to be offered on an as-is basis with limited user support except for cooperating R&D relationship with other scientists. However, rapid changes in the technology for information analysis and communication continually challenge our way of doing business.

AB  - In northeastern Austria, marshlands have been turned into the most productive arable land of the country. As a result, most headwater streams show structurally degraded channels, lacking riparian buffer zones, which are heavily loaded with nutrients from the surrounding crop fields. The present study examines whether longitudinally restricted riparian forest buffers can enhance the in-stream nutrient retention in nutrient-enriched headwater streams. We estimated nutrient uptake from pairwise, short-term addition experiments with 15NH4, NH4, PO4, and NaCl within reaches with riparian forest buffers (RFB) and degraded reaches (DEG) of the same streams. Riparian forest buffers originated from the conservation of the pristine vegetation or from restoration measures. Hydrologic retention was calculated with the model OTIS-P on the basis of conductivity break-through curves from the salt injections. A significant increase in surface transient storage was revealed in pristine and restored RFB reaches compared with DEG reaches due to the longitudinal step-pool pattern and the frequent occurrence of woody debris on the channel bed. Ammonium uptake lengths were significantly shorter in RFB reaches than in DEG reaches, resulting from the higher hydrologic retention. Uptake velocities did not differ significantly between RFB and DEG reaches, indicating that riparian forest buffers did not affect the biochemical nutrient demand. Uptake of 15NH4 was mainly driven by autotrophs. Net PO4 uptake was not affected by riparian forest buffers. The study shows that the physical and biogeochemical effects of riparian forest buffers on the in-stream nutrient retention are limited in the case of highly eutrophic streams.

AB  - The Willamette Valley of Oregon has extensive areas of poorly drained, commercial grass seed lands. Little is know about the ability of riparian areas in these settings to reduce nitrate in water draining from grass seed fields. We established two study sites with similar soils and hydrology but contrasting riparian vegetation along an intermittent stream that drains perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) fields in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We installed a series of nested piezometers along three transects at each site to examine NO3–N in shallow ground water in grass seed fields and riparian areas. Results showed that a noncultivated riparian zone comprised of grasses and herbaceous vegetation significantly reduced NO3–N concentrations of shallow ground water moving from grass seed fields. Darcy's law–based estimates of shallow ground water flow through riparian zone A/E horizons revealed that this water flowpath could account for only a very small percentage of the streamflow. Even though there is great potential for NO3–N to be reduced as water moves through the noncultivated riparian zone with grass–herbaceous vegetation, the potential was not fully realized because only a small proportion of the stream flow interacts with riparian zone soils. Consequently, effective NO3–N water quality management in poorly drained landscapes similar to the study watershed is primarily dependent on implementation of sound agricultural practices within grass seed fields and is less influenced by riparian zone vegetation. Wise fertilizer application rates and timing are key management tools to reduce export of NO3–N in stream waters.

AB  - Agriculture in coastal areas of Puerto Rico is often adjacent to or near mangrove wetlands. Riparian buffers, while they may also be wetlands, can be used to protect mangrove wetlands from agricultural inputs of sediment, nutrients, and pesticides. We used simulation models and field data to estimate the water, nitrogen, and phosphorus inputs from an agricultural field and riparian buffer to a mangrove wetland in Jobos Bay watershed, Puerto Rico. We used the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) and the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) models sequentially to simulate the hydrology and water quality of the agricultural fields and an adjacent riparian buffer, respectively. Depth to the water table surface was measured monthly at numerous sites in both field and riparian areas and were used with recording well data from outside the field to estimate daily water table depths in the field and riparian buffer and to calibrate field-scale hydrologic processes. Calibration and validation of the models were successful for the riparian buffer and in three of four field quadrants. In these areas the average simulated depth to water table for the field and the riparian buffer were within ±7% of field estimated water table depths. Over the 3-year study period, the riparian buffer represented by REMM reduced agricultural loadings to the mangrove wetland by 24% for sediment yield, and about 30% for total nitrogen and phosphorus. Simulations indicated that tropical storms and hurricanes played an important role in water and nutrient transport on this site contributing at least 63% of total sediment and nutrient loads.

AB  - Denitrification is a critical biogeochemical process that results in the conversion of nitrate to volatile products, and thus is a major route of nitrogen loss from terrestrial environments. Riparian buffers are an important management tool that is widely utilized to protect water from non-point source pollution. However, riparian buffers vary in their nitrate removal effectiveness, and thus there is a need for mechanistic studies to explore nitrate dynamics in buffer soils. The objectives of this study were to examine the influence of specific types of soluble organic matter on nitrate loss and nitrous oxide production rates, and to elucidate the relationships between these rates and the abundances of functional genes in a riparian buffer soil. Continuous-flow soil column experiments were performed to investigate the effect of three types of soluble organic matter (citric acid, alginic acid, and Suwannee River dissolved organic carbon) on rates of nitrate loss and nitrous oxide production. We found that nitrate loss rates increased as citric acid concentrations increased; however, rates of nitrate loss were weakly affected or not affected by the addition of the other types of organic matter. In all experiments, rates of nitrous oxide production mirrored nitrate loss rates. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to quantify the number of genes known to encode enzymes that catalyze nitrite reduction (i.e., nirS and nirK) in soil that was collected at the conclusion of column experiments. Nitrate loss and nitrous oxide production rates trended with copy numbers of both nir and 16s rDNA genes. The results suggest that low-molecular mass organic species are more effective at promoting nitrogen transformations than large biopolymers or humic substances, and also help to link genetic potential to chemical reactivity.

AB  - Substantial questions remain about the time required for groundwater nitrate to be reduced below 10 mg L- 1 following establishment of vegetated riparian buffers. The objective of this study was to document changes in groundwater nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations that occurred within a few years of planting a riparian buffer. In 2000 and 2001 a buffer was planted adjacent to a first-order stream in the deep loess region of western Iowa with strips of walnut and cottonwood trees, alfalfa and brome grass, and switch grass. Non-parametric statistics showed significant declines in NO3-N concentrations in shallow groundwater following buffer establishment, especially mid 2003 and later. The dissolved oxygen generally was > 5 mg L- 1 beneath the buffer, and neither NO3-N nor DO changed significantly under a non-buffered control area. These short-term changes in groundwater NO3-N provide evidence that vegetated riparian buffers may yield local water-quality benefits within a few years of planting.

AB  - This study develops an integrated economic, hydrologic, and ecological modelling framework to examine cost-effective targeting of riparian buffers to achieve water quality and wildlife habitat benefits. The framework is empirically applied to the Canagagigue Creek watershed in Ontario, Canada to compare the economic costs for establishing riparian buffers under three alternative environmental and ecological constraints: sediment abatement only, habitat improvement only, and riparian buffer acreage only. The results show that riparian buffers targeted for achieving sediment abatement goal are not effective in improving habitat quality. Similarly, riparian buffers identified through habitat improvement goal achieve less sediment abatement as compared to those targeted in the sediment abatement scenario. The trade-offs suggest that agricultural stewardship programmes with joint water quality and habitat improvement goals may need to allocate funds independently for targeting two pools of riparian buffers: for improving water quality only or for improving habitat only.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of riparian buffers between agricultural fields and waterbodies. Riparian buffers play an important role in mitigating the impacts of land use activities on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. However, evaluating the effectiveness of riparian buffer systems on a watershed scale is complex, and watershed models have limited capabilities for simulating riparian buffer processes. Thus, the overall objective of this paper is to develop an understanding of riparian buffer processes towards water quality modelling/monitoring and nonpoint source pollution assessment. The paper provides a thorough review of relevant literature on the performance of vegetative buffers on sediment reduction. It was found that although sediment trapping capacities are site- and vegetation-specific, and many factors influence the sediment trapping efficiency, the width of a buffer is important in filtering agricultural runoff and wider buffers tended to trap more sediment. Sediment trapping efficiency is also affected by slope, but the overall relationship is not consistent among studies. Overall, sediment trapping efficiency did not vary by vegetation type and grass buffers and forest buffers have roughly the same sediment trapping efficiency. This analysis can be used as the basis for planning future studies on watershed scale simulation of riparian buffer systems, design of effective riparian buffers for nonpoint source pollution control or water quality restoration and design of riparian buffer monitoring programs in watersheds.

AB  - The long-term sustainability of riparian management zones (RMZs) depends upon the maintenance of desirable ecosystem conditions within the riparian buffer. We assessed the change in understory vegetation (density and/or biomass of tree seedlings, saplings, woody shrubs, and herbs) in response to different levels of residual basal area within eight northern hardwood RMZs in northeastern Minnesota, USA. Three-year herbaceous cover, diversity, and species composition was investigated in a subset of four of these sites. RMZs were 46m wide and located next to upland clearcuts. Three overstory harvest treatments were applied in the RMZs: uncut controls with an average overstory basal area of 23m2ha−1, overstory basal area reduction to 16m2ha−1 in the medium-retention RMZs, and overstory basal area reduction to 8m2ha−1 in the low-retention RMZs. Both partial cut treatments followed best management practices to decrease management intensity towards stream banks, resulting in a gradient of decreasing residual basal area corresponding to increasing light availability with increasing distance from the stream. Understory shrub and sapling biomass, and density of small woody regeneration, including aspen/birch and beaked hazel, all increased in the partially harvested treatments by the third year following treatment, particularly in the low-retention RMZs. In all treatments, along the gradient of decreasing basal area with distance from the stream, small woody biomass and aspen/birch regeneration densities responded positively with distance to stream and increased light availability. Species with higher light requirements increased significantly with more light availability. In contrast, herbaceous species with higher nutrient and heat requirements responded negatively to increased light availability and increased distance to the stream, including in the controls. This response was large due to species differences between the location nearest to the stream and those further from the stream and most likely reflects different species compositions among fluvial landforms. While both partial harvesting treatments resulted in aspen regeneration densities within acceptable ranges for timber production standards, the lower (though not statistically significant) beaked hazel densities following the more conservative partial harvest treatment might be more favorable for the development of longer-lived conifer species in the long run. Further, many of the herbaceous responses were only observed at the extreme ends of the treatment gradient. Regardless of treatment, the edge effect on light availability, which extended at least 5m into the uncut control RMZ, may reduce the functional width (i.e., effectiveness) of the vegetation buffer.

AB  - Vegetative riparian buffers are considered as key zones in providing natural regulation functions for water quality aimed at intercepting non-point source (NPS) nutrients from upslope areas to surface water. The function for reducing NPS nutrients may perform better in some locations than in others because not all factors affecting nutrient mitigation are equal in all locations. This paper intended to develop a spatial multi-criteria planning scheme involving nutrient export and buffer characteristics to evaluate the buffer restoration priorities. The Liuxihe River basin, located in central Guangdong Province, was used as a case study area for this research. Six indicators, including total nitrogen export, total phosphorous export, mean buffer width, buffer gap ratio, vegetation vigor and soil erodibility, were all integrated to assess priority. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to simulate total nitrogen export and total phosphorous export traveling from upslope areas to the buffer. Other indicators representing the buffer mitigation potential of NPS nutrients were calculated with the help of the Geographic Information System (GIS). To reduce redundancy and objectively discriminate the importance among indicators, a principle component weighting method was used to ascribe weights to each indicator. Total nitrogen export and total phosphorous export, which quantified the NPS nutrients export, were assigned the highest weights of 3.30 and 3.16, respectively. The aggregation result of the multi-criteria analysis generated a distribution map ranking the buffer restoration priorities. The results suggested that restoring the riparian buffers in sub-basins located in the lower reaches of Liuxihe River basin should be a priority. This planning strategy can be applied as a useful supporting tool for water quality management on watershed scale.

AB  - We determined the extent that a riparian buffer reduces stream suspended sediment concentrations by filtering road runoff during 18 rain events in a 2.5-ha, multi-use watershed in northern Thailand. The dominant buffer species was the perennial sedge Fimbristylis aphylla Zoll. ex Steud. (Cyperaceae). We monitored stream sediment concentration for situations where road runoff either flowed into the riparian buffer or was diverted directly into the stream (buffer and no buffer scenarios). These data were used to develop the following relationships between instantaneous stream sediment concentration (C(i)) and discharge (Q(i)): C(i) = 28.329Q(i)0.851 (buffer scenario) and C(i) =
